        <p>Scientists around the world have aimed for a long time at developing miniaturized robots that can be controlled inside the human body to aid doctors in identifying and treating diseases. The visionary idea of performing non-invasive medical interventions by using tiny machines, postulated by Albert Hibbs and Richard Feynman back in 1959, 1 is not considered science fiction anymore, and is becoming a reality. These miniaturized robots, here called MRs are tiny structures with simple geometries such as rods, tubes, spheres, and helices, which can be propelled by chemical reactions, [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] physical fields, [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21] motile cells or microorganism inclusion, [22][23][24][25][26][27][28] and which can perform several functions, 27,[29][30][31][32][33][34][35] such as minimal invasive surgery, 13,36,37 sensing, [38][39][40] targeted drug delivery or diagnosis. 30,41 Precise control over MRs locomotion and function is necessary to enable target reaching and efficient task performance; however, fine control is possible only if information on MRs position and configuration is available. Few examples of MRs in living mice and small animals have been reported for cancer and bacterial infection treatments, [42][43][44][45][46] but the way ahead to the clinical practice and to high therapeutic efficiency is still long. In fact, despite a rapid development in the last decade, most of the MR applications demonstrated till now have been enabled by the use of optical microscopy in in vitro conditions and translating such approaches to an in vivo environment towards real medical applications is not straightforward. 47 Medical imaging techniques should be employed to visualize the physiological environment, including potential vascular routes and the target site for therapy, and for assessing the position of MRs in biological environment. In this framework, a wide plethora of medical imaging techniques are available. However, employing standard medical imaging techniques for microrobots localization is not trivial and many challenges still need to be faced in the attempt to identify the best compromise between spatiotemporal resolution, field of view (FoV), penetration depth and level of invasiveness associated with the imaging technique. The suitability of each imaging technique depends also on the working body districts and on the possible employment of swarm control strategies. For example, organs such as the eye or the skin can be analyzed using imaging techniques with low penetration depths. 48,49 In contrast, applications such as cancer treatment 50 in internal organs or assisted in vivo fertilization, 12,22 just to mention some examples, require deep tissue imaging.Scientists around the world have aimed for a long time at developing miniaturized robots that can be controlled inside the human body to aid doctors in identifying and treating diseases.

        <p>In this paper, we critically review the state of the art of MRs imaging in phantom, ex vivo, and in vivo, including both conventional and hybrid imaging techniques. A particular focus is given to the physics behind each technique in the attempt to unveil the opportunities and limitations of each imaging strategy with the aim to provide the readers with useful indications and guidelines to steer future research in the field of microrobotics. However, understanding the basic principles behind the different imaging strategies and analyzing their potentialities to resolve microscale structures in biological environment, will also be of interest for a wider healthcare research community interested in performing deep tissue imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution for investigating biological and synthetic mechanisms such as microcirculation, vascularization of implanted materials, cell migration, microrheology or any dynamic phenomena occurring at the micro and nanoscale.In this paper, we critically review the state of the art of MRs imaging in phantom, ex vivo, and in vivo, including both conventional and hybrid imaging techniques.

        <p>All imaging techniques share the same basic principle: a physical signal passes through the body/area under diagnosis and its interaction with the tissue causes transmission or reflection of the radiation which is then captured by a detector array and processed into an image pattern. 51 Different energy sources can be exploited ranging from electromagnetic fields (including light and high energy radiations) to ultrasound.All imaging techniques share the same basic principle: a physical signal passes through the body/area under diagnosis and its interaction with the tissue causes transmission or reflection of the radiation which is then captured by a detector array and processed into an image pattern. 51 Different energy sources can be exploited ranging from electromagnetic fields (including light and high energy radiations) to ultrasound.</p>
        <p>In this review paper, clinically established and widespread imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), optical and ionizing radiation-based techniques are defined as "conventional techniques" although they are continuously improving in terms of technical specifications for future potential applications. Based on the underlying physics, we classify the conventional techniques into (i) magnetic field, (ii) ultrasound, (iii) optical and (iv) ionizing radiation-based ones (Figure 1A). MRI and magnetic particle imaging (MPI) are described as magnetic field-based techniques whereas pulse-echo techniques, such as B-mode and Doppler-mode imaging, are included in the US-based techniques. Optical-based techniques to visualize MRs are classified into two groups, namely reflection-based imaging (RI) and fluorescence-based imaging (FI). Last, imaging techniques employing high energy radiation will be analyzed by describing in detail Computed Tomography (CT), X-rays, fluoroscopy, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) principles and employment in MRs localization and tracking. Although various other imaging techniques may be available, we discuss the most promising candidates for the localization and tracking of MRs in terms of three key parameters, namely spatial and temporal resolution as well as penetration depth (Figure 1B). Spatial resolution is the parameter which defines the minimal object size guaranteeing imaging or alternatively, which is the minimal distance possible between two objects to be discriminated from each other. Temporal resolution is the minimal time required to complete the data acquisition needed to reconstruct one complete image of the object.In this review paper, clinically established and widespread imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), optical and ionizing radiation-based techniques are defined as "conventional techniques" although they are continuously improving in terms of technical specifications for future potential applications.

        <p>Magnetic field-based techniques are well-established and widely used in biomedical imaging to investigate the anatomy, physiology of the body and to detect pathologies including tumors, inflammation, strokes or abnormalities in the heart or blood vessels. Magnetic fields in the range of few Teslas can propagate in deep tissues and interact as non-destructive radio waves. These interaction phenomena range from electrodynamic exchanges to the generation of mechanical forces and torques, and can be translated into detectable electrical signals. Magnetic-based techniques allow functional (by using magnetic tracers) and anatomical imaging (thanks to the spin of hydrogen atoms abundant in soft tissues), as in the case of MRI, but also measuring the spatial distribution of specific materials, as for the scenario of MPI. These two techniques typically rely on expensive coil-based equipment and call for dedicated powering sources and cooling systems that significantly increase the complexity of the imaging apparatus. Two key features of magnetic techniques lie in the high penetration depth, especially in MRI due to the low attenuation of magnetic fields across tissues, and in the possibility to combine imaging and manipulation of MRs with the same apparatus.Magnetic field-based techniques are well-established and widely used in biomedical imaging to investigate the anatomy, physiology of the body and to detect pathologies including tumors, inflammation, strokes or abnormalities in the heart or blood vessels.

        <p>MRI is particularly suitable to acquire 3D anatomical images of soft tissues and is used for this purpose in clinical practice. This can be achieved with a high spatial and temporal resolution with and without the use of specific contrast agents. Progress in MRI research has been tremendous in recent years, feedback control units have been significantly improved, and it has become one of the most appealing methods not only for medical imaging, but also for targeted minimally invasive therapies. 25,52,53 MRI is based on the principle of atomic spin relaxation. The term relaxation is used to describe the process by which a nuclear spin returns to thermal equilibrium after absorbing radiofrequency (RF) energy. 54 Three magnetic field stimuli are combined in MRI, namely a static magnetic field, electromagnetic RF signals and magnetic field gradients for localization (Figure 2A). 55 In MRI the nuclear spins of hydrogen atoms, naturally abundant in tissues and biological materials, align under the effect of high intensity static magnetic fields (typically between 1.5 and 3 T). Pulses of radio waves are employed to excite the nuclear spin energy transition, which tend to realign with the static field in the process of relaxation. There are two principal relaxation components, i.e. longitudinal and transverse, related to the time constants T1 and T2, respectively (Figure 2B). Magnetic field gradients allow for the localization of these signals in space.MRI is particularly suitable to acquire 3D anatomical images of soft tissues and is used for this purpose in clinical practice.

        <p>By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues (or non-biological objects as MRs can be) according to the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein. Based on its operating principle and on the capability of the technique to detect almost any kind of material, MRI can be considered as a label-free technique not calling for the employment of dedicated contrast or imaging agents. However, when considering micro-and nanoscale objects, magnetic materials could be employed to increase the signal intensity and enhance image quality. Superparamagnetic and paramagnetic agents, based on gadolinium ion complexes or on iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs), are particularly important as MRI contrast agents due to their high relaxivity (i.e. relaxation rate as a function of concentration). Magnetic materials subjected to the static magnetic field of a clinical MRI scanner produce a locally perturbing dipolar field with a shortening of the transverse relaxation time T2. 56 Based on the strength of the magnetic object, these distortions can be sufficiently large to detect MRs with overall dimensions smaller than the spatial resolution of any clinical imaging platform. Empirical observations suggest that an iron oxide particle distorts the magnetic field distribution over a region corresponding to about 50 times the particle size. 57 In this way, given that the typical size of a voxel in a standard 3T MRI scanner is about 500 μm, it is reasonable to say that single microrobot imaging could be foreseen for agents at least 10 μm in size (if magnetic properties are suitable enough) whereas swarm imaging appears more realistic for smaller or weaker magnetic microrobots.By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues (or non-biological objects as MRs can be) according to the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.

        <p>In the early works by Martel and co-workers, [58][59][60] MRI was one of the initial clinical imaging techniques to be employed in the micro/nanorobotics scenario. In addition, MRI scanners produce strong magnetic fields and gradients which can be exploited for navigation of magnetic microrobots. [61][62][63] Martel and co-workers used MRI to image and steer magnetotactic bacteria and magnetic beads in vitro and in vivo (e.g. swine) across the vasculature (Figure 2C-E). 59,64,65 Interesting works from this group dealt with thermoresponsive hydrogel-based magnetic soft microrobots for targeted drug delivery. 66 In most cases, MRI was employed to image swarms of MRs (few µm in size each). Zhang and co-workers successfully employed MRI to track in rodent stomachs a swarm of magnetic helical microswimmers, obtained from Spirulina microalgae via a facile dip-coating process in magnetite (Fe3O4) suspensions. 43 They demonstrated the higher penetration depth enabled by MRI in comparison with fluorescence-based imaging. However, MRI imaging of single agents has been demonstrated only at the millimeter scale. For instance, Fatikow and co-workers exploited imaging artifacts produced by a single mm-scale ferromagnetic object for MRI-enabled closed loop control (tracking and navigation). Path planning algorithms based on MRI data were integrated with a tracking module providing feedback on the position of the ferromagnetic object. 67 Reported works using MRI imaging to track MRs are summarized in Table 1.In the early works by Martel and co-workers, [58][59][60] MRI was one of the initial clinical imaging techniques to be employed in the micro/nanorobotics scenario.

        <p>Main challenges of medical MRI in the field of microrobotics are associated with spatial and temporal resolution. The spatial resolution is crucial for single microrobot visualization and for detecting events like target reaching, shape transformation or activation of drug delivery mechanisms. In MRI, the spatial resolution is directly proportional to the sampling rate of the relaxation signal, and inversely to FoV and slice thickness. Spatial resolution can also be improved by increasing the acquisition time, but that comes at a reduced framerate with inferior temporal resolution. In a previous study, the detection of a limited number of magnetic microrobots by MRI was achieved when increasing the acquisition time from seconds to few minutes. 68 For any specific application, an optimal compromise between spatial and temporal resolution needs to be identified. Furthermore, when combining MR-based navigation and MRI, we should consider that different magnetic field signals are required for the two purposes. This calls for the necessity of implementing time-dependent multiplexed sequences in which navigation and imaging alternate and control relies also on pre-operative path planning. Possible delays and navigation instabilities produced by the switching between imaging and actuation could be minimized by appropriate processing algorithms or by employing multimodal imaging strategies, e.g. combining MRI with X-ray CT imaging. 69 Alternatively, off-line imaging is often used to assess the targeting efficacy of microscale agents following the navigation phase and appears particularly interesting for MRs-based applications with low dynamics.

        <p>MPI was proposed in 2001 by Bernhard Gleich and Jürgen Weizenecker. 70 The technique allows quantifying the presence of paramagnetic material in the FoV upon saturation of their magnetization. MPI cannot image tissue but can assesses the 3D distribution of paramagnetic material (e.g. NPs). To build an MPI scanner, two permanent magnets are arranged in a Maxwell configuration (i.e. opposing each other with identical poles) so that the magnetic field intensity is null in the central region of the arrangement, named the field-free point (FFP). Electromagnetic drive coils produce a time-varying magnetic field in the imaging area and dedicated pick-up coils detect changes in the NPs magnetization. Magnetization saturation of particles produces non-linear effects that generate harmonics which intensity is proportional to the particle's concentration. The static gradient field allows for spatial encoding and for detecting the origin of the signal. More specifically, at the FFP the particles magnetization is free to follow the drive field whereas outside the FFP the particles are saturated by the high-intensity static field, thus not producing any detectable signal (Figure 3A).MPI was proposed in 2001 by Bernhard Gleich and Jürgen Weizenecker. 70 The technique allows quantifying the presence of paramagnetic material in the FoV upon saturation of their magnetization.

        <p>The FFP can be moved in space by introducing additional time-varying focus fields through the drive coils. This enables 3D volume scans with high temporal resolution within spherical workspaces of 10-20 cm in diameter.

        <p>The spatial resolution of MPI increases with the intensity of the magnetic field gradient and with the particle's magnetic susceptibility. It lies in the range of one to few millimeters for currently developed MPI scanners. 71 In the past decade, researchers have reported promising results regarding the use of MPI for the visualization and navigation of small magnetic devices. The high-intensity field gradients generated within the scanner workspace allow to pull and actuate magnetic objects. In 2016, Gleich and coworkers demonstrated 1-D and 2-D closed-loop control and imaging of a millimeter-scale magnetic device using a prototype MPI setup. 72 Analogously to MRI, imaging and actuation require different drive field sequences in MPI. For this reason, controlled navigation is performed in a quasi-simultaneous manner by time-dependent multiplexed sequences in which actuation and imaging alternate. For this reason, even if imaging can be performed at very high frame rates, the achievable control frequency is limited by the time required by magnetic actuation.The spatial resolution of MPI increases with the intensity of the magnetic field gradient and with the particle's magnetic susceptibility. It lies in the range of one to few millimeters for currently developed MPI scanners. 71 In the past decade, researchers have reported promising results regarding the use of MPI for the visualization and navigation of small magnetic devices. The high-intensity field gradients generated within the scanner workspace allow to pull and actuate magnetic objects. In 2016, Gleich and coworkers demonstrated 1-D and 2-D closed-loop control and imaging of a millimeter-scale magnetic device using a prototype MPI setup. 72 Analogously to MRI, imaging and actuation require different drive field sequences in MPI. For this reason, controlled navigation is performed in a quasi-simultaneous manner by time-dependent multiplexed sequences in which actuation and imaging alternate. For this reason, even if imaging can be performed at very high frame rates, the achievable control frequency is limited by the time required by magnetic actuation.</p>

        <p>Smart materials can improve the spatial resolution of MPI. In 2019, Bakenecker and coworkers reported a 3D-printed millimeter-scale helical swimmer (2 mm in length) and navigated it through a vessel phantom with an MPI scanner (Figure 3D). 75 The swimmer was coated with paramagnetic NPs (130 nm in diameter) to enable both imaging and navigation. With this setup, it was possible to obtain images of the navigated propeller (sub-millimeter resolution) at 10 frames per second (fps). In 2020, Griese and coworkers performed a comparative study in which swarms of different NPs were navigated through a vessel phantom in bifurcation flow by an MPI scanner. 76 They found dextran-coated iron oxide NPs with 250 nm diameter to provide the best compromise in terms of magnetic manipulability and imaging performance.Smart materials can improve the spatial resolution of MPI.

        <p>Overall, fast localization and strong forces due to the high field gradient render an MPI system as a good platform for image-guided steering of magnetic devices. Nevertheless, some limitations still hamper the translation of this technology into clinically-relevant scenarios. On one hand, more research efforts are needed to scale up the platforms and to enable human-sized workspaces, while guaranteeing good imaging performances. On the other hand, the spatial resolution seeks for improvement (a few millimeters with current platforms).

        <p>Amongst conventional techniques, US-based imaging stands as one of the most promising solutions for providing real-time feedback on microrobot position in deep tissue. It is a mature technology regularly used in clinical settings for diagnostic purposes. Compared to other conventional techniques, US combines high spatial and temporal resolution with minimum adverse effects on tissues and lower equipment cost. In US imaging, pulses of pressure waves are emitted by a piezoelectric transducer. When the waves encounter acoustic impedance discontinuities, they are partially scattered back towards the source. 77 The backscattered echo signal is registered by the transducer and can be processed to extrapolate information regarding the whole journey of the transmitted wave. Several US beams can be independently shot and registered back by an array of piezoelectric elements (US probe) to acquire adjacent scan lines which are then combined to reconstruct a 2D tomographic image, also known as a frame. In this review, we are going to discuss two different established US imaging modalities, namely B-mode and Doppler, which look particularly suitable for MR tracking.Amongst conventional techniques, US-based imaging stands as one of the most promising solutions for providing real-time feedback on microrobot position in deep tissue.

        <p>B-mode US is a pulse-echo imaging modality in which a pulse wave is transmitted by the US probe and the echoes generated by the interaction of the wave with the propagating media are processed to reconstruct an image of the insonated region (i.e. the region exposed to ultrasound). Assuming to transmit a sinusoidal pulse along a single scan line, the detected echo 𝐸 * (𝑡) can be expressed as:B-mode US is a pulse-echo imaging modality in which a pulse wave is transmitted by the US probe and the echoes generated by the interaction of the wave with the propagating media are processed to reconstruct an image of the insonated region (i.e. the region exposed to ultrasound). Assuming to transmit a sinusoidal pulse along a single scan line, the detected echo 𝐸 * (𝑡) can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>where 𝐴(𝑡) is the amplitude of the signal, 𝑓 is the carrier frequency of the transmitted pulse and 𝜑(𝑡) is the phase. The instantaneous amplitude 𝐴(𝑡), also known as the envelope of the signal, carries information about the pressure intensity that is locally backscattered by all objects along the path of the scan line. In brightness-mode (B-mode) imaging, 𝐴(𝑡) is converted into brightness levels to create a contrast image of the object (Figure 4A). When propagating in human tissues, US waves are strongly absorbed by bones (producing acoustic shadows) and highly reflected by air sacs. Due to its strong echogenicity (i.e. the property of backscattering US waves), the air is generally used as a contrast agent, for instance in the form of microbubbles. These are micronsized spheres consisting of a gas core surrounded by a lipid shell which act as echo-enhancers. 78 In B-mode imaging, the temporal resolution depends on the speed of sound in the medium (about 1500 m/s in soft tissues) 79 and on the FoV. Typical frame rates are in the order of 50-100 fps, while greater rates are achieved by plane wave imaging (&gt;1000 fps). 80 The spatial resolution is defined by two parameters, namely axial and lateral resolution. The lateral resolution depends on the geometry of the US probe since it is related to the distance between the piezoelectric elements of the probe array. Axial resolution is related to the wavelength of the transmitted pulse (typically 100-500µm) and thus to both the characteristics of the transducer (center frequency) and the properties of the medium (speed of sound). Due to wave diffraction, objects with characteristic dimensions comparable to the US wavelength are not well resolved. Ideally, axial resolution is defined by one half of the transmitted pulse wavelength. However, as a result of the combined effect of the physical processes involved (i.e. scattering and diffraction) and of the reconstruction procedure (e.g. imaging artifacts), the axial resolution of a B-mode image is usually worse than the ideal value. 81 A higher axial resolution can be obtained by increasing the transmission frequency, yet at the expense of the penetration depth (wave attenuation increases with frequency). Altogether, axial resolution can vary between hundreds of micrometers at 3-4 cm depth for 12-15 MHz US waves as those employed in Doppler-mode diagnostics, to millimeters at 20 cm depths for 3-5 MHz US waves, generally used in standard abdominal B-mode imaging. 82 In the past few years, researchers have accomplished encouraging results in the localization and tracking of microrobots through B-mode imaging. In 2014, Misra and coworkers demonstrated that point-to-point control of a magnetic sphere (100 µm in diameter) could be achieved with position feedback extrapolated from B-mode images. 83 The authors reported an average position tracking error about half the microsphere size while navigating it in 2x2 cm arena. The same setup was used for tracking the trail of bubbles (spot size of ~300 µm) from a single self-propelled microjet in vitro with a characteristic length of 50 µm (Figure 4B). 84 To localize such a small microjet in the imaging plane, they exploited the echogenicity (i.e. characteristics of large wave reflection) of gas bubble trails produced by catalysis-based propulsion. However, the average position tracking error reported in this case was 250.7 ± 164.7 µ𝑚, about 5 times the characteristic length of the micromotor. To achieve better performances, in 2018 they developed a model-based tracking system able to achieve ultra-fast localization of millimeter-scale hydrogel grippers from B-mode images with an average position tracking error of 25 ± 7 µ𝑚 (over one percent the dimension of the gripper). 85 The same group recently demonstrated 3D position control of a magnetic sphere (800 µm in diameter) under US guidance. 86 To achieve 3D localization with 2D US tomographic images, the transducer was swept along the vertical direction to identify the horizontal plane containing the microrobot. The target plane (2D image) was thus processed by a tracker to extrapolate the remaining two coordinates. Promising results were reported also in ex vivo studies where different tasks of millimeter-scale robots were monitored through B-mode images. Qiu and coworkers exploited B-mode images for the localization of a helical propeller (characteristic length of 2 mm) moving in rat liver. 87 Cappelleri and coworkers used B-mode imaging to monitor a sub-millimetric tumbling microrobot capable of releasing the therapeutic payload in the dissected colon. 88 Sitti and coworkers used B-mode images to visualize the multimodal locomotion of a milli-robot within ex vivo chicken tissue. 14 However, none of these microrobot was smaller than 800 µm.where 𝐴(𝑡) is the amplitude of the signal, 𝑓 is the carrier frequency of the transmitted pulse and 𝜑(𝑡) is the phase.

        <p>Alternatively, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is a promising approach to achieve superresolution. In ULM, the US signal scattered by microbubbles is processed along thousands of acquired frames to resolve images below the acoustic diffraction limit. With this technique, Lin and coworkers obtained US images with a pixel size of 10x10 µm using a 8 MHz transducer (featuring a diffraction limit of 100 µm). 101 Although promising, ULM has some bottlenecks for real-time MRs tracking. First of all, it is strongly dependent on a high dosage of contrast agent, not easily equipped on board a MR and secondly, it features poor temporal resolution. In fact, each ULM image was processed from 8000 acquired US frames, meaning more than a minute of acquisition with standard settings. Yu and coworkers 102 proposed a deconvolution method with which they reduced the acquisition time for each ULM image to about 6 s and other groups are working in the same direction, [103][104][105] but more efforts are required to make this method real-time.Alternatively, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is a promising approach to achieve superresolution.

        <p>This US-based imaging technique relies on the Doppler effect, by which US waves that interact with moving objects experience a shift in their travelling frequency. More specifically, if two pulses are shot consecutively with a certain pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and interact with an object that has moved in the direction of wave propagation, the two echoes will show a difference in travelling frequency that is linearly related to the velocity of the moving object. This effect applies to all motion directions by considering their projection along the wave propagation direction. The Doppler signal is extracted through quadrature demodulation techniques 81 and is converted to a measure of the velocity of the imaged objects. The PRF, which relates to the temporal resolution is actually the Doppler signal sampling rate. According to the Shannon theorem such sampling rate sets the maximal detectable Doppler shift. In the past years, Doppler imaging has been used for the visualization and control in 3D of vibrating tethered robotic devices such as microneedles 106 and instruments for cardiac interventions. 107 More recently, the use of this technique in microrobotic applications has been investigated. In 2019, Sitti and coworkers proposed hairbot, a microscale device derived from hair tissues. 96 The functionalization of such devices with superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) enabled the interaction with stem cells in microenvironments through magnetic actuation. Doppler imaging was used to image the hairbots after injection in ex vivo chicken breast (Figure 4D). Other studies reported promising results in the fabrication of nanoagents for continuous Doppler contrast. Liberman and coworkers synthesized gas-filled silica nanoshells that can be detected in vivo using color Doppler imaging with great lifespans (over 11 days) (Figure 4E). 97 These studies highlighted how, at least in principle, microrobots could be functionalized with Doppler contrast agents to achieve robust localization in tissues. Unlike Bmode imaging, the Doppler principle does not involve the amplitude of backscattered US waves, thus making it an effective tool for detecting moving objects in dynamic and echogenic environments, as body tissues are.

        <p>Optical imaging utilizes non-ionizing radiation sources such as lasers or LEDs. Such techniques are relatively fast, safe and low cost and offer high spatial (order of few µm) and temporal (order of millisecond to seconds) resolutions. However, most optical techniques suffer from low penetration depth in biological tissues and are still limited to the investigations at sub-surface levels, typically between hundreds of micrometers and rarely beyond 1 mm deep. 108,109 Light penetration into tissues is limited by scattering and absorption at different biomolecules and endogenous chromophores and varies with tissue properties. These properties can be described by the mean free path (MFP) which is the average distance a photon travels between two scattering or absorption events and is defined as:Optical imaging utilizes non-ionizing radiation sources such as lasers or LEDs.

        <p>where μs and μa are the scattering and absorption coefficients, respectively. 109 One strategy to overcome the limited penetration depth of optical techniques is to choose an appropriate wavelength window which can significantly reduce the tissue autofluorescence and light absorption. It is the case of the two biological windows in the NIR range respectively at 650-950 nm (NIR-I) 1000-1350 nm (NIR-II). For higher penetration depths, the use of wavelengths from the second biological window is desirable as it has been demonstrated elsewhere. 110 Hence, in the appropriate wavelength range, μs is much larger than μa for most of the tissues e.g. muscle, brain, breast and lung tissues, and the MFP can be approximated to 1/μs. Scattering in biological tissues occurs predominantly in the forward direction (direction in which the light strikes the tissue). This is considered by the anisotropy factor "g" which defines the degree of forward scattering (g=1 meaning the total forward scattering and g=-1 the total backscattering). Typical values for biological samples are in the range of g~0.9. The transport MFP (TMFP) considers the MFP and the average angle in which photons are scattered and is linked to the MFP by the reduced scattering coefficient μs′= μs(1-g). It is defined as TMFP = 1/μs′. 109 Another strategy to improve the penetration depth is to tune the emission features of target objectswhere μs and μa are the scattering and absorption coefficients, respectively. 109 One strategy to overcome the limited penetration depth of optical techniques is to choose an appropriate wavelength window which can significantly reduce the tissue autofluorescence and light absorption. It is the case of the two biological windows in the NIR range respectively at 650-950 nm (NIR-I) 1000-1350 nm (NIR-II). For higher penetration depths, the use of wavelengths from the second biological window is desirable as it has been demonstrated elsewhere. 110 Hence, in the appropriate wavelength range, μs is much larger than μa for most of the tissues e.g. muscle, brain, breast and lung tissues, and the MFP can be approximated to 1/μs. Scattering in biological tissues occurs predominantly in the forward direction (direction in which the light strikes the tissue). This is considered by the anisotropy factor "g" which defines the degree of forward scattering (g=1 meaning the total forward scattering and g=-1 the total backscattering). Typical values for biological samples are in the range of g~0.9. The transport MFP (TMFP) considers the MFP and the average angle in which photons are scattered and is linked to the MFP by the reduced scattering coefficient μs′= μs(1-g).

        <p>Optical techniques are widely used in body districts where the scattering of tissues is relatively low, e.g. in ophthalmology, sub-skin intervention and small animal experiments. As the penetration depth of light in tissue is comparably small, optical techniques are mostly used in reflection rather than transmission configuration, meaning that the illumination and detection are done with a singlesided optical access to the sample. RI does not rely on the emission of a fluorescent probe, but on the intrinsic reflection or backscattering properties of the sample. NPs or thin metal layers incorporated on target samples can be used to enhance signal reflectivity. In this regard, gold (Au) is one of the most suitable materials for its biocompatibility and high reflectivity over a broad spectral range. 111 However, when scattering scrambles both the illumination and the backscattered light, a high amount of background light occurs, which strongly reduces the signal to noise ratio (SNR). In the worst case, the scattered light saturates the detector and no sample information can be recorded. To reduce saturation and scattering, depth sectioning techniques can be employed. In this regard, confocal microscopy is based on filtering out-of-focus light using a pinhole. 112,113 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an interferometric technique that was developed by Fujimoto's group 114 in 1991 and takes advantage of the short coherence length of a light source which allows to record coherence gated images and obtain µm-scale cross-sectional imaging of the target. OCT provides improved spatial resolution (1-10 µm) in scattering tissue, but with high acquisition times due to the point-wise (time-domain OCT) or line-wise (frequency-domain OCT)scanning mode, thus avoiding real-time imaging. [115][116][117] Several studies reported the use of OCT imaging for tracking microagents in real-time. For instance, Li and co-workers employed a frequency-domain OCT setup to track magnetically-driven spherical microrobot (90 µm in diameter) in vivo in the portal vein of mice at a penetration depth of ~1.6 mm, with a line scanning rate of 5.5-70 kHz. 118 The same technique was also used to track reflective particles (polystyrene, 2 µm in diameter) as contrast agents to improve OCT imaging contrast in ex vivo mice liver and in vivo in zebrafish. 119 Likewise, SiO2 particles (1.2 µm in diameter, half-coated with a thin film of Au) were functionalized with a specific antibody that recognizes a biomarker (cardiac troponin I) of acute myocardial infarction to perform on-chip nonspectroscopic optical immunosensing. 120 By using the same principle, Nelson's group tracked the position of a microrobot (size: 285×1800 µm) for minimally invasive intraocular surgery. The magnetic robots were steered using rotating magnetic fields in ex vivo porcine eyes as well as in vivo in lapin eyes and consecutive images were acquired at a speed of 15 Hz. 48 The same group implemented optical microscopy combined with an electromagnetic coil system (8 coils arranged in a hemispherical configuration) and proposed a cylindrical millimetric (1x0.5 mm) robotic system for vascular retinal surgery in an eye model (human-like model eye) with and without eye's lens (Figure 5B, i-ii). 121 An algorithm was proposed to localize the millimetric device based on its 3D structure. More recently, a similar concept was proposed to track magnetically driven micromotors employing IR light at a wavelength of 970 nm for performing in-situ microrheology analysis. 122 These reflective micromotors were successfully visualized with high spatial (about 20 µm) and temporal resolution (ms range) within scattering phantoms and ex vivo mouse skull tissues (Figure 5C). The reported penetration limit was 0.32 TMFP, corresponding to about 160 µm depth in real mouse skull tissues. The main limiting factor of the employed setup was the limited dynamic range of the camera. Strategies such as pulsed laser excitation, and the usage of wavelengths of the NIR-II optical window would improve the achievable penetration depth. While the discussed methods suppress the scattered light, they result in a strong reduction of the SNR. In the Future Perspectives section, we will present methods that exploit the scattered light enabling increased SNR and penetration depth.Optical techniques are widely used in body districts where the scattering of tissues is relatively low, e.g. in ophthalmology, sub-skin intervention and small animal experiments.

        <p>The idea to use tomography in medical imaging dates back to 1895 when X-rays were discovered by W. C. Roentgen, but it took almost a century for the successful CT imaging device to be built. 134 X-rays are typically produced through a vacuum tube employing high voltage to accelerate electrons from a cathode to a tungsten alloy anode. During this acceleration process, the electrons release electromagnetic radiation in the form of X-rays. This kind of radiation transmits enough energy to ionize atoms and disrupt molecular bonds (also known as ionizing radiation). In general, such high energy allows high penetration depths, thus imaging of deep body regions. In X-rays imaging the sample is positioned between an emitter and a detector (Figure 6A). An image of the sample is reconstructed through the differences in radiation absorption across different materials: materials with high absorption coefficients cause a reduction in the radiation dose reaching the detector and appear visible in the produced radiograph.

        <p>Nuclear imaging techniques rely on the detection of γ-rays (wavelengths lower than 0.1 nm). These radiations can be either emitted by radioisotopes, as in the case of Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) or generated upon positron-electron annihilation as in the case of Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The detection of the emitted γ-rays with tomographic techniques enables the 3D reconstruction of the distribution of γ-emitting compounds, thus the imaging of a target region. The γ-rays possess high energy and can penetrate deep across different kinds of medium, thus enabling deep tissue imaging in human-scale workspaces. However, nuclear imaging itself provides poor information on morphological and anatomical features and call for the employment of specific tracers (i.e. imaging agents) able to emit γ-rays. 143 PET and SPECT are minimally invasive high-resolution techniques which enable quantitative estimation of the number of radio-labeled species available in a specific location.

        <p>On the other hand, these techniques have bottlenecks related to large acquisition time preventing real-time imaging, to the high cost of the imaging apparatus and to the limited life-time of radioemitting compounds. This makes these techniques more suitable for assessing an efficient target reaching and for post-operative monitoring than for fast position tracking. The radiation dose is also a critical point. However, when employing SPECT or PET for microrobots imaging, the absorbed radiation dose is significantly lower than the levels reached in X-ray CT. The reason is that in CT an external X-ray source/detector arrangement performs a 360° rotation to irradiate all the body's anatomy, while in nuclear techniques the source of radiation is limited to the very small volume of the microrobots.On the other hand, these techniques have bottlenecks related to large acquisition time preventing real-time imaging, to the high cost of the imaging apparatus and to the limited life-time of radioemitting compounds.

        <p>PAI has emerged as a fast-developing medical imaging technique in the last decade 109,[150][151][152][153] and was introduced by Alexander Graham Bell 154 in 1880 upon observation of the sound waves generated by the sunlight. PAI relies on the 'light-in, sound-out' approach: IR light penetrates the biological tissue and generates ultrasonic waves following the absorption of light. Short-pulsed or periodically modulated electromagnetic radiation is delivered with wide-field illumination and is absorbed by specific chromophores which cause localized and rapid increase in temperature andin turn -US pressure waves. The contrast of PA images comes from the distribution of the absorbed optical energy and is thus related to the optical properties of the tissues and the wavelength of the incident light. 155 The sound waves generated from the optical absorbers are detected with US transducers and are reconstructed by using image generation algorithms. 156 PAI takes advantages of endogenous chromophores (e.g. lipids, melanin, hemoglobin) available in the body or exogenous contrast agents which absorb light at specific characteristic wavelengths 159,160 thus enabling their detection and identification with respect to the surrounding tissues and structures. 161,162 For instance, oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin can provide anatomical functional information of vascular structures including blood oxygen saturation , flowrate and metabolism by employing multi-wavelength excitation. 150,[163][164][165] PAI has the advantage of spectrally unmix the absorption spectra from diverse sources of absorption, thus enabling to discriminate structures and processes based on their composition or on the involved molecules. A rich choice of exogenous contrast agents (dyes, NPs and reporter genes) can be used for molecular imaging.

The capsules were prepared with Au, a mixture of alginate and Doxorubicin, and parylene-C, all encapsulated in enteric protective capsules (using the emulsion method) 174 to prevent reactions with gastric acids while passing through the stomach. After reaching the target site, continuous NIR irradiation (808 nm, 2W) induced disintegration of the protective capsules and doxorubicin release.

        <p>In contrast to MPI, in MMUS the signal detected from the tracers motion does not allow to quantitatively estimate their distribution in the FoV. The reason is that NPs motion depends not only on magnetic quantities (e.g. magnetization curve, magnetic excitation signal) which are known, but also on the concentration of NPs that effectively accumulate in the site and on the viscoelastic properties of the surrounding medium which are usually unknown. Current research is aiming at developing MMUS algorithms for quantitative assessment of NPs distribution (known as the inverse MMUS problem) by comparison of MMUS images with offline simulated models (Figure 8C). 187 Assessing the spatial resolution of MMUS is not straightforward.

        <p>The X-rays feature high resolution and deep penetration in body tissues but require expensive instrumentation. Furthermore, potential ionization can eventually cause damage to the medical personnel/patient, calling for the need of tuning radiation dose and exposure time. On the other hand, optical imaging methods based on fluorescence or reflection are somehow safe and carry high spatial resolution but have reduced tissue penetration which limits their application to subskin/superficial levels. MRI enables deep tissue imaging without any contrast agent along with acceptable spatial and temporal resolution but requires strong magnetic fields and expensive infrastructure. US alone suffers from spatial resolution but provide real-time monitoring and deep tissue penetration together with low cost and high safety. Table 1 summarizes the main results and performances obtained with conventional and hybrid imaging techniques in the field of microrobotics while underlying their employment in imaging/tracking a single or swarm of MRs in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo conditions. As underlined in the previous sections, most of the MRs imaging and tracking works reported till now have demonstrated the potentialities of medical imaging in MRs tracking and localization mainly in vitro or in tissue-mimicking phantoms. Just a few demonstrations combining in vivo localization and closed-loop imaging assisted position control have been reported.

Furthermore, potential ionization can eventually cause damage to the medical personnel/patient, calling for the need of tuning radiation dose and exposure time. On the other hand, optical imaging methods based on fluorescence or reflection are somehow safe and carry high spatial resolution but have reduced tissue penetration which limits their application to subskin/superficial levels. MRI enables deep tissue imaging without any contrast agent along with acceptable spatial and temporal resolution but requires strong magnetic fields and expensive infrastructure. US alone suffers from spatial resolution but provide real-time monitoring and deep tissue penetration together with low cost and high safety. Table 1 summarizes the main results and performances obtained with conventional and hybrid imaging techniques in the field of microrobotics while underlying their employment in imaging/tracking a single or swarm of MRs in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo conditions. As underlined in the previous sections, most of the MRs imaging and tracking works reported till now have demonstrated the potentialities of medical imaging in MRs tracking and localization mainly in vitro or in tissue-mimicking phantoms.

        <p>One of the big difficulties and challenges for in vivo MRs applications is performing non-invasive, real-time, deep-tissue, high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging. Scientists are currently working to improve several imaging techniques that could be applied based on their performances and working principle for MRs tracking. This section will mainly focus on how the employment of suitable contrast agents can significantly enhance imaging quality. Some of the limitations of current imaging techniques for the tracking of MRs can be mitigated by incorporating suitable contrast agents varying by imaging modality as highlighted in Table 2. A multi-modal MR is also proposed embedding frontier contrast mechanism for multifunctional medical MRs (Figure 9).One of the big difficulties and challenges for in vivo MRs applications is performing non-invasive, real-time, deep-tissue, high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging.

        <p>MRI relies on contrast mechanisms to enlarge the difference in the relaxation times between different objects and its specificity may be improved through the development of relevant contrast agents. Current research is investigating the potentialities of MRI contrast mechanisms based on Quadrupole Relaxation Enhancement (QRE). Specifically, the interaction between water protons and suitable quadrupolar nuclei can lead to QRE of proton spins (provided the resonance condition between both spin transitions is fulfilled 195 ). This effect could be utilized as a frequency selective mechanism in T1 shortening contrast agents for MRI. Theoretically, the contrast enhancement factors of QRE are smaller than those of typical paramagnetic contrast agents. However, this mechanism depends on the characteristics of the applied external flux density, a property that can be exploited to enhance the relative contrast of properly designed materials with special fieldcycling MRI scanners. 196 So far, QRE has been observed for solids (in most cases for 14 N) as a result of very slow dynamics and anisotropic spin interactions, believed to be necessary for QRE to appear. However, a recent study has shown the evidence that QRE can be achieved in solutions containing a high spin nucleus (209Bi) as the quadrupole element, for the exploration of QRE in biomedical MRI and perhaps in MRs imaging and tracking. 197 Concerning MPI, suited contrast agents exhibiting very steep magnetization curves may be explored to further increase spatial resolution. It has been demonstrated that increasing the NP core size improves the magnetic susceptibility (steepness of magnetization curve) and leads to higher spatial resolution. However, this effect is limited by the so-called relaxation wall (25 nm core diameter), which causes blurring in images due to relaxation losses. 198 Recent studies highlighted that low-amplitude and low-frequency drive field parameters help mitigating relaxation losses. Concerning optical imaging, conventional IR imaging (FI and RI) uses the first biological window with a wavelength range from 700 to 950 nm (NIR-I), and recent advances suggest the use of the second biological window (NIR-II, 1000-1400 nm) for deeper tissue penetration, reduced autofluorescence, minimum photon scattering and better SNR. 110,203 Almost 16 years ago, simulations suggested it would be possible to improve SNR by 100-fold using fluorophores with emission peaks at around 1320 nm (NIR-II). 204 Since then, there was not much progress due to the lack of biocompatible fluorescent labels in that range. Early reports were mainly focused on II-VI (CdTe and HgTe), 205 IV-VI (PbS and PbSe) 206 and III-V (InAs) 207 QDs. However, the intrinsic toxic nature of Pb, Cd, and As made them unfit for prolonged in vivo applications. A recent class of biocompatible QDs, I-VI (Ag2S and Ag2Se) emitting in NIR-II is demonstrated as a promising fluorescent probe.

        <p>Magneto-optic imaging (MOI) is another hybrid imaging technique that combines an electromagnetic effect (eddy current or magnetic flux leakage) and the Faraday effect to generate a two-dimensional image. This technique was proposed and developed in the 1990s. 224 The propagation of light through a magnetic field is used to image target objects (e.g. defects or cracks in the surface of an object). A pulse generator sends an alternating current to the excitation coil which induces eddy currents in the sample. These eddy currents induce in turn magnetic fields when encountering any defect or damage in the sample surface. If the sample is illuminated by polarized light, the defect-induced magnetic field modulates the polarized light that now contains the information on the magnetic field distribution, which correlates to the surface defect. The reflected polarized light is captured by a CCD or CMOS camera to form a 2D real-time image of the target (Figure 10B).Magneto-optic imaging (MOI) is another hybrid imaging technique that combines an electromagnetic effect (eddy current or magnetic flux leakage) and the Faraday effect to generate a two-dimensional image.

The MOI technique was mainly dedicated to identify defects/cracks in thin films. 226 By taking advantage of this, the MRs can be designed with small cracks/defects during the fabrication process using various lithography techniques (e.g. photolithography, 3D lithography, e-beam lithography or stamp printers). Of course, limitations imposed by light penetration have to be considered to verify the feasibility of this approach in a target district. Future study shall focus on imaging magnetic MRs and fabricating suitable designs of such robots thus sufficient reflected polarized light is detected from the target robot for MOI visualization.

        <p>Magneto-acoustic tomography (MAI) employs high frequency (MHz range) pulsed magnetic fields to induce vibrations within tissues loaded with magnetic NPs. Particles vibrations produce mechanical waves which are registered through an external transducer and processed to reconstruct the magnetic material distribution (Figure 10C). Differently from MMUS, in which motions induced by continuous low frequency magnetic fields are detected through pulse-echo US sequencing. In MAI the transducer is only used as a receiver. This allows the MAI to have improved imaging bandwidth, limited mainly by the receiving bandwidth of the transducer, leading to better resolution. In addition, as compared to traditional US imaging, acoustic waves in MAI travel shorter paths and experience reduced attenuation in tissues, which leads to improved imaging depth. Because of the pulsed nature of the magnetic excitation signal, MAI allows also to reduce thermal issues related to continuous excitation, featured for instance by MMUS.

        <p>This latter method combines pulsed fields with static ones to generate acoustic waves through Lorentz force, which can be processed to estimate with high resolution the conductivity distribution of the source. Till now the technique has been employed to either estimate the distribution of magnetic NPs in the FoV, as is the case of simple MAI, 227 or for assessing tissue bioimpedance through MAI-MI. 228 Further research shall consider this technique to push forward tracking of MRs in biological tissues, in order to exploit improved resolution and higher penetration depth compared to other US-based techniques. The main challenges of translating this technology to real-time tracking are related to the improvement of temporal resolution, currently limited by the need of mechanically scanning the transducer at least 180 degrees around the object in order to reconstruct a MAI image. A solution to avoid transducer revolution could be the use of arrays of transducers positioned around the object, although scaling such setup to clinical size is not trivial. Finally, interesting perspectives can be envisioned by the integration of functional materials such as magnetostrictive 229 or magnetoelectric 230 composites, which may enhance US signal or even produce distinct signatures for the detection of MRs.This latter method combines pulsed fields with static ones to generate acoustic waves through Lorentz force, which can be processed to estimate with high resolution the conductivity distribution of the source.

        <p>Good contrast single carrier allows for the development of multimodal and hybrid contrast agents, for instance exhibiting optimal contrast properties over a range of different X-ray tube potentials or being suitable for more than one imaging modality (e.g. combination of X-ray and MRI). A good perspective is also represented by the potential translation of X-ray luminescent (XL) and X-ray fluorescence (XF) into biomedical imaging domain. These computed tomography techniques use external X-rays to stimulate secondary emissions (either light or secondary X-rays). These modalities surpass the limits of sensitivity in current X-ray imaging and promise to break through the spatial resolution limits of other in vivo molecular imaging modalities. 215 Smart materials can be investigated to explore the use of these phenomena in microrobotics applications.

[247][248][249][250] However, with such techniques the exact position and movement in three dimensions is difficult to be extracted quantitatively. A possible way to achieve imaging and tracking in deep-tissue in a minimally invasive manner could be the usage of thin lens-less endoscopes, with diameters &lt;350 µm, that are driven with wavefront shaping techniques. 251,252 Thus, wavefront shaping is a promising tool that will surely lead to further improvement in microscopy techniques, enabling imaging in deep tissues. Employing SLMs allows to do nearly anything with light waves, even to transfer image information through centimeters of tissue. The main task is to find strategies, how to get the required information to determine the appropriate phase mask. When wavefront shaping approaches will be optimized for tracking MRs, this will surely be a step towards clinical applications, as the fundamental limit of light penetration in tissue is not the physics but the technology and methodology in this still infant research topic. description of the wavefront shaping technique for imaging through a scattering medium. A sample is illuminated by a laser source and the speckle illuminating the sample returns in phase opposition through the scattering medium. The SLMs manipulate the phase of light by displaying an appropriate mask on the SLMs which remove the influence of a scattered light-field distribution through thick scattering tissues.Good contrast single carrier allows for the development of multimodal and hybrid contrast agents, for instance exhibiting optimal contrast properties over a range of different X-ray tube potentials or being suitable for more than one imaging modality (e.g. combination of X-ray and MRI). A good perspective is also represented by the potential translation of X-ray luminescent (XL) and X-ray fluorescence (XF) into biomedical imaging domain. These computed tomography techniques use external X-rays to stimulate secondary emissions (either light or secondary X-rays). These modalities surpass the limits of sensitivity in current X-ray imaging and promise to break through the spatial resolution limits of other in vivo molecular imaging modalities. 215 Smart materials can be investigated to explore the use of these phenomena in microrobotics applications.
