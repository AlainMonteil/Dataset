        <p>At present, the limited existence of fossil fuels and the environmental issues over greenhouse gas emissions have been directly affected to the transition from conventional vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). In fact, the electrification of transportation system and the growing demand of EVs have prompted recent researchers to investigate the optimal location of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). However, there are numerous challenges would face when implementing EVs at large scale. For instance, underdeveloped EVCSs infrastructure, optimal EVCS locations, and charge scheduling in EVCSs. In addition, the most fundamental EV questions, such as EV cost and range, could be partly answered only by a well-developed EVCS infrastructure. According to the literature, the researchers have been followed different types of approaches, objective functions, constraints for problem formulation. Moreover, according to the approaches, objective functions, constraints, EV load modeling, uncertainty, vehicle to grid strategy, integration of distributed generation, charging types, optimization techniques, and sensitivity analysis are reviewed for the recent research articles. Furthermore, optimization techniques for optimal solution are also reviewed in this article. In addition, the EV load impact on the distribution network, environmental impacts and economic impact are discussed.At present, the limited existence of fossil fuels and the environmental issues over greenhouse gas emissions have been directly affected to the transition from conventional vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs).

        <p>Over the recent decade, the demand on Electrical Vehicles (EVs) have been accelerate significantly due to the rapid decrease in CO 2 emissions (Parker et al., 2021) and the operating costs compared to the internal combustion engines(ICE) (Zhou et al., 2021). According to research, EVs could reduce CO 2 emissions by 28% by 2030(Adnan et al., 2018)). However, there are two prime challenges which could affect to the general community when transferring to EVs, such as the high cost of EVs and the lack of charging facilities. The different industries and governments over the world is expected to reach the EVs market to USD 974,102.5 million by 2027 growing at a healthy compound annual growth rate in the forecast period of 2020 to 2027 (Electric vehicle, 2020). One of the most critical issues addressed by the authors in this study is the lack of infrastructure for charging EVs. The number of EVs are exponentially increasing worldwide, posing a new challenge to the distribution network infrastructure and distribution network operators (DNO). In fact, excessive electrical power requirements due to EVs integration, bus voltages, power loss, stability, harmonic distortion, voltage mismatch, and power efficiency could be negatively affected to the distribution network. Furthermore, the more addition of EVs require more reliable electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) systems with less EV charging time. As a result, fast charging in the EVCSs is viable for charging an EV's battery in 20-30 min Zeb et al. (2020). Beside from the drawbacks of fast charging in the EVCS, it has detrimental effects on the distribution system that could be mitigated by accurate EVCS planning (Steen and Tuan, 2017).Over the recent decade, the demand on Electrical Vehicles (EVs) have been accelerate significantly due to the rapid decrease in CO 2 emissions (Parker et al., 2021) and the operating costs compared to the internal combustion engines(ICE) (Zhou et al., 2021).

        <p>In addition, the optimal location of EVCSs and the impact of EVs load on the distribution system have become more prominent research topics (Lam et al., 2014) in the last decade. Therefore, the DNO approach, EVs users approach, and EVCS owner approach are reviewed for the placement of EVCS in this paper by the authors. Specially, several researches have already been published on the positioning of EVCSs by the DNO approach such as minimizing bus voltage, minimizing total power loss, and maximizing the reliability of the distribution system. The other researchers have found the EVCS investor approaches for the EVCS placement, while limited number of researches have considered the EV user's strategy for the EVCS placement.In addition, the optimal location of EVCSs and the impact of EVs load on the distribution system have become more prominent research topics (Lam et al., 2014) in the last decade.

        <p>As the name implies, genetic algorithms (GA) mimic the genetic aspect of candidate populations to improve existing set selection. To apply a GA to a problem, careful design choices must be created to adapt the algorithm to the problem. In fact, the ability of the algorithm to find the right result is directly influenced by the gene-encoding system, its cross-over process, and fitness functions. A large pool of diverse data is also needed to ensure that the algorithm does not get stuck in local minima. This is usually accomplished by selecting genes for a crossover at random, which results in a slower convergence rate while ensuring exploration. When increasing the population size improves the solution of the GA, it also dramatically increases the computation time, even if the improvement in the solution is minor. In Xiang et al.

        <p>There are two basic approaches for multi-objective optimization techniques: a posteriori vs a priori. In a priori approach, multi-objective optimization problem is changed to a singleobjective one by aggregating the objectives. Further, a set of weights specifies how significant the objectives are and how often given by a problem domain expert. However, one of the primary disadvantages of such approaches is that an algorithm must be run multiple times to identify the Pareto optimum set. Furthermore, expert consultation is required, and some particular Pareto optimum fronts cannot be identified by this method (Mirjalili et al., 2017).There are two basic approaches for multi-objective optimization techniques: a posteriori vs a priori.

        <p>Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is an efficient meta-heuristic multi-objective genetic algorithm that is commonly deployed to solve multi-objective optimization problems in applications such as facility distribution, supply network architecture, and congested facility location. The NSGA-II divides the population into several non-dominated chromosome fronts, where every set's chromosomes are ranked according to their diversity. In addition, the multi-objective function is formulated by considering EVCS development cost, cost of specific energy consumption of EVs, electrical network power loss cost, DER power generation cost and maximum voltage deviation for placement of EVCS and DER in the distribution network and solved by NSGA-II (Battapothula et al., 2019b).Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is an efficient meta-heuristic multi-objective genetic algorithm that is commonly deployed to solve multi-objective optimization problems in applications such as facility distribution, supply network architecture, and congested facility location.

        <p>Colliding bodies optimization (CBO) is a population-based evolutionary method that mimics the rules of object collision (Kaveh and Mahdavi, 2014). The CBO has investigated positive results for a wide range of constrained and unconstrained benchmark functions, as well as engineering single-objective problems. This algorithm formulation is simple as it consumes no memory and requires no parameter tuning. Recently, a simplified multi-objective CBO (Kaveh and Mahdavi, 2019) technique based on non-dominated sorting was developed for optimizing the building material prices of reinforced concrete structural components and carbon dioxide emissions.Colliding bodies optimization (CBO) is a population-based evolutionary method that mimics the rules of object collision (Kaveh and Mahdavi, 2014).

        <p>A new meta-heuristic multi-objective ant lion optimization (MOALO) algorithm proposed by Mirjalili et al. (2017) to solve the multi-objective problem.

        <p>The current distribution system faces numerous problems as EV charging infrastructure expands. In recent years, these issues have been carefully assessed. EV impact analysis is primarily defined in the current literature to assess the effects of EVs on electricity generation adequacy, transformer aging, and distribution system power efficiency. In fact, it is possible that EV charging during peak load hours would increase peak load demand, requiring the expansion of generation capability. Furthermore, increased EV load demand would overload substation and service transformers, shortening their lifespan. Moreover, EV charging can cause voltage drops, power unbalances, and voltage/current harmonics, among other power quality issues.The current distribution system faces numerous problems as EV charging infrastructure expands.

        <p>Impact on the power quality of the distribution system. Power quality refers to a power grid network's ability to provide a reliable and clean power supply with a sinusoidal waveform and noisefree voltage and current harmonics. In particular, harmonics and voltage sag/swelling are two typical power quality issues. When connecting to the grid, EV chargers are the components that cause these issues. According to IEEE standard 519, the total harmonics distortion (THD) value for up to 69 kV power networks should be less than 5% to preserve power quality. According to this study, the harmonic disturbances would be higher when the EV chargers are connected to the grid and distribution network. The THD is around 4.82 percent for single EVs attached to the device, 12.35 percent for three EVs, and 19.69 percent for five EVs with different configurations (Karmaker et al., 2019;Ahmed et al., 2021).Impact on the power quality of the distribution system.

        <p>Impact on the voltage. This section discusses the effects of PEV integration on voltage change, which affects the efficiency of the power delivered to consumers. When EV load is added to the existing distribution system, the voltage drop at buses is related to charging. With regards to literature, in certain places, the voltage drop reported is less than 96 percent of the nominal voltage. As a result, system enhancements are required. In [73], various charging rates show a voltage deviation of 12.7 percent to 43.3 percent from rated voltage with 20 percent and 80 percent PEV penetration (Deb et al., 2018).Impact on the voltage.

        <p>Impact on power loss. When considering the future demand generated by gradual PEV grid integration, power system losses become a major concern. According to Ref. Dharmakeerthi et al. (2011), energy losses in off-peak charging could increase by up to 40 percent, for 62 percent of PEV market penetration. According to the researchers, network power losses increased significantly as PEV penetration is increasing (Deb et al., 2018). The increment of power loss could be minimized up to certain limits by applying the optimal location of EVCS process.Impact on power loss.

        <p>Impact on the reliability of distribution network. The reliability analysis of the distribution network has been a challenging area of research in recent years. Specifically, the distribution network's reliability indices are calculated by statistical data on failure rate, repair rate, average outage duration, and the number of consumers (Deb et al., 2020). Furthermore, the bus reliability index is a metric used to assess the reliability and vulnerability of each distribution network bus. In fact, the stability of the entire distribution network is measured by system reliability indices. Customer and energy-oriented reliability indices are subsets of system reliability indices. Customer-oriented reliability indexes are primly named SAIFI, SAIDI, and CAIDI. SAIFI is defined as the number of times a system customer experiences interruption during a particular period, while the average interruption period per customer served is specified by SAIDI. In addition, SAIDI depends on the duration of the failure as well as the number of customers (Deb et al., 2018).Impact on the reliability of distribution network.

        <p>Benefit of V2G scheme. The V2G deployment of EVCSs has several advantages, including lower costs for EV users, lower costs for EVCS operators, and smoother EVCS load curves. In fact, the key contribution of the V2G scheme is the transferring of vehicle battery energy to the grid at peak hours and the charging of the battery at off-peak hours. Further, the revenue generated by V2G power is determined by the form of electricity demand to which sold demand. For markets that only pay for electricity, such as peak power, revenue is the product of price and energy dispatched. In addition, V2G capacity would provide a portion of peak power, reducing the grid's requirement to purchase electricity on the wholesale market. As a result, cost savings could be formulated in Moradijoz et al. (2013) by providing loads of V2G power rather than purchasing power from the wholesale market.Benefit of V2G scheme.

        <p>Easy handling of renewable generation. Due to the intermittency of renewable energy generation, power providers are dealing with difficulties when integrating huge amounts of renewable energy supplies into their grids. However, the EV charger's fastresponding control electronic interface, together with the battery storage, reveals a practical solution for source intermittency. The study's most positive customer is that when EV participated in primary frequency control, the system was capable of handling wind integration up to 59 percent of total grid generation ability. On the other hand, it is possible to utilize certain solar energy for charging the EV. Moreover, it measures the energy requirements of a mid-sized sport utility vehicle based on a regular driving range of 40 miles, which is common in North America. In addition, the energy demand for all-electric mode driving and frequent charging is estimated to be 15-17 kWh. With respect to the normal average solar radiation year-round in Alberta, Canada, the derived panel sizes are 20 m 2 and 78 m 2 for the best and worst day solar radiation, respectively.Easy handling of renewable generation.

        <p>Instead of using gasoline based on conventional technology, the power demand of EVCS for EVs is served by a distribution network, which limits carbon emissions. Moreover, the large-scale integration of green energy systems to charge an EV battery world further reduce pollutant emissions. Generally, all-electric cars emit an average of 4450 pounds of CO 2 equivalent each year as well-to-wheel emissions are also considered (Chen et al., 2021a). On the other hand, conventional diesel engines could emit more than twice as much annually. In addition, the amount of well-towheel pollution your EV produces is primarily determined by the location and the most widely used energy sources for electricity.Instead of using gasoline based on conventional technology, the power demand of EVCS for EVs is served by a distribution network, which limits carbon emissions.

        <p>The economic impacts of EVs could be seen from two perspectives: the EV owner and the utility provider. In particular, the cost of an EV is also high as compared to an ICE vehicle. On the other hand, because of the higher efficiency of electric motors, EVs consume less fuel and low maintenance costs than ICE vehicles. In addition, the average ICE vehicle's efficiency ranges from 15% to 18%, while the efficiency of EV fluctuates from 60% to 70%. The EV owner would benefit from the V2G concept if it transfers the battery's stored energy to the distribution network. According to research (Dharmakeerthi et al., 2011), EV fleets will save fundamental power system costs between USD 200-300 per vehicle per year.The economic impacts of EVs could be seen from two perspectives: the EV owner and the utility provider.
