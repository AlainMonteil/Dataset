        <p>areas such as quantum optical computing, optical spintronics, biomedicine and high efficiency displays. Direct emission of CP light from organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has been a focus of research as it has the immediate application of increasing efficiency and simplifying device architecture in OLED based displays. High dissymmetry (g EL ) factor values have been reported for devices employing fluorescent polymers, but these CP-OLEDs are limited in their ultimate efficiencies by the type of emissive electronic transitions involved. In contrast, phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) can emit light from triplet excited states and can therefore achieve very high efficiencies. However, CP-PHOLEDs are significantly understudied and the two previous reports suffered from very low brightness or g EL values. Here, we use a platinahelicene complex to construct a CP-PHOLED that achieves both a display level brightness and a high g EL factor. The dissymmetry of CP emission reached with this proof-ofconcept single-layer helicene-based device is sufficient to provide real-world benefits over non-polarized emission, and paves the way towards chiral metal complex-based CP-PHOLED displays.areas such as quantum optical computing, optical spintronics, biomedicine and high efficiency displays.

        <p>Circularly polarized (CP) luminescence [1][2][3] is of interest in quantum computing, 4 optical communication for spintronics, 5 bioresponsive imaging, 6 asymmetric synthesis, 7,8 threedimensional displays, 9 and more efficient LCD 10 and OLED 11 screens. Currently, CP light is often produced from nonpolarized light through the use of filters, which lead to a loss in brightness, and, in the case of light emitting devices, to more complex and bulky device architecture. 12 Instead, it would be desirable to have organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) that can directly emit CP light.Circularly polarized (CP) luminescence [1][2][3] is of interest in quantum computing, 4 optical communication for spintronics, 5 bioresponsive imaging, 6 asymmetric synthesis, 7,8 threedimensional displays, 9 and more efficient LCD 10 and OLED 11 screens.

The maximum dissymmetry factor |g EL | of 0.38 reported here is sufficient to afford a 19 % increased bright-ness compared to non-polarized OLEDs of comparable efficiency in a display using a common circular polarization anti-glare filter (see SI for a detailed explanation and a definition of the CP-light convention). Several approaches exist for the production of OLEDs that directly emit circularly polarized light (CP-OLEDs, see Figure 1). Until 2013, most examples 13 were based on the use of polymers and oligomers bearing chiral side chains. 14 OLEDs based on these chiral organic semiconducting materials can reach impressive |g EL | factors of up to 0.35, 15 but their usage often involves complicated device fabrication (such as the use of alignment layers). Instead, our groups employed an operationally simpler approach, whereby a non-emissive, chiral helicene 16,17 dopant was blended with a standard nonchiral polyfluorene-based polymer, which induced CP electroluminescence from the polymer with a |g EL | factor of 0.2..

        <p>To the best of our knowledge, there are only two previous attempts at using chiral, non-racemic organometallic complexes as phosphorescent dopants in a CP-PHOLED. In the first study, the Di Bari group reported that an emissive chiral europium complex dopant in a non-emissive semiconducting polymer possesses narrow emission bands with remarkable |g EL | factors of 0.09-0.15 and 0.73-0.79 but a very low total luminance of less than 3 cd/m 2 . 29 In an alternative approach, a small series of iridium complexes with octahedral and point chirality were found to possess very low |g EL | factors of up to 0.0026. 30 Based on the high dissymmetry factors achieved using non-emissive helicene dopants, 18 we hoped that metal complexes featuring helical chirality could combine bright phosphorescence with significantly improved |g EL | values. While many different transition metal complexes with helicene ligands have been reported, 31 we focused on the group of platinahelicene complexes developed by the groups of Crassous, Autschbach, and RÃ©au, due to their structural similarity to common platinum phosphors and their excellent chiroptical characterization.

The enantiopure helicene complex displayed a notably improved solubility compared to racemic (Â±)-1. 46 Thus, the OXD-7:PVK ratio could be increased from 50:50 without resulting in the phase separation observed for racemic (Â±)-1.
