        <p>Neurons and synapses in the brain are the smallest unit of learning and memory. As shown in Fig. 1(a), a synapse is the nanogap ($3.5 nm) that connects two neurons, which can receive and process massive presynaptic inputs to determine the postsynaptic outputs. 5 The synaptic weight (W), i.e., the connection strength between neurons, depends on the concentrations of ionic species (e.g., Ca 2þ , Na þ , and K þ ) upon presynaptic action potentials (APs), which modulate the release of neurotransmitters. The synaptic weight permits the coupling between neurons, conveying electrical or chemical signals and influencing the spiking behavior of neighboring neurons, giving thus rise to the neuronal development. Changes in synaptic strength are known as synaptic plasticity. In neurology, synaptic plasticity is activity dependent at either or both sides of the synapse. 6 Generally, synaptic plasticity can be classified into short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP), respectively. STP corresponds to the transient modification of synaptic strength after stimulation, which lasts for tens of milliseconds to a few minutes, while LTP is a persistent modification of synaptic strength, which can last from hours to years. In biological systems, STP is required for short-term memory (STM) and allows synapses to perform critical computational functions in neural circuits such as transmission, encoding, and filtering of neuronal signals. 7 However, LTP is obviously needed for storing the processed information, i.e., the long-term memory (LTM), and is thought to underpin learning and memory. 8 STP can be converted to LTP after sufficient training or persistent neuronal activities. A putative neuronal mechanism of learning and memory is Hebbian synaptic plasticity, i.e., the synaptic strength between the pre-and postsynaptic neurons depends on the time-correlation of their activity. 9,10 Two classic paradigms for the induction of Hebbian plasticity is spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and spike-rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP). 11 STDP is the refinement of the Hebbian rule, where the synaptic modification relies on the relative timing of activity between the pre-and postsynaptic neurons. 12 STDP is considered to be the main learning and memory mechanism of the brain and also forms the basis for autonomous, unsupervised learning in neuromorphic computing. 13 SRDP is another widely observed learning rule, which reflects the influence of the activity frequency of presynaptic inputs on synaptic modification. 14 Hardware implementation of synaptic functionalities using microelectronic devices is regarded as the footstone for neuromorphic engineering. Multiple and nonvolatile conductance levels of electronic devices are needed to mimic the basic functions of synaptic plasticity. Presently, there are two possible ways of synapse realization: the traditional silicon hardware and the emerging memory devices. The main advantage of the former is the matureness of silicon and its full integration with the standard CMOS technology. Mead et al. coined the term "neuromorphic" in the 1980s and proposed the concept of a single transistor learning synapse in 1995. 15,16 The silicon approach relies on charge-based mechanisms as in conventional flash memory and random access memory (RAM), such as static and dynamic RAM (SRAM and DRAM). Several MOS transistors are usually needed to build a silicon neuron. 17 With the development of semiconductor manufacturing technologies over the past two decades, nonbiomimetic CMOS chips have been the advanced electronic implementation of neuron circuitry. Brain-like circuits are now commercially available, by integrating billions of transistors on a square centimeter. [18][19][20] However, the need for high speed and design complexity for CMOS architectures complicate the path to achieve the interconnectivity, information density, and energy efficiency of the brain. Unlike the "0" and "1"-based digital transistors that make up modern computer chips, alternative analog devices with nonlinear transmission characteristics and slow ion motions are closer to the biophysical properties of neurons and synapses. In addition, analog computing without using analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog (ADC/DAC) conversion is not only energy efficient but has great potential in a mixed-signal neural network. 21 Although the appropriate candidates for artificial synapses and neurons is still under debate, tunable memory devices including two-terminal memristors and three-terminal neuromorphic transistors are promising. 3,22 The operation principles of these devices are based on coupled ionic-electronic features. 23 The original definition for memristor ("memory resistor") was predicted from symmetry arguments by Chua in 1971. 24 In 1976, Chua et al. generalized the memristor concept to a much broader class of nonlinear dynamical systems they called memristive systems. 25 In 2008, Strukov et al. correlated the resistive switching devices with memristors, in which memresistance was experimentally observed in Pt/TiO x /Pt memories. 26,27 The resistance of the devices depends on the history of current that has flowed through it under an external bias voltage. Note that the roots of resistive switching phenomena date back to the 1960s, 28,29 while resistive switching devices were proposed as a new generation of nonvolatile memories even before the experimental evidence of memristors. 30 The pinched hysteresis loop has been identified as the fingerprint of memristive systems, 31,32 thereby unifying a broad class of two-terminal nonvolatile memories as memristors. These devices include resistive switching RAM (RRAM), [33][34][35] magnetic RAM (MRAM), 36 and phase-change memory (PCM). 37 Over the last decade, memristors were intended for applications in data storage, logic circuits, and neuromorphic computing. In particular, for neuromorphic applications, abrupt switching that is present in conventional binary memristors (i.e., digital-type memories) is unfavorable, and analog memory phenomena are desirable for the training of neural networks with high accuracy/speed. 38,39 The gradual switching can be engineered by redox reactions (e.g., electrochemical metallization, and valence change), 40 the current-induced Joule heating effect, 41 the spintransfer torque effect, 42 and even ferroelectric polarization. 43 For the redox-based resistive switching memristors that are coupled by ionic and electronic transport dynamics, aspects such as electrolyte materials, 44,45 electrode activity, 46 filament nucleation, 47,48 and ambient 49 have been extensively studied to achieve controllable switching characteristics. Nowadays, memristors have attracted great interest for single synaptic units with high scalability (&lt;2 nm), 3D integration capability, and fast switching speed ($nanosecond). 50 Large area arrays of memristors could be easily integrated in a crossbar architecture to perform vector-matrix multiplication directly utilizing Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's law. 21 Complex computational tasks and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been implemented with such post-CMOS device arrays. [51][52][53] On the other hand, neuromorphic transistors could provide an alternative platform for synaptic electronics because of their structural nature, with physically separated input and output terminals. [54][55][56] Hysteresis in the transfer curves of transistors with gradually changed conductance presents a history-dependent memory behavior. Hence, the synaptic weight (i.e., channel conductance, G) can be precisely controlled in a tightly coupled fashion between the control terminal (gate electrode) and the transduction terminals (source-drain electrodes). Meanwhile, the training or "write" operation is on the gate that is spatially separated from the signal transmission or the "read" process on the channel. This endows synaptic circuits with concurrent actualization of inference and learning, hence facilitating the implementation of more complex neuromorphic functions. 57 Besides, the write current (i.e., gate current) could be much lower than the read current (drain current) so that this three-terminal configuration results in improved state retention and energy efficiency. 58 From the mechanism perspective, neuromorphic transistors are desirable for the decoupling of STP and LTP through the use of different functional regions and physical mechanisms, [59][60][61] thus being a naturally suitable medium in which STP and LTP can be induced concomitantly and expressed independently. 62 From other performance and functionality viewpoints, neuromorphic transistors offer advantages of multimodal control (e.g., electrical, optical, mechanical stimuli, and physicochemical responses such as gas and ion/molecular sensing [63][64][65][66] ), thereby allowing the implementation of artificial synapses that mimic biological sensory (afferent) and motor (efferent) neurons. 67,68 Among all kinds of neuromorphic transistors, electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs), in which the semiconducting channel is in contact with a gate electrode via an electrolyte [Fig. 1(b)], have shown to be very promising for the implementation of artificial synapses. The electrolyte is an ionic conductor but an electronic insulator dielectric. 69 An electrolyte could be either in a liquid or a solid state, having ions (anions and cations) displaced in opposite charges at the electrolyte/ electrode interfaces in response to an electric field. Typically, two major categories of EGTs have been employed for synaptic electronics depending on the permeability of the semiconductor channel to the ions of the electrolyte. Specifically, the impermeable one is the electrolyte-gated field-effect transistor (EG-FET) with the channel current modulated by the gate voltage via a capacitive field-effect mechanism at the channel/electrolyte interface. Due to the ultrathin "electrical double layers" (EDLs, $1.0 nm) formed at the gate/electrolyte and electrolyte/semiconductor interfaces, EG-FET is often known as electrical double layer transistors (EDLTs). The other type is called an electrochemical transistor (ECT), which is based on electrochemical doping/dedoping processes upon the bulk injection of ionic species to the redox-active channel material. Previously, EGTs have been widely used in chemical and biological sensing, which was enabled by their high transconductance and compatibility with aqueous solutions and biological systems. [70][71][72] The interest in EGTs dramatically increased in recent years after being associated with the concept of neuromorphic transistors. Compared to dielectric thickness-dependent field-effect transistors (FETs, nF/cm 2 ), EGTs employ a high parallel plate capacitance ($1-10 lF/cm 2 ) and/or volumetric capacitance ($370 F/cm 3 or $500 lF/cm 2 equivalent capacitance/unit area) to realize the high coupling efficiency of the gate to the channel. 73 This feature endows synaptic EGTs with the ability to alter conductance at ultralow voltages ($millivolt), leading to an attractive alternative in energyefficient neuromorphic circuits. 74 Moreover, coupled and tunable ionic and electronic conductances make EGTs valuable for electronic synapses [Fig. 1(c)] since their operation mode approaches the biological counterparts when compared to other technologies. For these reasons, EGTs can be exploited for the realization of electronic prostheses to directly interface with living neurons that have signals of low amplitude. 75 Another benefit of the synaptic EGTs is their structural flexibility in constructing the synaptic networks. A shared electrolyte would be an interesting feature to provide a global control mechanism (oneinput to multioutputs). 76 On the other hand, an electrolyte is particularly suitable for the lateral-gated transistor configuration [Fig. 1(d)], enabling multi-inputs to one-output. 77 In this regard and given the specific characteristics of EGTs (e.g., ion/electron interaction, high specific capacitance, physiological environmental compatibility, and architectural flexibility), a unique opportunity arises to explore these devices as candidates for neuromorphic building blocks with new and unconventional form factors [Fig. 1(e)]. 22,68,78 In this review, the recent advances in EGT-based synaptic electronics, from a single device to neural networks, are comprehensively summarized and discussed. A brief theoretical background of static and transient characteristics for EGTs is introduced in Sec. II. In Sec. III, recent developments of synaptic responses and artificial perception neurons are reviewed based on the electrolyte gating of metal oxides, organic materials, and 2D materials. Finally, challenges and perspectives for future research of synaptic electronics and neuromorphic systems based on electrolyte-gated transistors are discussed in Sec.

        <p>There are different approaches to implement coupled ionic and electronic conductivities in artificial synapses to emulate the biological synaptic functionality. The concept of using electrolytes in contact with semiconducting materials is not a new one. It dates back in the '50s when researchers at Bell labs were experimenting with germanium electrodes interfacing the aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide, potassium chloride, and hydrochloric acid. 81 These experiments showed that electrolytes can be efficiently used to modulate the semiconductor surface potential, validating the idea that they can also be employed for transistor gating. The motivation behind that was to take advantage of the large capacitance electrolytes can deliver, which allows for extremely low operation voltages. In this part, as a case study, we mainly focus on organic electrolyte-gated transistors, and specifically, we are going to present their basic operation mechanism and provide the main equations that govern their steady state and transient response. To achieve this, we categorize electrolyte-gated transistors in two major classes. 82 The first one includes transistors the semiconducting film of which is impermeable to the electrolyte ions [Fig. 2(a)], while in the second class, these ions can penetrate the semiconductor, changing its redox state [Fig. 2(b)].There are different approaches to implement coupled ionic and electronic conductivities in artificial synapses to emulate the biological synaptic functionality.

        <p>In the impermeable mode of operation, an applied gate voltage forces ions to migrate to and pile up at the gate/electrolyte and electrolyte/semiconductor interfaces. These ions screen charges at the gate and accumulate (or deplete) carriers in the semiconducting film. As a result, EDLs are formed at both interfaces, which can be considered as capacitors with a Debye screening length k at the nanometric scale. In this case, the thickness of the dielectric is reduced to an interface level, resulting in a high parallel plate capacitance. The specific capacitance of these nanocapacitors can be estimated to 10 lF/cm 2 , a value significantly larger than the typical 0.1 lF/cm 2 achieved by solid-state dielectric capacitors. 82,83 It is also worth noticing that for these devices, the applied gate potential drops predominantly at the formed double layer capacitors, while the voltage remains constant in the bulk of the (electrically neutral) electrolyte. The above fact implies that the operation of an impermeable EDL transistor can be considered an extreme case of a FET.In the impermeable mode of operation, an applied gate voltage forces ions to migrate to and pile up at the gate/electrolyte and electrolyte/semiconductor interfaces.

        <p>For the permeable mode, the electrolyte ions can penetrate the semiconductor film, thereby modulating its conductivity, a process called electrochemical reaction. The EDL at the gate/electrolyte interface in this case may or may not be formed depending on the gate material employed (polarizable or nonpolarizable gate electrodes). Transistors that work in this configuration are called electrochemical transistors (ECTs), and the redox is a reversible process taking advantage of the entire volume of the conducting film and delivering large volumetric capacitance values. 86 As a result, small changes in gate biases result in large modulations in drain current, which is the reason for ECTs to operate as efficient switches and powerful amplifiers. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) often employ a conducting polymer that is electrochemically active and ion permeable.

PEDOT:PSS can undergo an oxidation/reduction reaction and switch between the conducting (oxidized) PEDOT þ and the insulating (neutral) PEDOT o electrochemical states. The PSS chain is hydrophilic and ion permeable. Applying a positive bias at the gate leads to the injection of cations into the polymer blend [Fig. 2(d)]. Therefore, the positive bias at the gate leads to the diffusion of cations into the PSS structure and the compensation of the sulfonic acid groups of PSS. At the same time, PEDOT charge carriers (polarons and bipolarons) hop between PEDOT regions through p-p stacking. This mechanism thus provides both ionic and electrical conductivities in the channel. The charge neutrality of the PEDOT:PSS layer implies a reduction in the number of holes in the polymer, which is similar to electrochemically dedoping. These excess holes are extracted at the drain electrode, and since the drain current is proportional to the quantity of mobile holes in the channel, it probes the doping state of the organic polymer. 73 The steady state current in a device like that is given by a formula that bares similarities to (1)For the permeable mode, the electrolyte ions can penetrate the semiconductor film, thereby modulating its conductivity, a process called electrochemical reaction.

For synaptic plasticity, there are two forms of synaptic responses, namely, potentiation and depression, which are linked to the strengthening and weakening of synaptic transmission, respectively. 118 For STP, short-term potentiation (STPo) and short-term depression (STD) in synapses act as high/ low-pass filtering that plays a significant role in the information processing of auditory and visual system. 119 STP in the form of amplitude encoding is also believed to enhance the bandwidth of neurons whenever saturation in their rate code is reached. 120 For LTP, it is now clear that long-term potentiation (LTPo) and long-term depression (LTD) are used for multiple brain functions in addition to learning and memory, as it contributes to the neuronal development. 121,122 Fundamental synaptic plasticity behaviors have been successfully mimicked in electrolyte-gated synaptic transistors, such as excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic current (EPSC/IPSC), paired pulse facilitation/depression (PPF/PPD), and high/low-pass filtering effects, and spike-timingdependent plasticity (STDP).Synaptic plasticity, i.e., the ability of synapses to modulate the coupling between the pre-and the postsynaptic neurons, leads to the dynamic development of the neuronal network.

        <p>The electrostatic coupling effect has been widely used to mimic the STP functions in dense semiconductor-based EDLTs. 123 Chen et al. reported on a carbon nanotube (CNT) channel synapse with a hydrogen-doped poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) electrolyte. 105,124 When the presynaptic spike was low and short (5 V, 1 ms), the dynamic change of postsynaptic current (PSC, channel current) was induced by the hydrogen ion accumulation at the electrolyte/channel interface, which in turn modified the electron concentration in the CNT channel. 83 Such an interfacial EDL electrostatic modulation process was reversible when the gate voltage was removed, representing the temporal analog phenomenon in biological synapses. The CNT synaptic device showed dynamic signal processing and learning functions with an extremely low energy of $7.5 pJ/spike. In contrast to the two-terminal memristive devices in which the energy consumption is mainly contributed by the write operation, the read energy of synaptic EGT is comparable or larger than the write energy because the gate leakage current is generally much lower than the channel current, and thus, the energy efficiency is read limited. 101,125 The overall energy consumption scales with the channel area. 74 Channel materials with inherently low conductivity are more suitable to construct energy-efficient synaptic EGTs. 58 The STP functions based on the electrochemical doping concept were initially demonstrated by Gkoupidenis et al. in PEDOT:PSS based organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) gated with an aqueous KCl electrolyte (0.1 M). 109 In this depletion-mode transistor, synaptic functions were reproduced by applying positive presynaptic voltage pulses (V Pre ) at the gate electrode (with amplitude V P , width t P , period T P , and time interval between the pulses Dt ¼ T P À t P ). Cations (K þ ) were injected from the electrolyte to the soft PEDOT:PSS blend, resulting in the compensation of the sulfonic acid groups of PSS and the charge neutrality of the PEDOT:PSS layer. This electrochemically dedoping lost mobile holes in PEDOT:PSS and thereby induced an inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC). After removing the pulse, the injected cations relax to the electrolyte, and the PEDOT:PSS layer was reversibly doped to its initial highconductance state, showing a typical short-term depression behavior. The PPD behavior was mimicked by applying a pair of pulses at the gate electrode [Fig. 3(a)]. The depression percentage decreased with the increasing time interval Dt. High frequency presynaptic stimuli were heavily suppressed, enabling the depressive PEDOT:PSS OECT to serve as a low-pass filter that impedes supernumerary bursts of presynaptic pulses. Frequency-dependent high-or low-pass filtering could be realized in a single device depending on the patterns of presynaptic activity. 126,127 For example, Ling et al. reported an identical spikepolarity method to mimic the concomitance of excitatory and inhibitory short-term plasticities in a PEDOT:PSS OECT. 126 Owing to the distinctive volumetric capacitance (C Ã ) and rapid electrochemical doping process ($0.4 ms) of OECTs, the dynamical reconfiguration between the excitatory and inhibitory responses with 10 mV stimulus resolution and multilevel synaptic strength was realized by controlling the doping degree of PEDOT:PSS, without preforming operations or introducing additional modulation terminals. High frequency input signals (50 Hz) could induce a strong suppression/potentiation effect to filter out the corresponding low/high frequency input signal, and thus, both low-pass/high-pass filtering functions can be implanted in a single synaptic device by modulating the synapse operation modes.The electrostatic coupling effect has been widely used to mimic the STP functions in dense semiconductor-based EDLTs. 123 Chen et al. reported on a carbon nanotube (CNT) channel synapse with a hydrogen-doped poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) electrolyte. 105,124 When the presynaptic spike was low and short (5 V, 1 ms), the dynamic change of postsynaptic current (PSC, channel current) was induced by the hydrogen ion accumulation at the electrolyte/channel interface, which in turn modified the electron concentration in the CNT channel. 83 Such an interfacial EDL electrostatic modulation process was reversible when the gate voltage was removed, representing the temporal analog phenomenon in biological synapses.

        <p>An enormous effort has been made in understanding the mechanism that underlies learning and memory. 128 Learning may be described as the mechanism by which new information about the world is acquired and memory as the mechanism by which that knowledge is retained. At the cellular level, it has been revealed that long-term potentiation consists of distinct phases involving different molecular mechanisms. 129 The storage of long-term memory is associated with gene expression, de novo protein synthesis, and formation of new synaptic connections. 8 At the device level, ion penetration into the channel is the identifying characteristic of OECTs, resulting in an operation mechanism that is distinctly different from EDLTs. Given the inherent reversibility of ion injection/extraction in/from the loose bulk of the channel volume, the implementation of long-term memory properties in conjugated polymer-based OECTs is still challenging. Generally, the nonvolatile conductance tuning was obtained in synaptic OECTs by modulating the electronic structure of channel materials. 58,130,131 Gkoupidenis et al. used a poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTHF)-based PEDOT derivative (PEDOT:PTHF) as the OECT channel gated with an aqueous KCl electrolyte (0.1 M). 132 When a high reduction potential was applied, the polymer structure PEDOT:PTHF underwent a structural collapse and an opposite polarity oxidation potential was required for the reversal of this conformational change. 133 As a result, the PEDOT:PTHF OECTs exhibited a nonvolatile phenomenon and could operate either in the STM or LTM regime, depending on the number of training pulses [Fig. 3(b)]. The amplitude of PSCs persisted a permanent increase in synaptic efficacy after the repetitive stimulation, resulting in long-term phenomena.

However, the LTPo and LTD properties were attained by electropolymerization and electrochemical overoxidation of the channel material under 30 V G spikes of À0.5 V and À2 V (1s), respectively.

        <p>The STM to LTM transition has been extensively studied in EDLTs and can be accomplished by modifying the ionic gating effects from ideal electrostatic coupling (surface accumulation and without interfacial electrochemical processes) to electrochemical reactions (ion intercalation) through higher V P and/or longer t P gate presynaptic spikes [Fig. 3(c)]. 61,102,103,134 Xu et al. reported organic core-sheath nanowire artificial synapses that were gated with an ion gel composed of a poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate-block-styrene) (PS-PMMA-PS) triblock copolymer and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl) imide [EMIM] þ [TFSI] À ionic liquid [Fig. 3(d)]. 108 The p-type poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) core was printed and wrapped with a polyethylene oxide (PEO) sheath. The nanowire printing technique could precisely define the channel length down to 300 nm, ensuring that the synaptic device has a low energy consumption down to %1.2 fJ per spike. When the synaptic transistor was stimulated by 30 presynaptic spikes (À1 V or 1 V, 50 ms), the anions/ cations that accumulating near the nanowire would penetrate into the P3HT core through the PEO sheath and gradually increased/decreased the charge carrier density in the channel. Due to the PEO sheath, the spontaneous release of the trapped ions in the P3HT nanowire was slow, and this restricted mobility induced LTP or LTD. As shown in Fig. 3(e), the organic nanowire-based synaptic transistor operated in an analog fashion with gradual but nonlinear conductance changes. However, a large range of linearly and symmetrically programmable conductance states are required to avoid complex programming schemes in large arrays and to facilitate near-ideal training and inference accuracy in neural network simulations. 131,135 In this regard, Yang et al. reported a polymer electrolyte PEO:LiClO 4 gated synaptic transistor based on 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered WSe 2 that could biorealistically emulate both STP and LTP. 103 As shown in Fig. 3(f), the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization supported that when a gate pulse (5 V, 50 ms) was applied, the Li þ ions were adsorbed to the surface of the 2D materials. Ions diffused back into the ion gel after the removal of the gate bias, leading to the STP property. In contrast, when the Li þ ions got intercalated into the vdW material after the application of 100 gate pulses (5 V, 50 ms), they could not be liberated spontaneously after removing the gate bias, and hence, backward diffusion of the ions was retarded, leading to the LTP behavior. Because the STP property was dominated by surface adsorption, the short-term synaptic response was related to the effective area of the vdW channel, whereas it was insensitive to the layer number of the vdW material. The long-term synaptic activity could be effectively manipulated by tailoring the diffusion dynamics by varying thicknesses and structures of the vdW materials, producing LTP and LTD functionalities with enhanced linearity, symmetry, and reproducibility. Ge et al. reported concomitant STP and LTP behaviors using the insulator-metal transition mechanism in an n-type tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) synaptic transistor, which was gated with an ionic liquid of 61 When a positive V G (0.6 V, 70 ms) was applied, DEME þ ions accumulated at the ionic liquid (IL)/channel interfaces to form EDLs and induced additional electrons in the channel. Once V G was removed, cations and anions in the ILs relaxed and mixed together in short time, leading to volatile phenomena. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, transmission spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) clarified that when V G (1.8 V, 210 ms) was higher than the threshold value of the hydrolysis reaction (V T ), the trace water molecules contained in the ILs could dissociate into protons (H þ ) and hydroxyls, both of which had smaller ion sizes and relatively high chemical reactivity. 102 The protons then penetrated into the WO 3 channel, resulting in the formation of a stable metallic H x WO 3 phase and the nonvolatile resistance state. The synaptic potentiation and depression could be reproduced by consecutive positive (1.8 V, 210 ms) and negative spikes (À1 V, 210 ms), respectively. A typical asymmetric STDP was obtained in this WO 3 synaptic transistor, which was induced by temporal correlations of pre-and postsynaptic spikes [Fig. 3(g)].The STM to LTM transition has been extensively studied in EDLTs and can be accomplished by modifying the ionic gating effects from ideal electrostatic coupling (surface accumulation and without interfacial electrochemical processes) to electrochemical reactions (ion intercalation) through higher V P and/or longer t P gate presynaptic spikes [Fig. 3(c)]. 61,102,103,134 Xu et al. reported organic core-sheath nanowire artificial synapses that were gated with an ion gel composed of a poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate-block-styrene) (PS-PMMA-PS) triblock copolymer and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl) imide [EMIM] þ [TFSI] À ionic liquid [Fig. 3(d)]. 108 The p-type poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) core was printed and wrapped with a polyethylene oxide (PEO) sheath.

Ge et al. reported concomitant STP and LTP behaviors using the insulator-metal transition mechanism in an n-type tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) synaptic transistor, which was gated with an ionic liquid of 61 When a positive V G (0.6 V, 70 ms) was applied, DEME þ ions accumulated at the ionic liquid (IL)/channel interfaces to form EDLs and induced additional electrons in the channel. Once V G was removed, cations and anions in the ILs relaxed and mixed together in short time, leading to volatile phenomena. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, transmission spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) clarified that when V G (1.8 V, 210 ms) was higher than the threshold value of the hydrolysis reaction (V T ), the trace water molecules contained in the ILs could dissociate into protons (H þ ) and hydroxyls, both of which had smaller ion sizes and relatively high chemical reactivity. 102 The protons then penetrated into the WO 3 channel, resulting in the formation of a stable metallic H x WO 3 phase and the nonvolatile resistance state. The synaptic potentiation and depression could be reproduced by consecutive positive (1.8 V, 210 ms) and negative spikes (À1 V, 210 ms), respectively. A typical asymmetric STDP was obtained in this WO 3 synaptic transistor, which was induced by temporal correlations of pre-and postsynaptic spikes [Fig. 3(g)].</p>
        <p>Various mechanisms have been adopted to implement the nonvolatility and modulate the functional regions from STP to LTP, such as electrostatic coupling, electrochemical doping/dedoping, charge trapping/detrapping, ferroelectric polarization, and phase transformation (electropolymerization, insulator-to-metal, semiconductor-tometal, and amorphous-to-crystalline). 60,61,98,136 Note that most of the reported LTP is based on large structural transformations in channels, resulting in high write noises and even irreversible electrochemical doping. 134 If operated in their subthreshold regime (e.g., with the use of low amplitude and/or narrow width input pulses), the nonvolatile transistors can practically only show STM dynamics without affecting the LTM. However, nonvolatile neuromorphic devices with writeerase ability and structural stability are highly desired. For example, Fuller et al. reported an all solid-state, nonvolatile electrochemical transistor. In this device, a negative gate voltage induced the intercalation of Li þ dopants into the channel of Li 1Àx CoO 2 . 137 The channel then undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition with nearly six orders of magnitude increase in electronic conductivity. A positive gate voltage could reintercalate Li þ and return the channel to its initial conductivity. This process was highly reversible and without large structural transformations. In a device based on the conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS, a similar LTP behavior was demonstrated. 58 In this example, the device resembles an electrochemical battery, where ionic charges (protons) can move through the electrolyte that separates the two organic electrodes, while electronic charges move through the electronic circuit. This results in enhanced state stability and analog tuning. To further enhance the state and cycle stability, smart material design and the definition of the number of separable states have to be taken into account. 130 Hebbian plasticity alone through potentiation and depression is expected to be insufficient to explain activity-dependent development because it tends to destabilize the activity of neural circuits (i.e., higher temporal correlation between pre-and postsynaptic signals leads to a higher coupling between neurons, with no upper limit). 138 Homeostatic plasticity is another important function that is believed to stabilize the neuronal activity that was induced by the positivefeedback nature of Hebbian plasticity. 139 Homeostatic plasticity mechanisms include global changes in synaptic strengths and changes in neuronal excitability. Due to the fact that biological neural networks are immersed in a common electrolyte environment, global factors of this environment are forcing specific normalization functions that regulate the overall network behavior. 139 Gating OECTs with electrolytes offers a straightforward way to emulate homeostatic regulation, a phenomenon that is not easily accessible with other solid-state technologies. 76,140,141 Gkoupidenis et al. demonstrated the global control of a whole array of PEDOT:PSS-based OECTs that were immersed in a 0.1 M NaCl electrolyte [Fig. 3(h)]. The weights of these individual artificial synapses could be modulated globally by the voltage applied on the electrolyte and by its ion concentration, in the way that was analogous to homeostasis. The synchronization of I/O transmission could be reproduced in this system [Fig. 3(i)]. Additionally, the electrolyte established soft connections between individual devices (grids) without hard connectivity (i.e., physical wiring). It was also shown that the output (O i ) of these grids could be synchronized by a global oscillatory input despite the fact that individual local inputs (I i ) were stochastic and independent. 141 The synchronization effect was more pronounced at its amplitude extrema and high frequency of the global oscillatory input. This global temporal coupling resembled well the phase locking of neurons to brain oscillations, leading to a functional type of connectivity found in brain oscillations (i.e., binding through synchrony).Various mechanisms have been adopted to implement the nonvolatility and modulate the functional regions from STP to LTP, such as electrostatic coupling, electrochemical doping/dedoping, charge trapping/detrapping, ferroelectric polarization, and phase transformation (electropolymerization, insulator-to-metal, semiconductor-tometal, and amorphous-to-crystalline). 60,61,98,136 Note that most of the reported LTP is based on large structural transformations in channels, resulting in high write noises and even irreversible electrochemical doping. 134 If operated in their subthreshold regime (e.g., with the use of low amplitude and/or narrow width input pulses), the nonvolatile transistors can practically only show STM dynamics without affecting the LTM.

        <p>In recent years, flexible, wearable, and implantable electronics are attracting increasing interest for healthcare and biomedical applications. 142 In addition, the use of biocompatible and biodegradable materials in electronic devices can be an important trend in the development of green electronics. 143 Compared with metal-oxide semiconductors, biofriendly conjugated polymers (CPs) as channel materials of EGTs have received growing attention in flexible neuromorphic platforms for their advantages such as chemical tunability, low cost, mechanical flexibility, and compatibility with printing and rollto-roll processes. 144 Conjugated polymers can not only transport ions but also transport holes (p-type; popular examples include PEDOT:PSS, 145,146 PANI, 113 P3HT, 147,148 and poly(2 149,150 ) or electrons [n-type, such as p(gNDI-gT2), 151 P-90, 152 and poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) 153 ]. The simulation of synaptic functions in organic EGTs has extended the functionality into E-skins, artificial afferent nerve, etc., which highly benefits from the mixed conductivity and biocompatibility features of conjugated polymers. 144,154,155 Biocompatible and biodegradable electrolyte materials are also highly recommended for green electronics since the electrolyte is the integral part of an EGT. Electrolyte materials consist of ionic liquids (ILs), 61,156 ion-gels, 92,157,158 polyelectrolytes, 159 polymer electrolytes, 100,103,160 aqueous salts [e.g., NaCl, KCl, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution], and even water. 161 Among them, proton-rich biopolymers are attracting growing interest for solid-state electrolytes of green and flexible synaptic transistors since the transport of protons is found in many natural phenomena such as muscle contraction, taste receptor cells, and mammalian brain. 162,163 Typical biopolymer electrolytes that have been used include polysaccharides (chitosan, [164][165][166][167] sodium alginate, 168 pectin, 169 and starch 170 ), cellulose (lignin 114 ), and proteins (albumin 171 ). Shi et al. used chicken albumen as the electrolyte film in n-type IZO-based synaptic EGTs. 171 According to the leakage and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements [Fig. 4(a)], the hydrated albumen film was an electron insulating but ionic conducting electrolyte with a maximum leakage current density of 5 Â 10 À7 A/cm 2 at À0.02 MV/cm and a high proton conductivity (r) of $3.7 Â 10 À4 S/cm. The ionic conductivity was mainly attributed to the migration of protons induced by the amino acid interaction with H 2 O. Protons could move along the hydrogen-bond network following the Grotthuss mechanism. Thus, it was necessary to maintain a certain water content for the fabrication and characterization of the biopolymer electrolyte-based synaptic transistors. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the specific capacitance increased with the decreasing frequency and reached the maximum value (&gt;1.0 lF/cm 2 ) at 1.0 Hz due to the formation of huge interface EDL capacitance. Note that at a higher voltage level of &gt;2.0 V and a frequency of &lt;10 Hz [Fig. 4(c)], the mobile protons penetrated across the albumen/IZO interface and reacted with IZO, resulting in surface hydrogenation and an increase in nonvolatile IZO conductance. For the biodegradable electronics, Guo et al. reported a starch-based electrolyte for indium-tin-oxide (ITO) synaptic EGTs. 170 Starch is an environmentally friendly and naturally abundant polymeric carbohydrate. During the gelatinization process, water molecules are bound to the starch chain network. The proton conductivity (r) of the $14 lm thick starch film was estimated to be $2.6 Â 10 À3 S/cm. The proton related EDL capacitance was $1.6 lF/cm 2 at 1 Hz. Both short-term and long-term synaptic plasticities were mimicked under voltage spikes of 0.5 V (10 ms) and 4 V (600 ms), respectively. Due to the water solubility of the starch film, the devices could easily be dissolved in DI water after soaking for 60 s [Fig. 4(d)].In recent years, flexible, wearable, and implantable electronics are attracting increasing interest for healthcare and biomedical applications. 142 In addition, the use of biocompatible and biodegradable materials in electronic devices can be an important trend in the development of green electronics. 143 Compared with metal-oxide semiconductors, biofriendly conjugated polymers (CPs) as channel materials of EGTs have received growing attention in flexible neuromorphic platforms for their advantages such as chemical tunability, low cost, mechanical flexibility, and compatibility with printing and rollto-roll processes. 144 Conjugated polymers can not only transport ions but also transport holes (p-type; popular examples include PEDOT:PSS, 145,146 PANI, 113 P3HT, 147,148 and poly(2 149,150 ) or electrons [n-type, such as p(gNDI-gT2), 151 P-90, 152 and poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) 153 ].

        <p>In addition to the nontoxicity and biodegradability, biopolymerbased electrolyte films have the advantage of being active flexible substrates in forming or conforming to complicated textures and shapes. 172 Liu et al. reported a freestanding chitosan membrane to act as both the electrolyte and the flexible substrate in the IZO EGTs. 164 The 100 lm chitosan membrane was able to form transparent pinhole-free conformal coatings with a surface strain (e) of 0.5% at 10 mm bending radius. Since the chitosan membrane is a threedimensional proton conductor, when a positive presynaptic spike was applied on the in-plane gate, protons were driven laterally and accumulated at the chitosan/IZO channel interface [Fig. 4(e)]. The drain current was increased due to the accumulated electrons by the proton/ electron electrostatic coupling effect. Figure 4(f) shows the paired pulse facilitation (PPF) behavior as a function of the interval between two successive presynaptic spikes (1.5 V and 50 ms) for the freestanding synaptic transistor. The PPF ratio decreased gradually with increasing Dt, and a maximum PPF value of %222% was obtained at Dt ¼ 10 ms. The distance between the laterally coupled gate electrodes and the channel layer was shown to play a key role in the operation frequency. For example, the PPF value decreased much slower with a larger gateto-channel distance due to the fact that longer diffusion time was needed for the protons to relax back to the balanced state in the case of a larger migration distance. 173 Due to the lateral coupling property, the freestanding solid-state electrolyte has been proven suitable for coplanar-gated transistors to emulate temporal summation functions. 165 As can be seen in Fig. 4(g), the obtained EPSC was asymmetrical with respect to the time interval between the temporally correlated spikes from two separate gate inputs. Huang et al. reported the use of wood-derived cellulose nanopapers (WCNs) as a freestanding electrolyte in C8-BTBT-based synaptic transistors [Fig. 4(h)]. 114 The as-fabricated 30 lm WCNs were composed of densely packed nanosized fibers with around 1 nm roughness [Fig. 4(i)]. This smooth active substrate exhibited high transparency (close to 90%) in the visible-light region. Freestanding WCNs were rich in hydrogen bonds and thus able to absorb moisture from the air and thus introduce protons into WCNs. The active film exhibited an ionic conductivity of 7.3 Â 10 À3 S/cm and a high laterally coupled effective capacitance of 18.65 nF/cm 2 at 30 Hz. The spatial summation function was reproduced in the C8-BTBT synaptic transistors with dual coplanar-gates, which showed a sublinear integration. The lateral effective capacitance and the dendritic integration effect were tuned by controlling the distance of the in-plane gates. A high-pass filtering effect was also simulated in Fig. 4(j), and the increase in the presynaptic spike frequency would induce a strong EPSC amplitude increase.In addition to the nontoxicity and biodegradability, biopolymerbased electrolyte films have the advantage of being active flexible substrates in forming or conforming to complicated textures and shapes. 172 Liu et al. reported a freestanding chitosan membrane to act as both the electrolyte and the flexible substrate in the IZO EGTs. 164 The 100 lm chitosan membrane was able to form transparent pinhole-free conformal coatings with a surface strain (e) of 0.5% at 10 mm bending radius.

        <p>In the brain, information processing is spatiotemporal. The ability of the human brain to convert input information from multipathways into specific output patterns is important for learning, memory, executing event-driven behaviors, and enabling parallel computations. 174 Dendritic integration plays an important role in information transformation including the addition of nonsimultaneous unitary events (temporal summation) and addition of unitary events occurring simultaneously in separate regions of the dendrite (spatial summation). 175 An electrolyte shows frequency sensitivity and bulk ion conductivity, enabling the laterally gated transistor configuration in which both the gate electrodes and a source-drain channel are patterned concurrently in one plane, decreasing fabrication complexity.

        <p>Orientation selectivity is a broadly investigated phenomenon in the primary visual cortex. 181,182 Gkoupidenis et al. demonstrated this function in a PEDOT:PSS-based OECT array with 3 Â 3 coplanar Au gate electrodes [Fig. 5(a)]. 77 An enhanced current response I 0 (i.e., PSC amplitude) was obvious for the gates that are closer to the drain electrode, which was attributed to the decrease in the electrolyte resistance (R E ) for smaller gate-drain electrode distances (d). Similar to the current response I 0 , inhomogeneity toward the drain electrode was also evident in the relaxation time (t R ) mapping. The closest to the drain, gate electrode (x ¼ 1, y ¼ 1) resulted in the lowest t R value. This spatial inhomogeneity in PSC could thus be used for implementing the orientation selectivity function. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the variable orientation could be created by superimposing eight gate pulses at gate electrode 0 and another gate electrode x (x¼ 1 À 6), simultaneously. 111 The spatial orientations of the input pulse were defined by the angle range from 0 to 180 . Figure 5(c) shows the polar diagram of the EPSCs for different spatial orientations of the input pulse for this iongel gated P3HT synaptic transistor. The average peak EPSC was gradually increased with the orientation angle changed from 0 to 50.2 or from 180 to 129.8 , which was similar to the orientation tuning curve in the primary visual cortex. The maximum tuning response (2.22 lA) was obtained at the orientation angle of 129.8 , for gate electrode 5 that was the closest to the drain electrode. Neurons in the primary visual cortex respond preferentially to edges with a particular orientation. Inspired by this, a neuromorphic system with a combination of photodetectors and a multigated synaptic transistors was further developed to mimic the edge recognition function. 161,176,179 As shown in Fig. 5(d), 161 a square panel with five pairs of black-white grating patterns was moved along the y axis in the yoz plane. The orientation angle (h) was defined as the angle between the z axis and the grating orientation. The coordinate of the photodetector is (x, 0, 0), and the coordinate of the panel center was (0, y, 0). Each time the edge of the grating pattern moved across the coordinate origin, it was detected by the photodetector, and the processing circuit would provide a voltage pulse (0.5 V, 10 ms) to the presynaptic terminal of the aqueous solution gated n-type indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) synaptic transistor. Figure 5(e) shows that when the maximum value of EPSC was obtained at the orientation of 0 , ten presynaptic spikes induced by ten edges were triggered successively. Orientation selectivity was shown to be dependent on the ionic conductance of the aqueous electrolyte. Besides, the alcohol solution gated synaptic transistor demonstrated the highest degree of orientation selectivity since the delivery of hydronium and hydroxyl ions was inhibited (facilitated) by alcohol molecules (salt ions). An individual multigate neuromorphic transistor has also been used for object detection. Wan et al. designed a visual system for emulating the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD) neuron. 177 The system was constructed by a 20 Â 20 photoreceptor array connecting to the multiple in-plane gate arrays of the IZO neuromorphic transistor in a one-to-one correspondence [Fig. 5(f)]. Proton conducting graphene oxide (GO) electrolytes were fabricated on graphene/poly(ethyleneterepthalate) (PET) substrates. Both of the square object and the photoreceptor array were parallel to the xoy plane with the center coordinates of (0, 0, z o ) and (0, 0, z a ), respectively. The gray dashed box denotes the image of the object in the photoreceptor array, and the edge movement thus could be detected by comparing the difference between the successive images. The excitatory stimuli (0.5 V, 1.0 ms) were triggered and then sent to the corresponding presynaptic terminals (gates) of the neuromorphic transistor once the object edge was detected by using a photoreceptor. Three object approaching modes (toward, away, and parallel) to the photodetector array were then distinguished according to the EPSC dynamics.Orientation selectivity is a broadly investigated phenomenon in the primary visual cortex. 181,182 Gkoupidenis et al. demonstrated this function in a PEDOT:PSS-based OECT array with 3 Â 3 coplanar Au gate electrodes [Fig. 5(a)]. 77 An enhanced current response I 0 (i.e., PSC amplitude) was obvious for the gates that are closer to the drain electrode, which was attributed to the decrease in the electrolyte resistance (R E ) for smaller gate-drain electrode distances (d).

The gray dashed box denotes the image of the object in the photoreceptor array, and the edge movement thus could be detected by comparing the difference between the successive images. The excitatory stimuli (0.5 V, 1.0 ms) were triggered and then sent to the corresponding presynaptic terminals (gates) of the neuromorphic transistor once the object edge was detected by using a photoreceptor. Three object approaching modes (toward, away, and parallel) to the photodetector array were then distinguished according to the EPSC dynamics.</p>
        <p>The computing functions in the neural network are based on synaptic integrations. The spatial summation has been leveraged to reproduce Boolean logic operations. As shown in Fig. 5(g), two types of logic "AND" and "YES V2 " were constructed, respectively, by changing the applied gate voltage drop across the channel that was controlled by the area of gate electrodes. The input 10 ms voltages of 0 and 1.0 V were defined as 0 and 1, respectively. The integrated EPSC amplitude was defined as the output, and the threshold value was set to 750 nA. For the same electrode area, the EPSC amplitude was larger than the threshold line only when input signals were "11," which indicated the AND logic. When the area of G 2 was %2.5-fold larger than that of G 1 , the capacitance of the G2-electrolyte interface would be larger to induce the efficient EDL gating. As long as input V 2 is 1, the output EPSC amplitude was larger than the threshold value, which indicated the YES V2 logic. Besides, the "OR" logic, synaptic weight regulation, and coincidence detection could be achieved by introducing a modulatory terminal (G m ), and thus, the network functionalities can been enriched. 110,164 The spatial summation effect was also demonstrated with two spatial isolated presynaptic inputs in GO-coupled synaptic transistors [Fig. 5(h)]. 179 When the input spikes were first triggered individually and then simultaneously on two in-plane gates (G 1 and G 2 ), the three EPSCs can be obtained. The red and blue curves were the EPSCs (A 1 , A 2 ) triggered by single presynaptic spikes (V 1 and V 2 ) ranged from 0.2 to 1.4 V on G 1 and G 2 , respectively. The expected sum (S E , green dashed curves) was defined as the arithmetic sum of two individual EPSC responses (A 1 þ A 2 ), and the measured sum (S M , black curves) was the EPSC stimulated by the two simultaneously triggered spikes. Summation would be expected to range from sublinear to superlinear depending on the stimulus intensity of the individual excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP). Figure 5(i) shows that such spatial summation was nearly linear for low spike voltages. A linear summation model has been postulated to facilitate coincidence detection by cortical neurons. 183 Strong superlinear for intermediate spike voltages and sublinear for high spike voltages were necessary for the exponential function and logarithmic function, respectively. 184 The nature and geometry of the gate electrode can be regarded as a key factor for designing the initial synaptic weight distribution in the electrolyte-gated neuromorphic system. For example, classical conditioning according to the Pavlovian associative learning rule has been implemented in a multiterminal P3HT synaptic transistor. 180 The topology of multi-inputs to one-output was mapped with lateral gates through solid-state ion-gel consisting of poly(vinylidenefluoridecohexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-co-HFP) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMI] þ [TFSA] À ) ionic liquid [Fig. 5(j)]. Based on protonic electrochemical doping/dedoping processes at P3HT/ion gel interfaces, four types of STDP learning behaviors of Hebbian STDP, anti-Hebbian STDP, symmetrical STDP, and visual STDP were successfully mimicked on a single neuromorphic transistor. The classical conditioning was demonstrated as shown in Fig. 5(k), and four À3 V pulse signals (t p ¼ 50 ms and Dt ¼ 50 ms) were applied to the G 2 electrode to simulate the unconditioned stimulus of "bell ringing," which induced a smaller change in the synaptic weight value (DW peak ) compared to the defined threshold (45 lA, green dotted line), corresponding to the absence of salivary response. When four À5 V pulse signals (t p ¼ 50 ms and Dt ¼ 50 ms) were applied to the G 1 electrode to simulate the conditioned stimulus of "sight of food," a DW peak value larger than the threshold was triggered, which corresponds to the salivary response. Then, four À3 and À5 V input signals were applied simultaneously to the G 1 and G 2 electrodes to simulate the training process. After training, a salivary response could be produced even with four À3 V pulse signals (bell ringing) due to the nonvolatile feature. Therefore, an effective link between the input signals applied to the G1 and G2 electrodes was established, demonstrating that dynamic processes of memorizing were incorporated into the gate matrix simulation.The computing functions in the neural network are based on synaptic integrations.

        <p>Shang et al. reported the simulation of handwritten digit recognition using a 2D layered a-phase molybdenum oxide (a-MoO 3 )-based synaptic EGT array gated by a PEO:LiClO 4 electrolyte [Fig. 6(d)]. 101 Voltage pulses with higher amplitudes (&gt;62 V) or long duration times (10 ms) induced the reversible intercalation of Li þ dopants into the a-MoO 3 lattice, forming molybdenum bronze (Li x MoO 3 ) and leading to a nonvolatile DG. By alternatively applying 50 identical pulses (62.5 V, 10 ms) with 10 s interval, bidirectional analog switching was obtained, where the near-linear channel conductance was set to numerous states between 42 and 75 nS in both the LTP and LTD processes. This low conductance was promising for the application of neuromorphic networks composed of large-scale device arrays. The minimum energy consumption value for a nonvolatile DG was 1.8 pJ for a single pulse (2.5 V, 10 ms) event with the channel length of %10 lm. The calculated asymmetric ratio (AR) value of the synaptic transistor was as small as 0.31 6 0.12 [the inset in Fig. 6(f)]. The cycleto-cycle variation, i.e., write noise, was &lt;12% in 15 a-MoO 3 EGT nanosheets with the channel thickness of 16.8-28.0 nm, indicating good device-to-device uniformity.

With the assistance of a light pulse, a larger conductance change ratio (G max /G min ) without the degradation of the nonlinearity property was obtained and the recognition rate of MNIST training patterns was improved from 49% to 62% with 100 weight states. To further improve the recognition accuracy, more conductance states and a higher ratio of G max /G min were required through adjusting the gate pulse duration and/or amplitude but without sacrificing the linearity. A promising solution is to improve the ion capacity of the channel materials and the conductance sensitivity to doping. The nonlinear potential drop between the series resistance also affects the linearity. 58 Emelyanov et al. demonstrated experimentally a double hidden layered ANN to solve a nonlinearly separable task (implementation of an XOR logic gate). 197 In their synaptic EGTs, HCl p-doped PANI was used as the channel materials and interfaced with a PEO:LiClO 4 solid electrolyte. In the simulation, every decision boundary was performed by one neuron in the two hidden layers, and the points inside the triangle-like class corresponded to class 1, while the others corresponded to class 0. The double hidden layers allowed the perceptron to classify not only "black" (logic 0) and "white" (1) classes but also "gray" ones (some range of signal amplitude between logics 0 and 1). The possible position of decision boundaries between classes could be well defined after the learning procedure. The ability of artificial neurons to classify the "exclusive or" (XOR) logic function is a basic demonstration of the nonlinear separable task. Fuller et al. experimentally implemented this function into a 3 Â 3 ionic floating-gate memory array (IFG). 74 The memory array was based on a PEDOT:PSS EGT connected to a selector device of two-terminal volatile conductive-bridge memory (CBM). This CBM permitted the individual addressing of redox transistors in a crossbar configuration (at the circuit level, not the physical crossbar configuration). Determined by the competition between write gate voltage (V W ) and the ON threshold V th of the CBM, electron injection (extraction) through the CBM into the top PEDOT:PSS gate results in the reversible electrochemical oxidation (reduction) of the bottom PEDOT:PSS channel, 58 thereby increasing (decreasing) G. The redox transistors operated similar to a flash memory but with more than an order of magnitude lower voltage operation and weight readout &lt;10 nA while maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, the devices showed finely spaced conductance levels with nearideal analog behavior [Fig. 6(g)].

        <p>A synapse is a biological structure, which connects two neurons enabling specific and unidirectional information flow (excitation or inhibition) from one neuron to another. In this regard, Erokhin et al. demonstrated this functional interface between two living neurons in rat brain slices via a PANI-based synaptic EGT [Fig. 7(d)]. 75 Initially, APs evoked by suprathreshold depolarizing current injection in either neuron failed to evoke any response in another cell of the pair, indicating that this pair of cells was not connected by natural synapses in either direction. The two neurons were then connected through an electronic circuit with a PANI synaptic EGT to play the role of a synapse analog. As the resistance of the PANI channel reduced upon depolarization, the consecutive depolarizing steps and the APs in "presynaptic" cell 1 induced a gradual increase in voltage responses from the PANI EGT [Fig. 7(e), plot 3] and in "postsynaptic" cell 2 (plot 4). When the depolarizing response in cell 2 reached the AP threshold (%À40 mV) at sweep #113 (plot 4), cell 2 started to reliably fire APs. Moreover, the PANI synapses efficiently supported synchronized delta-oscillations in this two-neuron network. As a result, the unidirectional, activity-dependent coupling of living neurons through an organic synaptic EGT was realized. For further perspective of implantable prosthetic synapses, one must fulfill requirements such as size scaling, biocompatibility, flexibility, and stretchability of the artificial synapse.A synapse is a biological structure, which connects two neurons enabling specific and unidirectional information flow (excitation or inhibition) from one neuron to another.

        <p>Neuromorphic EGTs are physical computing nodes that can directly interface with analog signals from sensors, enabling the efficient construction of artificial sensory systems with integrated sensing/actuation and signal processing functionalities. Since skin is the largest organ of the human body, which contains a variety of sensors, it offers the ability to perceive and interact with the surrounding environment. 154,200 Zang et al. reported a dual-organic-transistor-based tactile-perception system (DOT-TPE) with integrated sensing and neuron-like information-processing functionalities of pressure stimuli [Fig. 8(a)]. 205 The proposed DOT-TPE consisted of both a pressuresensing organic field-effect transistor (OFET) and a signal-processing OFET using poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole-terthiophene) (PDPP3T) as 207 This synaptic transistor was actuated by a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) that functioned as the tactile sensor to realize the self-powered tactile synapse. The self-powered synaptic system was able to realize AND and OR logic functions and Pavlovian conditioning. The biomimetic functionality of tactile perception systems, combined with their promising features of flexibility and large-area fabrication, represents a step forward for pressure-sensory synapses towards novel E-skins for neuromorphic sensing and actuation.Neuromorphic EGTs are physical computing nodes that can directly interface with analog signals from sensors, enabling the efficient construction of artificial sensory systems with integrated sensing/actuation and signal processing functionalities.

        <p>Photostimulated synapses using light as the input signals not only combine visual perception, information processing, and memory together but also provide advantages such as higher bandwidth, robustness, and potential for parallelism, which is suitable for simulating retinal neurons. [208][209][210] The transduction of the color and intensity of the incident light into neural signals is a main process for visual perception. Guo et al. reported a ferroelectric/electrochemical modulated organic synaptic EGT for an ultraflexible, artificial visual-perception system [Fig. 8(e)]. 136 A p-type copolymer poly(isoindigo-co-bithiophene) [P(IID-BT)] was used as the channel material, and bilayered poly(vinylidenefluoride-cotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] and poly[(1-vinylpyrrolidone)-co-(2-ethyldimethylammonioethyl methacrylate ethyl sulfate)] [P(VP-EDMAEMAES)] acted as the polyelectrolytes. Besides the fundamental STP/LTP operations by electrochemical doping, the large EDL capacitance allowed P(VDF-TrFE)'s polarization switching, to achieve an extra ferroelectric LTP function with reliable nonvolatility. This synaptic EGT was integrated with an organic light-sensitive electronic component to construct an artificial visualperception system. This light sensory system displayed an incident light intensity and frequency dependent electrochemical LTP to ferroelectric LTP transition. A 5 Â 6 pixel array was demonstrated to allow for color recognition by converting photons from different wavelengths with identical intensity (10.80 mW/cm 2 ) into volatile (850 nm, 64 Hz) and nonvolatile (550 nm, 64 Hz) synaptic signals, respectively [Fig. 8(f)]. The wavelength-recognition functionality characterized by signal's degree of nonvolatility was attributed to the higher-energy green light-triggered extra ferroelectric LTP compared to the electrochemical only LTP with near infrared (NIR) irradiation. Lee et al. reported an optoelectronic sensorimotor synapse based on a stretchable organic nanowire synaptic transistor (s-ONWST), integrated with a photodetector and a neuromuscular system [Fig. 8(g)]. 107 The ion gel-gated fused thiophene diketopyrrolopyrrole (FT4-DPP)-based synaptic EGT was built onto a 100% prestrained styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) rubbery substrate to introduce the stretchability. Each visible light pulse induced an output presynaptic voltage of À1.1 V from the organic photodetector to drive the s-ONWST. Spike duration and number-dependent plasticity were similar in the stretchable s-ONWST at 100% strain to those in the device at 0% strain. The optoelectronic sensorimotor system was then used for optical wireless communication. The International Morse code was coded in the form of patterns of visible light to trigger the postsynaptic potentiation of the s-ONWST, and every letter of the English alphabet was decoded according to the sum of EPSC amplitude peak values. Photoelectric neuromorphic devices are promising for the development of nextgeneration human-machine interface applications, soft robotics, neurorobotics, and electronic prostheses. 211,212 IV. SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES Overall, electrolyte-gated transistors are promising candidates for synaptic electronics and neuromorphic computing owing to their mixed ionic/electronic transduction, physiological environmental compatibility, mechanical/architectural flexibility, and in particular low energy consumption. Basic synaptic functions have been successfully mimicked. Unique functions arising from the inherent properties of electrolyte-gated devices are also demonstrated, including global regulation phenomena, coplanar coupling, and integration with freestanding active substrates and with living neurons, among other examples. A variety of complex tasks, such as dendritic integration, classic conditioning, pattern recognition, and sensory function, are realized in EGT-based arrays and circuits.Photostimulated synapses using light as the input signals not only combine visual perception, information processing, and memory together but also provide advantages such as higher bandwidth, robustness, and potential for parallelism, which is suitable for simulating retinal neurons.

        <p>First, a more profound insight should be obtained into the ion transport/trapping related device physics to ensure stable and reliable neuromorphic functionalities. The most fundamental synaptic behaviors of STP and LTP are selectively induced by controlling the degree of device volatility through hybrid mechanisms. The LTP behavior suffers in many cases from challenges in large structural transformations of channel materials and/or parasitic oxidation reactions, leading to performance degradation. Novel channel materials and gating mechanisms are highly desired to maintain electronic structures for the implementation of LTP functions. Next to the simulated synaptic behavior, additional metrics should be systematically reported to evaluate the reconfiguration ability, device stability and (cycling) lifetime, and endurance.First, a more profound insight should be obtained into the ion transport/trapping related device physics to ensure stable and reliable neuromorphic functionalities.

        <p>An increase in the write-read speed and a decrease in energy consumption are needed to be able to build neuromorphic networks. The operation speed of EGTs is mainly limited to $kilohertz (millisecond), with the exception of a few examples, by the ion drift and diffusion in the gate electrolyte and/or the channel. Selecting gate electrolytes and channel materials with high ion mobility to shorten the ion migration time are currently suggested. The speed could also be increased by scaling down device dimensions, especially by reducing the channel and electrolyte thickness to shorten the ion diffusion distance. When the device is scaled down to sub-100 nm scale, it is possible to increase the switching speed to $megahertz (microsecond), which can also decrease the power consumption to the subfemtojoule level for a single spike event. Furthermore, internal ion-gated electrochemical transistors, with ions that are preloaded on the channel, have shown faster operation speeds, but their applicability in the neuromorphic device configuration should be further investigated. 213 Vertical configurations of transistors can also further reduce ion diffusion time, compared with a planar geometry.An increase in the write-read speed and a decrease in energy consumption are needed to be able to build neuromorphic networks.

        <p>Moreover, the high-density integrated circuits (ICs) of synaptic EGTs suffer from device-to-device uniformity (e.g., device noise, nonlinearity, and asymmetry) and environmental dependence (e.g., humidity &gt; 50%). In addition to the optimization of thin film preparation techniques, cumulative probability and related statistics of channel conductance change (DG) extracted from a large amount of experimental measurements should be considered to properly simulate device nonidealities. Another issue is the requirement of a liquid electrolyte and humidity ambience in some synaptic devices. From a technological point of view, liquid gates are difficult to scale below 100 nm dimensions or to integrate with the existing solid-state circuits. From an application point of view, solid electrolyte-based synaptic EGTs show that these platforms can be downscaled for space-efficient electronic devices, while studies performed with a liquid electrolyte show their potential applications for interfacing with biology, such as human/machine interaction through neuromorphic sensing/actuation, personalized healthcare, and artificial nerves and organs.Moreover, the high-density integrated circuits (ICs) of synaptic EGTs suffer from device-to-device uniformity (e.g., device noise, nonlinearity, and asymmetry) and environmental dependence (e.g., humidity &gt; 50%).
