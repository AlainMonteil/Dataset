        <p>Human-robot collaboration is a main technology of Industry 4.0 and is currently changing the shop floor of manufacturing companies. Collaborative robots are innovative industrial technologies introduced to help operators to perform manual activities in so called cyber-physical production systems and combine human inimitable abilities with smart machines strengths. Occupational health and safety criteria are of crucial importance in the implementation of collaborative robotics. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the state of the art for the design of safe and ergonomic collaborative robotic workcells. Emerging research fields beyond the state of the art are also of special interest. To achieve this goal this paper uses a systematic literature review methodology to review recent technical scientific bibliography and to identify current and future research fields. Main research themes addressed in the recent scientific literature regarding safety and ergonomics (or human factors) for industrial collaborative robotics were identified and categorized. The emerging research challenges and research fields were identified and analyzed based on the development of publications over time (annual growth).</p>
        <p>The current evolution in industry is commonly defined through the 'Industry 4.0′ concept [1]. Human-machine interaction (HMI), in particular human-robot collaboration (HRC), is a main cyber-physical and enabling technology of Industry 4.0 [2].</p>
        <p>HRC is one of the so called nine key technologies according to the widely used classification of Boston Consulting [68] together with: additive manufacturing, augmented reality, vertical and horizontal data integration, simulation, cyber security, industrial internet of things, big data analytics and cloud computing.</p>
        <p>Industrial collaborative robots are a category of robots that perform tasks in collaboration with workers in industrial settings [3]. In other words, collaborative robotics is introduced to help operators perform manual activities and allows a safe physical interaction (direct or mediated) between humans and machine systems. The final goal is to improve production systems performance and operators work conditions by matching typical machine strengths with human inimitable skills [4]. Collaborative systems can provide many advantages but also challenges in terms of physical human-robot interaction (HRI). In fact, ensuring safety and ergonomics (or human factors) of operators in a hybrid workspace during shared operations could be complex. Actually, a collaborative system is designed for interaction with a human within a defined collaborative workspace where the main hazard category will be of mechanical type. This is because it is possible to have potential not-functional (and unwanted) contacts between the human and the robot during the sharing of the workspace. While collaborative robots present some inherent safety measures which allow the implementation of safe applications, this state usually changes as soon as they are integrated into a working environment and equipped with different types of end-effectors. For this reason, safety systems for collision avoidance and/or contact mitigation as well as safety measures related to the workcell design must be adequately implemented.</p>
        <p>Ergonomics (or human factors) involves the psychophysical and social wellbeing of operators. From a physical point of view, collaborative robots can facilitate a reduction of biomechanical overload by supporting operators in heavy and repetitive tasks. On the other hand, a close collaboration could provide psychological stress to operators. In fact, operators' wellbeing and performances can suffer from the unknown robot behavior [5]. For this reason, even if cognitive ergonomics is a very novel and often underestimated theme in the field of industrial HRC, it is necessary to include these aspects into the design stages of collaborative workcells.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the current state of the art of safety as well as ergonomics (or human factors) in collaborative robotics and to identify those research fields which are of a high importance to bring collaborative robotics from the laboratory in the shop floor. Based on consolidated and well discussed themes in research, this work should identify where scientists should concentrate and focus in the near future to successfully implement collaborative workcells in industrial companies. Thus, this paper seeks to answer the following research questions: RQ1: Which are the main research themes that researchers addressed in the recent scientific literature regarding safety and ergonomics (or human factors) for collaborative robotics in industry? RQ2: What are the most emerging research challenges and research fields in safe and ergonomic collaborative robotics in industry?</p>
        <p>After an introduction of the theoretical background in Section 1, Section 2 is describing the methodology used in this work based on a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to identify relevant papers for this study. In Section 3 these papers are analyzed identifying sub-cluster of research fields. Section 4 is dedicated to discuss the findings from the content analysis and to provide an overview of emerging research fields and challenges for collaborative robotics in the context of safety and ergonomics (or human factors). Further in this section practical implications and limitations of this study are discussed. Section 5 summarizes the findings of this work and gives a brief outlook.</p>
        <p>According to main results, about two third (64.2%) of analyzed papers are related to safety and about one third (35.8%) of papers are related to ergonomics (or human factors). This means that in the recent period (2015-2018) researchers invested more effort in the development of the safety aspects instead to the study of the ergonomic conditions of HRI. Nevertheless, physical and cognitive ergonomics is growing significantly in the last two years. This condition underlines the necessity to focus future works in the alignment of safety and ergonomics (or human factors) research effort. According to the results and referring to safety works, there is a higher interest in prevention (which studies safety measures that aim to operate before potential human-robot contacts occur) instead in protection (which studies safety measures that aim to minimize the effects of human-robot contacts after the physical interaction occur).</p>
        <p>We applied SLR in this study because it is based on a systematic, method-driven and replicable approach [6]. SLR aims to search, appraise, synthetize and analyze all the studies relevant for a specific field of research [7]. According to [8], SLR is characterized by a scientific and transparent process that aims to minimize bias through exhaustive literature searches and by providing an audit trail of the reviewer's procedures.</p>
        <p>There are several studies on how to conduct a SLR (e.g. [7,[9][10]). In our research, we applied the SLR approach as suggested by [10]. Based on this reference, we defined the following four consecutive steps for our study:</p>
        <p>• Step 1: Establishing the research objectives of the SLR; • Step 2: Defining the conceptual boundaries of the research; • Step 3: Setting out the data collection by defining the inclusion/ exclusion criteria;</p>
        <p>• Step 4: Reporting the validation procedure and efforts.</p>
        <p>The objectives of this research were deduced from the research questions described in the introduction. In the SLR, we want to identify the main research themes that researchers addressed in recent scientific literature regarding safety and ergonomics (or human factors) for collaborative robotics for industrial use. The following content analysis in this SLR will help us to understand and investigate what are the most emerging research challenges and research fields in safe and ergonomic collaborative robotics. In particular, we want to understand how the results in research generated in the last years can be categorized, and where we have to concentrate in the future to successfully implement shared and collaborative workplaces in industry.</p>
        <p>This research aims to analyze collaborative robotics. Thus, the setting of the conceptual boundaries was based on the terms 'collaborative robotics' and its derivations combined with terms describing its application in an industrial environment (e.g. 'industrial', 'production', 'manufacturing' or 'assembly') and, of course, considering the terms 'safety' and 'ergonomics' or 'human factors' (for simplicity, we will name this main theme only 'ergonomics' in the rest of the article).</p>
        <p>In addition to the conceptual boundaries, several search criteria, in terms of database, search terms and publication period need to be defined. We used Scopus as electronic database for the keyword search, which we identified as being the most relevant for publications in the engineering and manufacturing area. A previous check of other sources such as ISI Web of Knowledge, Science Direct and Emerald did not show any major changes in relation to adding to the sources. Therefore, we decided to conduct the SLR with the Scopus database as it represents the most relevant source for our purpose.</p>
        <p>Fig. 1 shows the applied search approach and the inclusion and exclusion criteria in relation to the search query. In different steps we identified relevant papers for our study. In a first step we identified the literature of the collaborative robotics field using the following search terms for searching in title, abstract and keywords: 'collaborative robotics', 'collaborative robot', 'cobots', 'human robot', 'humanrobot' and 'human-robot'. In this first step all kind of subject areas and documents were included and only works in English language were selected. As we are interested to better understand the current state of the art and emerging research fields, we selected the last four full years as time span for this research (2015)(2016)(2017)(2018). According to Scopus data, the annual paper production related to this research is starting to grow significantly from 2015, which is the starting year of the analyzed period. As a result, we obtained 7589 papers.</p>
        <p>In a second step we concentrated on collaborative robotics in the industrial sector as robotic solutions e.g. in service industry or medicine are not in the scope of our study. Therefore, in this second step the following search terms were added through a Boolean "AND" function: 'industry', 'industrial', 'manufacturing', 'assembly' and 'production'. Through this filter in the second step we obtained 1372 relevant papers. To be sure, that important search terms were not taken into account we built a ranking of key words (Scopus keywords and author keywords) used by the identified works. The ranking list created in this way did not lead to the fact that further keywords had to be added to the search term.</p>
        <p>In a third step we wanted to concentrate our study on relevant research works in engineering or computer science. Therefore, the search was limited to 'Journal' as source type and 'Article', 'Review' and 'Article in Press' as document type to consider only high quality literature. To focus the study on areas related to the design of collaborative workplaces we further limited the search to the subject areas 'Engineering' and 'Computer Science'. As a result we obtained 363 relevant papers as basis for our study. We want to mention that there may be also industry-related publications where ergonomics is the core topic and that are published in non-technical journals. Therefore, some relevant works may not be considered focusing on the abovementioned subject areas.</p>
        <p>In a fourth step we divided the search results in two groups, one group for works talking about safety and the other group about ergonomics. Therefore, the abovementioned 363 works were further combined with a Boolean "AND" function with the following search terms: one group using the term 'safety' and a second group using the terms 'ergonomics', 'human factors' and 'human-factors'. 94 of the 363 papers are related to the first group while 24 of the 363 papers are related to the second group. A total of 9 papers is relevant to safety and to ergonomics as well; therefore these 9 papers are counted in both groups.</p>
        <p>The following procedure of validation of the search results to obtain a final list of relevant papers for our study is described in the next Section 3.4.</p>
        <p>The appropriateness of the identified literature references to the aims of the study is crucial for every SLR. Often, the search results treat the subject of the SLR study as only incidental or superficial. To ensure the appropriateness of the search results, we applied a relatively straightforward coding scheme which evaluated the appropriateness of a search result using a score of 1-2 (where 2 denotes high appropriateness and 1 denotes low appropriateness). The screening was carried out in two phases by three independent researchers. In the first phase, (1°round of screening) only the title and abstract were read. In the second phase (2°round of screening), the whole paper was examined. We calculated an inter-rater reliability for each paper by evaluating the difference in scoring. Where the three independent raters came to the same conclusion, i.e., zero differences or the highest interrater reliability, the papers were directly included into the analysis. Papers where differences in the coding occurred were discussed in order to result in 100% agreement between the three researchers.</p>
        <p>In the first round of screening, by reading the paper title and abstract, the number of papers related to safety reduced from 94 files to 71 files while for those related to ergonomics the papers reduced from 24 to 21.</p>
        <p>In the second round of screening, by reading the whole paper, the number of papers related to safety reduced from 81 to 46 files. The number of papers related to ergonomics reduced from 21 to 9 papers. According to papers content, an amount of 8 papers were moved from safety to ergonomics, 1 paper was moved from ergonomics to safety, 4 papers were moved from safety to safety and ergonomics and 2 papers were moved from ergonomics to safety and ergonomics. Appendix provides details of paper encoding and final classification.</p>
        <p>In total, we analyzed 118 papers (94 in safety plus 24 in ergonomics minus 9 works in both categories) of which 63 were scrapped due to the screening as described above. The following considerations and analysis are based on the finally obtained database of papers relevant for our study: total of 55 papers, 35 relevant only for safety, 14 relevant only for ergonomics and 6 relevant for both safety and ergonomics. Fig. 1. Search approach and inclusion/exclusion criteria.</p>
        <p>The following analysis is based on a primary content division in 'safety' and 'ergonomics'. For each main theme, a further cluster and related sub-cluster division is provided. This classification was adopted after carefully reading all identified works and categorizing all works. The identified clusters represent macro-categories, which summarize the top-level concepts discussed in the research papers. Sub-clusters identify successive partitions of a cluster and are used to specify more detailed subjects of the scientific literature. They also help to identify research themes that are of interest to all, only to some or only to a single cluster. The proposed categorization in clusters and sub-clusters as well as the relationship of a sub-cluster with a cluster is illustrated in Fig. 2.</p>
        <p>'Contact Avoidance' as well as 'Contact Detection and Mitigation' were identified as cluster 1 and 2 in the category regarding works on safety. For the works regarding ergonomics, 'Physical Ergonomics' as well as 'Cognitive and Organizational Ergonomics' have been defined as cluster 3 and 4. The following lower-level categorization into subcluster shows three main arguments, which could be assigned to all four identified clusters: 'Motion Planning and Control', 'Simulation and Modelling' as well the presentation of 'Case Studies and Applications'. The use of 'Assistance Systems' is discussed in research about Contact Avoidance (cluster 1) as well as physical and cognitive/organizational ergonomics (clusters 3 and 4). Methods for 'Safety Management' in collaborative workplaces are relevant for Contact Avoidance (cluster 1), contact detection/mitigation (cluster 2) as well as Physical Ergonomics (cluster 3). The development of 'Sensor Systems for Object Tracking' is an important research theme to avoid or detect/mitigate contacts or In the following subsections we report and summarize the main findings in the content analysis to argument the proposed categorization in Fig. 2 and to give the reader an overview of recent research activities and results in the shown clusters and sub-clusters.</p>

        <p>As shown in Fig. 7, 64.2% of identified papers are related to 'safety' and 35.8% to 'ergonomics'. This means that in the recent period (2015-2018) researchers invested more effort in the development of the safety aspects instead to the study of HRI ergonomics conditions.</p>
        <p>In particular, according to Fig. 8 Table 6 shows the data about the annual production of research papers and analyses the growth per cluster across the time period.</p>
        <p>According to the total annual paper production per cluster (Fig. 9)</p>
        <p>and to the relative growth (Table 6 and Fig. 10), it is evident that all main research themes are increasing (on average) during the studied period. In particular, cluster 3 (Physical Ergonomics) presents the highest average annual growth. This is also due to the initial absence of papers in 2015. From the safety point of view, the high number of produced papers and the relative slow annual growth entail a consolidated and wellknown knowledge for the cluster Contact Avoidance and Contact Detection and Mitigation. In addition, the data evaluation shows that the actual research tends to focus more on the prevention of unexpected and unwanted contacts (cluster 1 main themes) rather than on the reduction of the collision energy exchange (cluster 2 main themes).</p>
        <p>From the ergonomics point of view, both physical and cognitive/ organizational aspects are emerging and attractive research themes. In the first years of the studied time period, the related themes were addressed only in few works and nearly ignored. Nowadays the paper production is significant. In fact, the difference between the production of papers for both categories safety and ergonomics in the last year of the study (2018) is minimal (16 papers for safety vs. 13 papers for ergonomics). This result shows that the actual research interest in HRI ergonomics leads to a balance in the production of annual papers in both categories.</p>
        <p>Tables 7 and8 and Figs. 11 and 12 explain the structure of clusters and sub-clusters in terms of main research themes distribution and annual paper production. In particular, Table 7 and Fig. 11 show the percentage distribution of main research themes referring to clusters and sub-clusters relationship. Table 8 and Fig. 12 explain the allocation of main research themes in terms of annual papers production referring to cluster and sub-cluster classification among the analyzed period. These data will be useful for the final analysis of every sub-cluster main research themes in order to propose a final discussion and opinion about the results in terms of importance and development during the time period.</p>
        <p>According to the abovementioned data, the final discussion about the results of each sub-clusters analysis is reported in detail in Table 10.</p>
        <p>This table also introduces the concept of main research themes importance, which is classified according to the distribution of works in each sub-cluster among the main research themes. This classification is presented by using five levels through different 'importance class'. Each level (and therefore each importance class) is defined through a range of percentage value which is limited by a minimum and a maximum. Fig. 9. Total annual paper production per cluster (* referring to a two year time period). Fig. 12. Total sub-cluster main themes for each year.</p>
        <p>These thresholds are calculated as explained in Table 9 according to a certain interval. The calculation of the interval is the following: (* = according to Table 7 -Distribution of works in each subcluster among the main research themes)</p>
        <p>The number of levels is equal to five since it is a reasonable value for a proper distinction between different importance classes (a value which is lower than five will provide an approximate classification, a value higher than five will provide a too detailed classification referring to the purpose of the analysis).</p>
        <p>For the calculation of the Min (i) percentage, a constant value of 0.05% for each importance class is added to the previous Max (i) (except for the first Min (i) which is equal to zero). This constant is reasonable small enough to allow the definition of a new importance class without afflicting the influence of the interval value to the level calculation. Finally, Table 11 gives a general overview and comparison about the main results.</p>
        <p>Following, the main limitations of the adopted SLR search approach and the related inclusion/exclusion criteria are explained: (a) Time period: even if the concept of industrial HRI dates back to the nineties, collaborative robots were introduced to the market after the beginning of the Industry 4.0 era and therefore after 2011 [1]. For a broader analysis, it could be useful to extend the review also including the time period which starts from 2011, in order to include the earliest research trends. As in this research we focus on the analysis of emerging research trends in the last few years we limited the period of study to the years from 2015 to 2018. In fact, according to Scopus data, the annual paper production related to safety and ergonomics in HRI is starting to grow significantly from 2015, which is the starting year of the analyzed period. (b) Document type: in order to have only high quality results, the proposed method focused only on journal-type documents. Despite, the inclusion of conference papers could add additional information about recent inputs from research, since the journal publication process is usually quite structured and therefore time-consuming. Nevertheless, it is possible to enlarge the review by adding other research areas such as Medicine or Mathematics. This might improve the number of results, even if the percentage of pertinent themes would probably be rather restricted. In addition, since some relevant industry-related publications about ergonomics and human factors are published in non-technical journals, we want to mention that these works may not be considered into this SLR. (d) SMEs factor: collaborative robotics could be particularly helpful for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For this reason, future reviews could include the term SMEs as a search keyword in the initial search workflow. After a first trial we identified only very few works in the database Scopus for the time period 2015-2018 without setting any further exclusion criteria like subject area or document type. Therefore, we decided to not limit our study only to works related to SMEs, also because very often general works are applicable in both large companies and SMEs. (e) Categorization: based on the research question and the content analysis, the research team identified two main categories (safety and ergonomics), four clusters (Contact Avoidance, Contact Detection and Mitigation, Physical Ergonomics and cognitive/organization ergonomics) and 11 sub-clusters (see also Fig. 2). This categorization and the following identification of the main research themes in recent literature have been defined by a research team consisting of three researchers in order to obtain and present a situation that is as objective as possible. There is the possibility that other researchers might define the categorization in a slightly modified way then used in this work.</p>
        <p>Following, a proposal for future research developments is presented by considering the most important and promising research themes identified in Tables 10 and11 for every cluster.</p>
        <p>The role of safety in HRI should be to protect the operators from the consequences of unexpected and unwanted collisions between human body parts and robot systems and/or workspaces elements by maintaining proper performance of production systems at the same time (Table 12).</p>
        <p>Contact avoidance: the most important and promising research themes for Contact Avoidance are Motion Planning and Control (crucial theme), Sensor Systems for Object Tracking (very important theme) and Safety Management (very important theme). In general, this result confirms the general trend to develop safety systems which focus even more on the safeguard of operators by adopting prevention techniques. For this reason, a proper and coordinated integration between the development of vision systems, robot control and trajectory planning methodologies will be essential. The Safety Management part will be very important to support the application and the evaluation of the proposed safety measures. These aspects are fundamental for a better prediction of collisions and therefore for the minimization of the probability of occurrence.</p>
        <p>Contact detection and mitigation: the most important and promising research themes for Contact Detection and Mitigation are Motion Planning and Control (important theme), Robot System Design (important theme) and sensor system for contact management (important theme). Also in this case, there is a natural correlation between the development of these research themes. Actually, in order to improve the safety measures based on protection techniques, there is the need to work jointly on the development of the features related to the</p>
        <p>Final classification of sub-cluster relevance according to the distribution of works in each sub-cluster among the main research themes and to the distribution of works in each sub-cluster among the analyzed period.</p>
        <p>(continued on robot hardware, the sensor systems for the contact detection and elaboration as well as on the trajectory planning and robot control. These aspects are fundamental for a better management of collision and therefore for the minimization of the related effects.</p>
        <p>The role of ergonomics in HRI should be to support humans in the reduction of work-related biomechanical and cognitive overload without introducing new hazards for the health and safety of the operators (e.g. work-related stress which potentially could arise from the interaction with the robot Physical Ergonomics: the most important and promising research themes for Physical Ergonomics are Task Scheduling (important theme) and Motion Planning and Control (moderately important theme). In general, these results strengthen the concept of human-centered workspaces supported by smart automation systems. In particular, future research should focus on the development of adaptive and realtime Task Scheduling and Motion Planning and Control methodologies. These should allow a reduction of physical workload by changing the work cycle and the robot systems performance according to the operators physical conditions (e.g. individual anthropometric features, age, gender, dominant limb, particular physical limitations or disabilities, fatigue etc.). This condition is a perfect example of implementation of sustainable production systems. In fact, it should improve the operators' wellbeing as well as the possibility to include elderly workforce or personnel with temporal or permanent disability. Of course, this means to provide to the production system a substantial amount of (real-time) personal data about the operators' psychophysical conditions.</p>
        <p>Cognitive ergonomics: the most important and promising research and Simulation and Modelling (moderately important theme). In general, the cognitive part should also focus on the minimization of workrelated psychosocial risks which could potentially arise from the sharing of activities and workspaces. Another important part will be the acceptability of the robot systems by the human coworkers. In fact, a more or less closed interaction produces several advantages but also introduces new forms of discomfort for the operators at the same time.</p>
        <p>In this context and according to the results, it could be important to provide methodologies for collaborative systems evaluation and tests. This could be for the identification and mitigation of potential sources of psychosocial risks. In addition, the design of the main features and performance related to collaborative systems (including the robot motion and control) should consider these aspects. Simulations and model will be very important to support and validate the choices.</p>
        <p>According to the aims of this work, the emerging research challenges and research fields about safety and ergonomics in industrial collaborative robotics were identified and analyzed based on the development of publications over time (annual The limitations and critical issues of the adopted search approach are provided and explained by proposing some useful suggestions for future investigations or reviews. First of all, the results show that there is some vagueness and uncertainty in the definition of safety or ergonomics in the research world. In fact, there are different works which were initially founded by using a specific keyword (safety or ergonomics or human factors), even if the real content of related papers deals with the other topics.</p>
        <p>The results show that the most developed research category is safety, even if ergonomics has been growing significantly in the last two years (especially the cognitive and organizational part). In particular, results show that the majority of high-level (of importance) themes are more related to safety aspects instead of ergonomics. Referring to safety works, there is a higher interest in prevention (which studies safety measures that aim to operate before potential human-robot contacts occur) than in protection (which studies safety measures that aim to minimize the effects of human-robot contacts after the physical interaction occurs). Collision avoidance is the largest cluster characterized by a slow, but constant, paper production rate. Nevertheless, even if ergonomics presented the highest paper production in the last years, the related themes are considered emerging but not yet mature In addition, there is a disequilibrium between the current development of safety (especially for collision avoidance) and ergonomics (both physical, cognitive and organizational), which means that the former aspects may have a greater potential for further developments than the latter in the near future. Taking into account that the industrial collaborative robot market is continuously growing [64], near future collision avoidance systems might allow a general improvement of robots performance while maintaining proper levels of safety. This scenario could generate collaborative production systems where operators are supposed to work even closer to high performance and safe robots. On the other hand, this situation could harm the psychological part of the collaboration and, as a consequence, the efficiency of the production system. The reason is that humans might not trust and accept advanced robotic systems without likewise ergonomics developments in terms of cognitive and organizational knowledge and support.</p>
        <p>In other words, in the near future it will be necessary to catalyze the research effort in the balancing of the developments of different research areas related to HRI. This will be necessary to create genuine and human-oriented potentials and not technological barriers. For these reasons, future developments should focus on the alignment of HRI safety and ergonomics research themes, especially in terms of sustainability, operator well-being and related human-centered design, social This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p>
        <p>Appendix -Step 4: papers processing and classification.</p>
        <p>As a consequence, it might be that in this work we did not consider the latest research studies already published only in conference proceedings and not yet published in high quality journal articles. For further analysis, the papers presented in relevant conferences should be consulted. Following, there is a list of some important examples: Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing (FAIM), CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems (CMS), International Conference on Human-robot Interaction (HRI),</p>
