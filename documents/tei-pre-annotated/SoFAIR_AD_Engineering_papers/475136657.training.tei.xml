        <p>While there are many device-level and infrastructure challenges still to be overcome before wide commercialization can be realized, increasing the PEMFC power density is a critical technical challenge, with ambitious goals proposed globally. For example, the short-term and long-term goals of the Japan New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) are 6 kW L -1 by 2030 and 9 kW L -1 by 2040, respectively. To this end, we propose technical development directions required for next-generation high power density PEMFCs. This perspective comprehensively embraces the latest advanced ideas for improvements in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and its components, bipolar plate (BP), integrated BP-MEA design, with regard to water and thermal management, and materials. The realization of these ideas is expected to be encompassed in next-generation PEMFCs with the aim of achieving a high power density.While there are many device-level and infrastructure challenges still to be overcome before wide commercialization can be realized, increasing the PEMFC power density is a critical technical challenge, with ambitious goals proposed globally.

        <p>Addressing the increasing global energy consumption and environmental pollution caused by fossil energy usage has spurred a worldwide growth in renewable and eco-friendly energy solutions 1 . The hydrogen economy based on renewables, including hydrogen production, hydrogen storage, and conversion of hydrogen to electricity, is considered as a promising solution for the future of energy by many authorities. In the hydrogen economy, fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are a critical segment for delivering low-carbon transport, and the well-to-wheels greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to near zero when hydrogen is produced from renewables [2][3][4] .Addressing the increasing global energy consumption and environmental pollution caused by fossil energy usage has spurred a worldwide growth in renewable and eco-friendly energy solutions 1 .

        <p>As the two low-carbon transport routes, FCVs and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are often compared 5 . Batteries are energy storage devices, whereas fuel cells are energy conversion devices that typically use hydrogen for energy storage. As a storage medium, hydrogen has inherent advantages over lithium-ion batteries, exhibiting higher energy density and shorter refueling time for FCVs 6 . The FCV also outperforms the BEV under subzero temperature conditions, as the BEV often exhibits significantly reduced discharge capacity 7,8 . The cost of FCVs is currently higher than that of BEVs for short-range vehicles (below 200 miles, 322 km); however, their cost is comparable to or lower than that of BEVs with high annual production rates, particularly for long-range vehicles (above 300 miles, 483 km) 6,9 . On the downside, the efficiency of FCVs is considerably lower than that of BEVs on the usage side, and the hydrogen infrastructure is still at the preliminary stage [10][11][12] .As the two low-carbon transport routes, FCVs and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are often compared 5 .

        <p>Based on the differences in their technical characteristics, the prevailing opinion is that FCVs are better suited to heavy-duty and long-distance transportation as well as for other commercial vehicles, such as forklifts, whereas BEVs are more suitable for light-duty and short-distance transportation (Figure 1) 13 . Large-scale expansion of the BEV market has been achieved with the rapid technical development of lithium-ion batteries in the past two decades combined with grid at-home recharging.Based on the differences in their technical characteristics, the prevailing opinion is that FCVs are better suited to heavy-duty and long-distance transportation as well as for other commercial vehicles, such as forklifts, whereas BEVs are more suitable for light-duty and short-distance transportation (Figure 1) 13 .

        <p>As the core component of FCVs, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have technical barriers that need to be overcome; moreover, the performance, cost, and durability of the PEMFC stack significantly affect the large-scale commercialization of FCVs. Improving power density is vital for the development of FCVs 3,5,8 . The stack power densities with and without end plates of the second-generation MIRAI, which is the latest Toyota FCV launched at the end of 2020, achieved 4.4 and 5.4 kW L -1 , an increase of 42% and 54% in comparison with those in the previous generation, respectively 8,14,15 . According to the Japan New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), the 2030 and 2040 targets of the stack power density for automotive applications are 6.0 and 9.0 kW L -1 , respectively 16 . The European Union Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (EU-FCH2JU) recently demonstrated their PEMFC stack with a power density of 5.38 kW L -1 (with end plates) at 2.67 A cm -2 and 0.6 V 17 , and the goal is 9.3 kW L -1 by 2024 18 .As the core component of FCVs, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have technical barriers that need to be overcome; moreover, the performance, cost, and durability of the PEMFC stack significantly affect the large-scale commercialization of FCVs.

        <p>An overview of the progressive improvements needed for PEMFCs to meet the future high power density requirements is illustrated in Figure 2, accompanied by a schematic explanation of the working principle. The current technical status and the widely acknowledged prospects of PEMFCs are listed based on individual components. A typical single PEMFC generally comprises a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and bipolar plates (BPs), wherein the MEA comprises a gas diffusion layer (GDL) with a microporous layer (MPL), catalyst layer (CL), and proton exchange membrane (PEM). In addition to the desired electrical output, water and heat are generated by electrochemical reactions, which affect the PEMFC operation. It is vital to maintain an appropriate water content and a suitable operating temperature, through water and thermal management, to attain a desirable trade-off among sufficient PEM hydration, unobstructed reactant supply, high catalyst activity, and adequate component lifetime. The GDL is a layer of carbon paper, which plays multiple important roles in gas distribution, mechanical support, and electrical connection. It is typically attached to another layer made up of carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), commonly known as the MPL, which assists in the timely removal of electrochemically produced water. The CL is the site wherein the hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction electrochemical reactions occur through a series of coupled physiochemical processes. Platinum (Pt)-loaded carbon, which is finely dispersed with ionomer, is the most commonly used catalyst owing to its excellent activity and durability in an electrochemical environment. Decreasing the platinum group metal (PGM) loading is an unchanging goal for the development of CL owing to its high cost and limited resources. The core component of a PEMFC is the PEM, which functions as a proton conductor, an electrical insulator, and a gas separator. Better temperature-and humidity-range tolerances, as well as sufficient mechanical strength, are necessary to meet the future higher power density and durability demands. The BP is a rigid support structure in the PEMFC stack onto which the reactant and coolant flow fields are fabricated, and is responsible for current collection and heat dissipation. However, the BP also constitutes a large proportion of the stack volume and cost. A thinner structured BP with better mass transfer capacity, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and lower cost is an inevitable design strategy to achieve higher power density and lower-cost PEMFCs 15 . A more detailed perspective of potential expectations and possible avenues for implementation at the component level, as depicted in Figure 2, are elaborated in the following sections.An overview of the progressive improvements needed for PEMFCs to meet the future high power density requirements is illustrated in Figure 2, accompanied by a schematic explanation of the working principle.

        <p>According to the state-of-the-art FCV products and worldwide fuel cell programs, the volume power density of the stack with end plates is expected to reach 6 kW L -1 in the next 5-10 years, with the working current density and cell voltage increasing to 3-4 A cm -2 and 0.7-0.8 V, respectively. Furthermore, an ultimate stack target of 9 kW L -1 may be achieved with further developments, with cell operating points raised to even higher levels, such as 4-5 A cm -2 and 0.8-0.9 V. The mathematical conversion between the two description indices of the PEMFC performance (volume power density of stack kW L -1 and current density of active area A cm -2 ) is based on public domain data and a calculation of the number of cells and the thickness of the end plates.

        <p>The MEA consists of several individual components, namely the electrically conductive GDL that allows gases to permeate through, the CL in which the redox reactions occur, and the PEM, which acts as the electrolyte.

        <p>In the foreseeable future, carbon paper is expected to continue to be the mainstream choice for GDLs owing to its comprehensive advantages in electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, chemical resistance, and fabrication cost 19 . Structural modification of a GDL, such as laser perforation, has been tested, and may provide a potential future direction 20 . Owing to scale-discrepant transport characteristics between the BP and MEA (pore sizes range from the micron-to nano-scale), mass transfer for gas permeation and water management is complex. It is speculated that GDLs with a gradient pore size, possibly via manipulation of the carbon fiber arrangement, are expected to establish a more effective bridge between the flow field and MEA and improve the mass transfer ability of the MEA itself, as depicted in Figure 3a-I [21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31] . For example, decreasing the porosity on one or both sides of the GDL may reduce the contact resistance and create pore gradients inside the GDL to facilitate reactant supply and water removal.In the foreseeable future, carbon paper is expected to continue to be the mainstream choice for GDLs owing to its comprehensive advantages in electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, chemical resistance, and fabrication cost 19 .

        <p>Another important factor is the interfacial resistance between components, which mainly depends on the material properties and assembly process. The contact resistance between the BP and GDL is the main source of electrical impedance, which is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the resistance of the GDL itself (estimated with a GDL conductivity of 10 3 S m -1 , thickness of 150 μm, and contact resistance of 10 -6 Ω m 2 ). A metal sheet GDL has been used to lower the ohmic loss 32 ; however, the problem of corrosion still needs to be solved. With the consideration of alleviating or even eliminating the interfacial effect, the concept of component integration or unification is proposed, which entails replacing the BP and GDL with another component to meet the requirements of electric conduction, gas distribution, and water management simultaneously 33 . The mass transfer path becomes shorter (expected through-plane distance, from 0.5-0.6 mm to 0.3-0.4 mm) to fulfill the demand of higher current density (3-4 A cm -2 ). This so-called integrated BP-MEA or GDL-less design, for example, adopting foam materials (see Figure 3a-II), is further discussed in the section Integrated porous BP-MEA design.Another important factor is the interfacial resistance between components, which mainly depends on the material properties and assembly process.

        <p>The proposed future power density target (6-9 kW L -1 ) also imposes higher requirements on water management capability. The MPL coating (typically 20-40% PTFE content) on the GDL impedes liquid water from pooling at the CL/MPL interface, thereby diminishing the blocking effect of liquid water on the gas transport 34 . Nevertheless, with the continuous improvement of membrane materials to tolerate higher temperatures and lower humidity, water management can be simplified 16 .The proposed future power density target (6-9 kW L -1 ) also imposes higher requirements on water management capability.

        <p>For instance, a hydrophilic anode and hydrophobic cathode or MEA divided into hydrophilic and hydrophobic zones may better fit the operation of a PEMFC stack operating without an external humidifier. It is anticipated that the development of GDLs together with MPLs will make ~10% contribution toward the improvement of power density, owing to the improved matching of other components (see Supplementary Information for the estimation).For instance, a hydrophilic anode and hydrophobic cathode or MEA divided into hydrophilic and hydrophobic zones may better fit the operation of a PEMFC stack operating without an external humidifier.

        <p>The maximum power density is dominated by the performance of the CLs. To achieve a power density of 9 kW L -1 at a low catalyst loading, a high cell output voltage over 0.8 V and current density of 4.4 A cm -2 are required 16 ; however, this requires significant breakthroughs in catalyst activity and CL design, as depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 3b.The maximum power density is dominated by the performance of the CLs.

        <p>One main approach to increasing the specific activity (SA) or mass activity (MA) of the catalyst is to design a novel catalyst architecture (nanocage 21 , core-shell 22 , nanoframes 23 , nanowire 24 , nanocrystals 25 , etc.). A representative example is Pt 3 Ni nanoframe catalysts with extended platinum surfaces, which display enhancement factors of 36 in MA and 22 in SA in comparison with commercial Pt/C catalyst 23 . Thus far, the highest SA and MA values reported are 11.5 mA cm -2 and 13.6 A mg Pt -1 respectively, by using ultrafine jagged platinum nanowires 24 . However, these catalysts are typically evaluated using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method, with little practical application being reported at the MEA level. Recently, a breakthrough catalyst with an ultra-low concentration of Pt alloy supported on PGM-free materials (denoted as LP@PF-1) achieved an MA of 1.08 A mg Pt -1 and retained 64% of its initial value after 30,000 cycles in a fuel cell. However, MA decreased by one order of magnitude in comparison with the value measured by RDE 22 . Furthermore, some Pt nanoparticles are considered to be metastable, and the shape geometries diminish with catalyst age 35 . Thus, a future challenge is the stabilization of catalyst particle shapes to enhance their durability and simultaneously maintain their ultra-high SA or MA in an operating fuel cell environment.One main approach to increasing the specific activity (SA) or mass activity (MA) of the catalyst is to design a novel catalyst architecture (nanocage 21 , core-shell 22 , nanoframes 23 , nanowire 24 , nanocrystals 25 , etc.).

        <p>Ionomers, in contact with the catalyst, ensure accessibility and transport of protons to and from the catalyst particles at the cathode and anode. Their distribution has a pronounced effect on ionic conductivity and Pt catalyst utilization 26 . For example, recent research showed that Nitrogen-doped carbon supports could ensure unprecedented uniform coverage of the ionomer due to coulombic attraction between the ionomer and N groups on the carbon support, eventually achieving fuel cell power densities of up to 1.39 W cm -2 for a pure Pt catalyst 26 . Furthermore, carbon supports with a preferred internal pore opening of 4-7 nm simultaneously conferred excellent ORR activity and transport properties 27 . These results indicated that appropriate modification of the carbon supports could lead to marked improvements in PEMFC power densities. Interestingly, with regard to the catalyst/ionomer interface, shortening the side-chain length of ionomers also enhanced proton transport, but decreased local O 2 -transport 28 , suggesting another promising approach to achieving a balanced trade-off between proton transport and oxygen transport as well as promoting full utilization of the Pt catalyst 36 . In addition, given that the water swelling/de-swelling of the ionomer may cause interfacial degradation between the CL and PEM 37 , the ionomer must be dimensionally and physically compatible with the PEM with which it is in contact 38 . A previous study demonstrated that it is of great significance to develop ionomers with high stability and reliable water retention ability for fabricating MEAs with improved durability and good performance in the future 39 .Ionomers, in contact with the catalyst, ensure accessibility and transport of protons to and from the catalyst particles at the cathode and anode.

        <p>An ideal membrane for high-power PEMFCs is one with high proton conductivity under low humidity conditions and good electrochemical and mechanical stability 44 . To improve the power density of fuel cells by optimizing the PEMs, the main strategy is to reduce the membrane thickness of commercial Perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)-based membranes. For example, the first-generation MIRAI adopted a state-of-the-art reinforced ultra-thin membrane (~10 µm) 45 , which not only reduced the proton and water transport path, but also achieved self-humidification to avoid anode dryness; however, thin membranes also face challenges of mechanical damage or electrochemical degradation 46,47 . Thin perfluorinated membranes reinforced with PTFE exhibited enhanced mechanical and dimensional stability, while the first-generation MIRAI used a porous media flow field over the cathode GDL to further enhance the mechanical support of the thin PEM 45 . Another classic strategy to extend the stability of thin membranes, which is used in commercial practice, is to incorporate cerium salt into the membrane 48 . For example, the second-generation MIRAI adopted the new Gore-Select ® Membrane 49 containing cerium salt, which achieved improved performance and mechanical durability, despite being 30% thinner than the previous version. Furthermore, polydopamine-treated composite membranes with self-supported CeO x radical scavengers exhibited simultaneously enhanced chemical/mechanical durability, which might be an innovative approach for stabilizing future high-performance PEMFCs (as depicted in Figure 3c) 29 .An ideal membrane for high-power PEMFCs is one with high proton conductivity under low humidity conditions and good electrochemical and mechanical stability 44 .

        <p>However, many hydrocarbon-based PEMs commonly suffer from relatively low conductivity at low RH, for example, &lt;40% RH, compared with PFSA 54,55 . Examples of some of the most promising hydrocarbon-based PEMs in terms of stability or fuel cell performance under low RH conditions are sulfonated polyphenylenes [56][57][58] , phosphoric acid quaternary amine-biphosphate ion pair membranes 59 and interpenetrating network membranes 60 . To address low RH and elevated temperature operation, cactus-inspired nano-crack-structured self-humidifying membranes have been reported 30 . Thin (~nm) hydrophobic layers with nano-cracks on the surface of hydrocarbon FEM can regulate water retention, even at low humidities and elevated temperatures (~120 °C). Recently, through-plane oriented proton transport channels in hydrocarbon PEMs demonstrated efficient proton conduction even at significantly low RH (20-40%) and exhibited a fairly high power output at 120 °C (Figure 3c) 31 . Most interestingly, these PEMs with oriented proton transport structures also displayed considerably high water retention due to their microporous structures and unexpected durability compared with that of Nafion ® 212 61 . Furthermore, ferrocyanide groups incorporated into polymeric structures imparted both proton conduction and a high resistance to oxidative free radical degradation, suggesting that this strategy may be a new avenue toward ferrocyanide-stabilized inexpensive durable hydrocarbon-based PEMs 62 . An OCV held at 90 °C and 30% RH on MEAs displayed only ~2.0% loss after 80 h, in comparison with a 28.2% loss for Nafion ® after 50 h.However, many hydrocarbon-based PEMs commonly suffer from relatively low conductivity at low RH, for example, &lt;40% RH, compared with PFSA 54,55 .

        <p>The mass transport capacity is an important criterion for a BP design, which is mainly dependent on the flow field structure 73 . Currently, there are two established design routes for BP structural designs, as shown in Figure 4. One is to modify and narrow the channel-rib structure, and the other is to develop flow fields with no ribs but with micro baffles or porous structures. These routes have shown some advantages over conventional designs, but they are also accompanied by new complications. The 3-D fine-mesh BP of the first-generation MIRAI with baffles stamped in a fish-scale pattern, for example, had demonstrated efficient mass transfer 67 . However, the tearing process also caused fracture surface cracks, exposing the metallic substrate to an acidic electrochemical environment 74 . Furthermore, progressive stamping of refined meshes increases the BP costs. The U.S. DOE requires that the BP should achieve a permeability to hydrogen and oxygen lower than 2×10 -6 m 2 by 2020, while the current flow channels/fields with a depth lower than 0.5 mm can easily reach a permeability of 10 -8 m 2 . Toyota has replaced the 3-D flow field by a 2-D wave channel on the second-generation MIRAI. These indicate that the mass transport capacity may not be a major concern for the current stacks. However, there is still a gulf between the current status (4.4 kW L -1 for second-generation MIRAI) and the power density goal as high as 9 kW L -1 , and the current density goal of 4.4 A cm -2 (by Japan NEDO) 16 . A concomitant increase in the gas flow rate can exacerbate the pressure drop and maldistribution in the flow channels/fields, leading to an increase in parasitic power loss, local fuel starvation, and thus mass transfer loss. Another issue is the liquid removal induced by a high electrochemical water production rate. Although modified MEAs can be operated at lower humidification levels, water condensation and accumulation are still difficult to avoid, particularly at current densities of 2 A cm -2 and above 75 . However, at operating temperatures of 100 °C and above, this issue might be largely mitigated by evaporation. In summary, the enhancement of mass transfer remains a dominant challenge for the BP design of next-generation PEMFCs.The mass transport capacity is an important criterion for a BP design, which is mainly dependent on the flow field structure 73 .

        <p>Heat and electron conduction are two other challenges in BP design. Because the heat dissipated from the cell edges or removed by mass flow is almost negligible, most of the waste heat must be transferred through the MEA and BP and then removed by the external radiator coolant through thermal convection 76 . For a stack with a power density of ~4 kW L -1 , the BP has a thermal conductivity ~30 times higher than that of the GDL or CL, but the interfacial thermal resistance between the BP and GDL can be ~10 times larger than that in BP 77 . The interfacial electrical resistance between the BP and GDL (~10 -6 Ω m 2 ) is nearly four orders of magnitude higher than that in BP (~10 -10 Ω m 2 ). While current metal separators can easily reach thermal and electrical conductivity values of 50 W m -1 K -1 and 1.4×10 6 S m -1 , respectively, far exceeding the U.S. DOE criteria for 2020, the interfacial resistance is only comparable 68 . Japan NEDO proposed that the output voltage and operating temperature should be further improved from the current status, that is, 0.65 V and 90-100 °C, to 0.85 V and 120 °C in 2040 16 . Thus, the major concern is to reduce the thermal and electrical interfacial contact resistance between the BP and GDL, which is sensitive to the cell stack compactness, contact area between BP and MEA, BP surface roughness, and substrate conductivity. In addition, the current coolant channels must be integrated with hydrogen and/or air distributors for a compact cell structure, inferring a conflict between the cooling capacity and thickness reduction.Heat and electron conduction are two other challenges in BP design.

        <p>The durability of BP is predominantly influenced by electrochemical corrosion and mechanical degradation. A further increase in the current density (~3.8 A cm -2 by 2030, Japan NEDO 16 ), may cause an increase in the electrochemical corrosion of the components may be a leading cause of cell degradation, especially for metal BPs. For carbon BPs, corrosion also occurs, but is almost negligible under normal operating conditions. To mitigate corrosion, the BP is generally treated with a passive layer by incorporating materials capable of forming low-resistance oxide films or by the deposition of corrosion-resistant coatings. The efficacy of corrosion resistance is mainly determined by the uniformity of defect-free coatings, stable passive films, or nitride layers 78 .

However, an advanced coating technique is still necessary to achieve better corrosion resistance, lower contact resistance, and, most importantly, lower coating cost 66,67 . Mechanically, the swelling and shrinking of the MEA and pressure variations of the gas and coolant may induce load and pressure fluctuations of the metal BP, leading to plastic deformation and fatigue failure 79 .

        <p>While achieving target transport capabilities, the fabrication capacity of BPs should correspond with the industrial base for the mass production of fuel cell products. The cost and volume of BPs can account for over 30% and 70% of the entire PEMFC stack, respectively, depending on the substrate material, fabrication capacity, and coating technique, etc 64 . The U.S. DOE criterion for 2020 for the total BP cost, inclusive of materials, forming, and coating, is $3 kW -1 . However, for the substrate material, such as SS 316L, the cost alone is close to $3 kW -1 (~$2.7 kW -1 ), making it difficult to achieve this goal 67 . Furthermore, utilizing ultra-refined plates has recently become a widely adopted approach for BP design, but it requires high precision and rapid fabrication processes for metal or graphite substrates, such as progressive stamping and compression molding. The precision and uniform manufacturing of both BPs and coatings are anticipated to be major technical obstacles for high-volume production.

        <p>Recently, a new type of BP has been proposed that utilizes a metal/graphene porous foam as a reactant distributor 82 . With appropriate mechanical properties, uniform mass and heat distribution can be achieved with a reduced volume and weight of a porous BP 83 . These porous materials can be fabricated at a considerably lower cost than that of refined ribs or baffles, and their geometric parameters, including porosity, pore density, and pore shape, are controllable 84 . This may extend to the complete removal of the GDL and its replacement with porous material solely for mass transport between the CL and external environment, i.e., an integrated porous BP-MEA design. In addition to a more compact cell structure, this integration may advantageously eliminate the interfacial transport of mass, heat, and electrons between the BP and GDL, thereby avoiding interfacial transport resistances. Tanaka et al. 33 introduced a GDL-less cell design using a corrugated SS mesh flow channel rather than a porous material and a freestanding MPL, demonstrating the feasibility of integration. Park et al. 85 adopted graphene foam to fabricate a unified flow field/GDL without an MPL. The cell thickness decreased by 82% while achieving a higher power output over a wide current density range. Although better performance is achieved with a thinner cell through the integrated BP-MEA design, porous flow field materials with high electrical conductivity are susceptible to chemical corrosion in acidic environments. Consequently, effective coating materials and coating methods for 3-D porous structures are necessary to achieve long-term operational stability. Moreover, porous materials exhibit a lower stiffness than conventional BPs. A BP stiffness enhancement process, for example, compression, is necessary to avoid over-deformation of the flow field. In summary, integrated BP-MEA or GDL-less designs can simultaneously improve mass transport, alleviate water flooding, and decrease the volume of PEMFC stacks and may provide a promising avenue for ultra-high power density (9 kW L -1 ) owing to significant improvements in stack compactness.Recently, a new type of BP has been proposed that utilizes a metal/graphene porous foam as a reactant distributor 82 .
