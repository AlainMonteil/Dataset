        <p>Here, we present oxygen-deficient black ZrO 2-x as a new material for sunlight absorption with a low band gap around ~1.5 eV, via a controlled magnesiothermic reduction in 5% H 2 /Ar from white ZrO 2 , a wide bandgap(~5 eV) semiconductor, usually not considered for solar light absorption. It shows for the first time a dramatic increase in solar light absorbance and significant activity for solar light-induced H 2 production from methanol-water with excellent stability up to 30 days while white ZrO 2 fails. Generation of large amounts of oxygen vacancies or surface defects clearly visualized by the HR-TEM and HR-SEM images is the main reason for the drastic alteration of the optical properties through the formation of new energy states near valence band and conduction band towards Fermi level in black ZrO 2-x as indicated by XPS and DFT calculations of black ZrO 2-x . Current reduction method using Mg and H 2 is mild, but highly efficient to produce solar light-assisted photocatalytically active black ZrO 2-x .Here, we present oxygen-deficient black ZrO 2-x as a new material for sunlight absorption with a low band gap around ~1.5 eV, via a controlled magnesiothermic reduction in 5% H 2 /Ar from white ZrO 2 , a wide bandgap(~5 eV) semiconductor, usually not considered for solar light absorption.

        <p>The ever-growing worries about future energy resources for the mankind stimulate the present scientific research community to develop new materials for sunlight harvesting. In general, zirconia (ZrO 2 ) is not considered for sunlight absorption as it is a semiconductor with a wide band gap of around 5 eV and absorbs only ultraviolet (UV) light although ZrO 2 -based materials have promising application in several fields like thermal coating, optical coating, sensor, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, and biomedical applications [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] .The ever-growing worries about future energy resources for the mankind stimulate the present scientific research community to develop new materials for sunlight harvesting.

        <p>Recently, black TiO 2-x materials were achieved by creating oxygen vacancies and/or defects at surface using different methods such as H 2 treatment, chemical reduction, chemical oxidation, electrochemical reduction, and anodization-annealing [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] . Fascinatingly, they exhibited an extended absorption in visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) instead of only UV light that is usually absorbed by white TiO 2 . After its discovery, black TiO 2-x finds several applications, but more importantly, it shows improved photocatalytic activity for H 2 generation and environmental pollutant removal in comparison to its white counterpart. Such drastic change of the properties in black TiO 2-x was mainly ascribed to the high amount of oxygen vacancy and/or surface defects and Ti 3+ , which introduce new energy bands near Fermi level. Consequently, the electronic band gap decreases from 3.2 (anatase) to ~1 eV 14,15 . The concept of introduction of defects was also used for other metal oxides to improve their optical properties [24][25][26][27][28][29][30] .Recently, black TiO 2-x materials were achieved by creating oxygen vacancies and/or defects at surface using different methods such as H 2 treatment, chemical reduction, chemical oxidation, electrochemical reduction, and anodization-annealing [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] .

        <p>In this context, the fabrication of oxygen-deficient black ZrO 2-x will be interesting to study the change in properties concerning sunlight harvesting. However, it will be more challenging as the electronic band gap of ZrO 2 is higher than TiO 2 . Not only that, the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ZrO 2 (820-880 kJmol -1 at the surface and 860 kJmol -1 for bulk) is also higher than that of TiO 2 (530-580 kJmol -1 at the surface and 670 kJmol -1 for bulk) 2,31 . Thus, the previous studies on reduced and/or oxygen deficient ZrO 2-x have employed more drastic conditions like high-temperature evacuation, high temperature and pressure H 2 treatment and Ar + bombardment 2,32-41 , and mainly investigated the resulting change in electronic properties, but no solar light harvesting and photocatalytic studies have been performed. There is no meaningful report on fabrication of black ZrO 2-x for solar light harvesting to the best of our knowledge, which inspires us to develop black ZrO 2-x to perceive the changes of properties and photocatalytic activity.In this context, the fabrication of oxygen-deficient black ZrO 2-x will be interesting to study the change in properties concerning sunlight harvesting.

        <p>To study the possibilities of synthesis of black ZrO 2-x (BZ), we employed simple and mild two-step method that involves magnesiothermic reduction of commercially available monoclinic white ZrO 2 (WZ) in the presence of 5% H 2 /Ar followed by HCl treatment to remove all the Mg species (see methods) 21 . The color of resulting zirconia material was black and named as BZ (Fig. 1a). The molar ratio of ZrO 2 and Mg was optimized to get black ZrO 2-xTo study the possibilities of synthesis of black ZrO 2-x (BZ), we employed simple and mild two-step method that involves magnesiothermic reduction of commercially available monoclinic white ZrO 2 (WZ) in the presence of 5% H 2 /Ar followed by HCl treatment to remove all the Mg species (see methods) 21 .

        <p>and a trend of color change was observed (Supplementary Figure S1). Unless mentioned with a specific molar ratio of Mg, BZ was prepared with 1:1 molar ratio of ZrO 2 and Mg and analyzed to examine the properties. The materials were first characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The BZ shows almost pure monoclinic ZrO 2 phase as like as the pristine white ZrO 2 (Fig. 1b). The XRD pattern does not indicate any significant change in the crystal structure during magnesiothermic reduction. The crystallite size (Supplementary Table S1) of the BZ (19.6 nm) is also almost similar to that of WZ (20.2 nm). However, the drastic color change indicates some major alteration, possibly at the surface of the ZrO 2 particles. This can be presumed as, during the reduction process, Mg was converted to MgO (Supplementary Figure S2) by taking up the surface oxygen, and thus, the chemical structure of ZrO 2 can be disturbed at the surface. This indicates major alteration at the surface of BZ nanoparticles (NPs) in the form of defects.and a trend of color change was observed (Supplementary Figure S1).

        <p>To study the surface alteration, the samples were further characterized by Raman spectroscopy as it is locally sensitive to the disorder in the first few atomic shells at the surface and lattice defects, which are not detectable in XRD analysis. Interestingly, the Raman spectra (Fig. 1c) of BZ are remarkably changed compared with that of WZ, and the corresponding peaks are broadened, and peak intensity is enormously decreased. This result supports the presumption about surface alteration during reduction, which results in black coloration and also indicates the possible formation of huge oxygen vacancy at the surface. The phenomena can be understood as the crystal arrangements of the surface Zr-O units are disturbed during reduction due to oxygen vacancy, which results in the disordered surface. Further, high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images of BZ (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figure S3 d-I) clearly demonstrate the formation of random defects on BZ NPs unlike WZ, which shows well-defined crystalline lattice structure (see Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figure S3 a-c). Furthermore, the line profile (Supplementary Figure S4) of the HR-TEM images of BZ clearly visualizes the presence of disorder lattice pattern in the defected area. The size of the WZ and BZ NPs was almost identical with around 25-30 nm. The surface alteration was further witnessed by high resolution-scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) images (see Fig. 2c,d), which illustrate that the smooth and clean surface of WZ NPs changed to uneven and hollow surface in BZ as indicated by arrow marks. These HR-TEM and HR-SEM images may be the first visualized evidence of surface defects in BZ. The distribution, size and shape of the defects or disorders are clearly visualized by these techniques.To study the surface alteration, the samples were further characterized by Raman spectroscopy as it is locally sensitive to the disorder in the first few atomic shells at the surface and lattice defects, which are not detectable in XRD analysis.

        <p>Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also investigated to study the alteration of the bonding environment of Zr and O at the surface. The high resolution XPS spectrum of Zr 3d electron (Fig. 3a) of BZ shows two peaks at 182.0 and 184.2 eV in accordance with the counterpart peaks (182.4 and 184.8 eV) of WZ corresponding to 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 electron of Zr 4+ , respectively 42 . Further analysis of deconvoluted BZ's Zr 3d XPS spectrum can illustrate the presence of another set of peaks corresponding to reduced Zr species, i.e. Zr (4-x)+ . However, no indication was observed for metallic Zr (~178 eV) 42 . Interestingly, the high-resolution O 1 s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b) of the BZ shows a long tail towards higher binding energy compared with the white sample. On deconvolution of the spectrum, it resolved into two distinguishable peaks centered at 530.5 and 531.9 eV corresponding to the lattice oxygen and non-lattice oxygen (i.e. oxygen vacancy), respectively. It can be also observed that the amount of the oxygen vacancy is higher in BZ than in WZ. The relative amount of the oxygen vacancy is 71% at the surface of BZ while 43% for WZ as obtained from the corresponding peak area (Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, these results clearly indicate the formation of large amounts of oxygen vacancy during the synthesis of black ZrO 2-x and well agree with the XRD, Raman and HR-TEM analysis.Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also investigated to study the alteration of the bonding environment of Zr and O at the surface.

        <p>Formation of the huge amount of oxygen vacancy and reduced Zr species is further evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis (Supplementary Figure S5). The EPR spectrum of BZ shows a very sharp signal at g = 2.00 and a small peak at g = 1.98 corresponding to free electron coming from oxygen vacancy and Zr 3+ , respectively, whereas WZ does not show any significant EPR signal 35,43 . The presence of oxygen deficiency in BZ was further evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis (Supplementary Figure S6) in the presence of oxygen, which shows a weight increment after ~150 °C, indicating the oxygen uptake. The full XPS survey spectra of the BZ and WZ (Supplementary Figure S7) displayed no peak for Mg, further confirming the absence of Mg in the BZ. In addition, N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms also indicated no significant alteration (Supplementary Figure S8 and Table S3) in textural properties of BZ compared with WZ. The BET surface areas are determined to be 24 and 25 m 2 g -1 for WZ and BZ, respectively, indicating little change in physical surface properties between WZ and BZ.Formation of the huge amount of oxygen vacancy and reduced Zr species is further evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis (Supplementary Figure S5).

        <p>The UV-VIS-IR absorption spectra of as-prepared BZ samples were measured to study the absorbance of as-synthesized black zirconia. As expected, the black ZrO 2-x sample exhibited a drastic enhancement (Fig. 4a) in the light absorption in the range of VIS and IR region compared with its white counterpart which absorbs only UV light and shows a sharp absorption peak at ~246 nm. The increment in light absorption also increases with the Mg amount used during sample preparation in accordance with the color change trend of white to gray to black (Supplementary Figure S1 andS9). The band gap of the samples was determined from Tauc plot (Fig. 4b) obtained from the UV-VIS data. The band gap of the BZ is 4.55 eV, and an adjusted band gap is obtained to be around 1.52 eV, which may correspond to the black color of the sample, while the band gap of WZ is 5.09 eV. Furthermore, the position of the valence band (VB) top was determined by VB XPS spectra (Fig. 4c). It clearly indicates the movement of the VB top to upwards and also the extended tail formation to decrease the band gap of BZ compared with WZ. The approximate positions of the VB top and CB (conduction band) bottom were calculated (Supplementary Table S4) from the above results, and the probable band energy diagram is portrayed in Fig. 4d. This drastic change in band gap due to formation of new energy states near VB top and CB bottom can be attributed to the presence of high oxygen vacancy and Zr 3+ in BZ 16,34,44 .The UV-VIS-IR absorption spectra of as-prepared BZ samples were measured to study the absorbance of as-synthesized black zirconia.

        <p>The experimental results were further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Figure 5a shows a monoclinic ZrO 2 crystal structure (WZ model) composed of 12 atoms per unit cell. The monoclinic phase has two kinds of non-equivalent oxygen atoms: 4-fold coordinated (O 4f ) and 3-fold coordinated (O 3f ) 2,31,44 . One O 4f vacancy was used for a BZ model (Fig. 5b) since the oxygen vacancy formation energy was calculated to be 0.1 eV lower than that of the O 3f . The band gap of a WZ was calculated as 5.14 eV by HSE06 method as shown . The VB mid-gap states are hybridized from both O 2p orbitals and Zr 4d orbitals as the result of disordered states of black ZrO 2-x 31 , like black TiO 2-x 15,16,46,47 . The above results confirm that the disordered states of ZrO 2-x were developed during magnesiothermic reduction process, which creates large amount surface defects (as nicely visualized in HR-TEM and HR-SEM images) via oxygen vacancies.The experimental results were further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation.

        <p>These new DOS at VB and CB tails can effectively block the recombination of electrons and holes and enable absorption of sunlight over a wider range of wavelengths including visible-light. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Supplementary Figure S10) were recorded using the same excitation wavelength (325 nm) and same slit (5 nm). The intensity of the PL spectrum corresponding to the black sample is much less than that of the white sample, although the peak positions are almost the same, which indicates the slower rate of electron-hole recombination, which can be ascribed to the result of electron and hole trapped in the newly formed energy bands at the CV bottom and VB top, respectively 44,48 .These new DOS at VB and CB tails can effectively block the recombination of electrons and holes and enable absorption of sunlight over a wider range of wavelengths including visible-light.

        <p>The enhanced solar light absorption of the BZ was further characterized by photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) in the presence of simulated solar light (1 sun, AM 1.5G). The results (Supplementary Figure S11) clearly indicate that WZ has almost no degradation ability in the presence of solar light, whereas the BZ shows sufficient degradation of RhB, which can be attributed to the improved solar light absorbance of BZ compare with WZ.The enhanced solar light absorption of the BZ was further characterized by photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) in the presence of simulated solar light (1 sun, AM 1.5G).

        <p>The BZ was also investigated for the H 2 generation from water using photo-deposited Pt NPs (~1.0 wt%) as a co-catalyst and methanol as a sacrificial reagent under simulated sunlight (1 sun, AM 1.5G). The BZ generated significant amount of H 2 with a rate of 505 μ molg -1 h -1 while no H 2 was obtained from WZ (Fig. 6a). The calculated solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency is 0.11% with respect to 1 sun incident power and present reaction setup (see Supplementary for detail) 49 . The H 2 generation ability of BZ in sunlight is directly accredited to the drastically improved optical properties (solar light absorbance) and low band gap. Formation of the new DOS in the energy level enables the BZ to absorb the visible light and also generate H 2 by water splitting under solar light. The stability test (Fig. 6b) for BZ demonstrated that almost similar amount of H 2 produced in each run (120 min), which indicates the excellent stability (up to 30 days) of the black zirconia samples. Here, it should be mentioned that the color, absorbance, and H 2 generation ability were almost the same after 1 month when samples were stored in the normal atmosphere in sample vial without any extra precaution.

        <p>The H 2 production ability was further investigated for the samples prepared with the different ratios of Mg with respect to ZrO 2 and in different conditions (Supplementary Figure S12). The results suggested that the ratio (1:1) can be considered as an optimum ratio. Further, we have synthesized reduced zirconia using only hydrogen (5% H 2 /Ar), only Mg (in Ar), and only Ar in the same reaction conditions to study the uniqueness of the present methods (see methods for detail). All the materials were studied for the hydrogen production using the same experimental conditions. Interestingly, the material prepared using only Ar did not show any hydrogen production, whereas the materials prepared by only Mg and hydrogen show a little amount of hydrogen in the same experimental conditions under the solar light. These results clearly demonstrate the requirement of both Mg and H 2 for the preparation of photocatalytically active black ZrO 2-x . These results also indicate that controlled hydrogen reduction may also achieve good ZrO 2-x photocatalyst despite low reducibility with H 2 mentioned in the previous study 2,33 . It also makes us more curious to know why Mg and H 2 both are required and how they function. One may suggest that H 2 is absorbed on the defect site created by Mg and form Zr-H active species for photocatalysis like Ti-H in hydrogenated black TiO 2-x 14,50 . We are further working to find out the probable reason and understand the involved chemical reactions in our lab.The H 2 production ability was further investigated for the samples prepared with the different ratios of Mg with respect to ZrO 2 and in different conditions (Supplementary Figure S12).

        <p>In conclusions, oxygen-deficient black zirconia (ZrO 2-x ) was prepared via the magnesiothermic reduction in H 2 /Ar atmosphere, which resulted in a drastic increment in solar light absorption and band gap decrement (to 1.52 from 5.09 eV for white ZrO 2 ). A prominent surface alteration in the form of defects or disorders associated with the oxygen vacancy in black zirconia was well characterized and nicely visualized by high resolution microscopic techniques. Excitingly, the oxygen-deficient black ZrO 2-x shows good photocatalytic performance for RhB degradation and H 2 production under simulated solar light (AM 1.5G) while white ZrO 2 fails. Thus, white ZrO 2 , an inactive materials for sunlight harvesting has been transformed to an active black ZrO 2-x . The employed process involves a simple and mild magnesiothermic reduction at 650 °C in presence of H 2 /Ar. The results indicate that both Mg and H 2 are necessary for the preparation of efficient solar light-assisted photocatalytically active black ZrO 2-x . The findings are highly important and innovative with respect to sunlight harvesting since this work presents the first report on solar light-assisted photocatalytic activity of black ZrO 2-x and can be considered as proof of concept for developing more novel materials for solar energy utilization. Our developed black ZrO 2-x material could be interesting for not only solar light-assisted photocatalytic application but also in other solar energy applications as well as applications like catalysis, sensors, energy conversion and storage, coating, and biomedical tests. This material offers a new choice, and the study will unveil a new direction to the scientific community working in diverse areas of material science and applications.In conclusions, oxygen-deficient black zirconia (ZrO 2-x ) was prepared via the magnesiothermic reduction in H 2 /Ar atmosphere, which resulted in a drastic increment in solar light absorption and band gap decrement (to 1.52 from 5.09 eV for white ZrO 2 ).

        <p>Preparation of oxygen-deficient black ZrO 2-x . Commercially available monoclinic (as observed in XRD analysis) nano ZrO 2 (WZ) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as it is. Well-mixed sample with a proper molar ratio of ZrO 2 and magnesium powder was placed in a tube furnace and then heated with a ramp of 2.5 °C/min and maintained at 650 °C for 4 h in 5% H 2 /Ar atmosphere. After the annealing treatment, the sample was etched for 24 h in 2.0 M HCl solution. Then, the sample was washed with sufficient amount of water to remove the acid, and the removal of Cl -ion was checked by AgNO 3 solution. The washed solid mass was dried at 80 °C for 24 h to obtain black zirconia (BZ). The molar ratio of ZrO 2 and Mg was varied while other experimental conditions was kept the same to get different black ZrO 2-x samples and a trend of color change was observed (Supplementary Figure S1). Unless mentioned with a specific molar ratio of Mg, the BZ prepared with 1:1 molar ratio of ZrO 2 and Mg was analyzed to examine the properties. Furthermore, a set of different samples were prepared (i) in only Ar atmosphere in absence of any H 2 and Mg, (ii) using 5% H 2 /Ar atmosphere in the absence of Mg, and (iii) in the presence of Mg (1 mole ratio with respect to ZrO 2 ) in Ar atmosphere without H 2 at 650 °C for 4 h.Preparation of oxygen-deficient black ZrO 2-x .
