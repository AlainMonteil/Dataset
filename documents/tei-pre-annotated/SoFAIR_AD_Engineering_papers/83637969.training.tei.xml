        <p>The search for suitable catalysts with maximum mass-specific reactivity yet long-term stability has been an everlasting but still formidable challenging topic in catalysis research. Generally, the apparent rate of a surface reaction occurring on a heterogeneous catalyst is strongly dependent on its geometric properties (size, conformation, crystallinity, etc.) and electronic structure (d-band center position, work functions, etc.), which act together in determining adsorption of intermediates, activation energies, and energy barriers for this reaction. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] This complexity hinders the design and selection of the most appropriate catalyst for a specific catalytic reaction. For instance, one catalyst's geometric structure sensitivity can significantly affect its activity toward a specific heterogeneous reaction like the ammonia synthesis over certain iron crystal faces, 5 crystallographic dependence of Fischer-Tropsch process over cobalt catalysts, 6 and nanogold's size dependence of carbon monoxide oxidation. 7 Due to the enormous advances in modern physical chemistry and computational quantum chemistry, an in-depth under-standing of the macroscopic reaction kinetics of catalytic processes at the atomic level can be achieved by correlating reaction rate measurements, spectroscopic characterization, and theoretical calculations. 3,[8][9][10] The importance of this correlation lies in its ability to reveal the nature of the solid catalysts and the origin of their reactivity toward specific catalytic processes. [11][12][13][14] Therefore, one can engineer potential catalysts with desired performance by tailoring their chemical composition and/or physical structure.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen evolution (2H + + 2e -→ H 2 , HER) is an ideal model reaction for introducing the aforementioned advanced methodology to the field of electrocatalysis. HER generates solely the desired product and is being considered as a cornerstone reaction in exploring the mechanism of more complex multielectron transfer processes. 15,16 Practically, HER is also an essential reaction in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for hydrogen production. 17,18 In contrast to the traditional steam reforming of natural gas, the generation of clean hydrogen fuel from water is a potential route toward a sustainable energy future. Although commercial technologies of alkaline electrolysis offer mild conditions and higher system efficiency than acidic proton exchange membrane electrolysis, the reaction rate of HER in alkaline solutions is ∼ 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic solutions. 19 More importantly, in the promising PEC water splitting technology, the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts used as counter electrodes work well only in basic or neutral media. 18,20,21 Therefore, the development of HER catalysts suitable for alkaline solutions is crucial. Currently, the fundamental studies of HER are mainly conducted under acidic conditions due to its relative simple reaction pathway. The activity origin and trend for a wide variety of metallic electrocatalysts have been successfully constructed. 14,16,22,23 However, the overall comprehension of the HER process in alkaline solutions is very limited, mainly on monocrystalline and polycrystalline Pt surfaces. 19,24,25 As a result, the molecular design and practical development of efficient electrocatalysts for this key but sluggish process have been largely hindered. Evidently, Pt shows an "incomparable" HER activity in alkaline solutions, while all well-developed cost-effective alternatives, including high-surface area Raney Ni and nickel molybdenum alloy, still cannot match the activity of Pt. 26,27 However, its scarcity and high cost cannot afford a sustainable hydrogen generation.</p>
        <p>Herein we present the identification of an anomalously structured Ru catalyst, with 1/25 price of Pt metal, that shows 2.5 times higher hydrogen evolution turnover frequency (TOF) under alkaline conditions than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) computation and electrochemical reaction rate measurements were conducted to evaluate the newly developed Ru catalyst by linking its extrinsic crystalline structure with intrinsic reaction energetics in the hydrogen evolution process. Based on the elucidation of poorly known nature of HER in alkaline media, here we reveal for the first time the origin of highest HER activity of this cost-effective catalyst in comparison to all previously reported precious metals, nonprecious metals, and nonmetallic materials.</p>
        <p>■ EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTIONAL METHODS Materials Synthesis. First, a specified amount of diluted RuCl 3 aqueous solution (0.005 M) was mixed with dicyandiamide (DCDA) to make a homogeneous solution; namely, 80 mL of RuCl 3 aqueous solution and 1 g of DCDA solid were used to achieve the resultant Rugraphitic carbon nitride complex supported on carbon (Ru/C 3 N 4 /C) containing ∼20 wt % of metallic Ru (confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis as shown in Figure S1), which is comparable with 20 wt % of metallic Pt in commercial Pt/C benchmark. Then the mixture was concentrated using a rotary evaporator and dried using a freeze-dryer. The collected dark powder was then annealed under argon atmosphere at 600 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min -1 . In the presence of Ru catalyst, most of the DCDA precursor did not follow the rational reaction path of polycondensation to obtain the periodic g-C 3 N 4 matrix but was converted to nitrogen-doped carbon, as confirmed by the carbon K-edge near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) results. Pure Ru supported on carbon (Ru/C) was prepared by mixing 0.005 M RuCl 3 aqueous solution with oxidized commercial carbon black. Then, the mixture was dried and annealed using the same procedure as in the synthesis of Ru/C 3 N 4 /C and used as a control sample. Commercial platinum carbon (Pt/C with 20 wt % Pt), iridium carbon (Ir/C with 20 wt % Ir), palladium carbon (Pd/C with 20 wt % Pd), and gold carbon (Au/C with 20 wt % Au) catalysts were purchased from the Fuel Cell Store without any further treatment.</p>
        <p>Material Characterization. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and electron diffraction patterns were collected on a cubed Titan G2 80-300 field emission gun electron microscope equipped with a Fischione model 3000 high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector and a CEOS GmbH double-hexapole spherical-aberration corrector operating at 300 kV. A probe semiconvergence angle of 24.9 mrad was used for STEM imaging. Some raw HAADF-STEM images were processed by masking diffraction spots in the fast-Fourier transforms of the original images and then back-transforming using a Gatan Digital Micrograph.</p>
        <p>The NEXAFS measurements were carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber (∼10 -10 mbar) of the undulator soft X-ray spectroscopy beamline at the Australian Synchrotron. The samples were dispersed in deionized water and then deposited and dried on Au plates. The raw NEXAFS data were normalized to the photoelectron current of the photon beam, measured on an Au grid. The C K-edge spectra were double corrected to remove the influence from adsorbed carbon on the optics and detector.</p>
        <p>Electrochemical Testing Setup. The as-prepared powder was first ultrasonically dispersed in distilled water (Milli-Q) containing 0.05 wt % of Nafion. Twenty μL of aqueous dispersion of the catalyst (2.0 mg/mL) was then transferred onto the glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE, 0.196 cm 2 , Pine Research Instrumentation) serving as a working electrode. The reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl in 4 M KCl solution, and the counter electrode was a graphite rod. All potentials were referenced to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by using pure hydrogen calibration, and all polarization curves were corrected for the iR contribution within the cell. During experiments a flow of N 2 was maintained over the electrolytes used: 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 , or 0.1 M KOH solution. The working electrode was rotated at 1600 rpm to remove hydrogen gas bubbles formed at the catalyst surface.</p>
        <p>Computational Methods and Models. The electronic structure computation was conducted by using VASP code. [28][29][30][31] To describe the electron-core interaction, the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method was utilized within the frozen-core approximations for Ru and Pt. 32,33 For electron exchange-correlation, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) range was applied. 34,35 The cutoff energies for plane waves were chosen to be 400 eV based on the convergence test on Ru hcp 3 × 3 supercell and 5 × 5 Ru + g-C 3 N 4 supercell. The convergence tolerance of force on each atom during structure relaxation was set to be 0.01 eV/Å, and all atoms were allowed to relax. Spin-polarization effect was considered in all cases. To better describe the dispersion interaction within water adsorption systems, vdW correction was considered by adopting the Grimme's D2 scheme. 36 The parameters for Ru, O, and H are the default values given by VASP 5.3, and those for Pt are C 6 = 4.43 J•nm 6 •mol -1 and R 0 = 1.772 Å. 37 The cutoff radius (Å) for pair interactions among D2 scheme is set to be 20 Å to avoid interactions between different layers, with global scaling factor set to be 0.750 Å. The optimized lattice parameters for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Ru (a = b = 2.73 Å, c = 4.31 Å), face-centered cubic (fcc) Ru (3.82 Å), and fcc Pt (3.97 Å) structures agree well with previous computation studies. [38][39][40][41] The Kpoint for all three metal (1 × 1) single cell, (√3 × √3) reconstructed surface, (1 × 1) g-C 3 N 4 , and (5 × 5) metal with (2 × 2) g-C 3 N 4 was set to be 15 × 15 × 15, 9 × 9 × 1, 5 × 5 × 1, and 1 × 1 × 1, respectively.</p>
        <p>The calculation of adhesion energy between Ru and g-C 3 N 4 was modeled for three layers of Ru slab, one layer of g-C 3 N 4 , and a 16 Å vacuum layer to separate the interaction between periodic images. This supercell structure contains a (5 × 5) lattice of Ru hcp (0001) or Ru fcc (111) primitive cells matched to (2 × 2) lattice of repeating g-C 3 N 4 primitive cells. Three configurations with different relative position between metals and g-C 3 N 4 were investigated, i.e., FCC, HCP, and TOP positions, according to the position of C 6 N 7 rings in g-C 3 N 4 matrix on the top layer of Ru atoms. The calculation of adhesion energy between Ru and carbon was modeled by three layers of (1 × 1) Ru hcp (0001) or Ru fcc (111) and one layer of (1 × 1) graphene to represent carbon black. Similarly, three relative configurations were studied due to the lattice mismatch between Ru and graphene, as in the previous work. 42 More computational details about free energy diagram, water dissociation pathway, and H 2 recombination pathway can be found in the Supporting Information.</p>
        <p>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structural Identification. The as-synthesized Ru/C 3 N 4 /C product shows a homogeneous dispersion of Ru nanoparticles with an average size of 2 nm on the g-C 3 N 4 /C support (Figure S2). Note that we did not carry out the conventional synthesis of precious metal nanoparticles involving bulky capping, structure-directing, or reducing agents, etc. The formation of homogeneous particle size of Ru was achieved by taking advantage of strong interaction (discussed later) between Ru metal and g-C 3 N 4 support that has a periodically regular molecular structure. The HAADF-STEM images provide more structural information about these Ru nanoparticles (Figure 1a,c,e). Normally, the majority of metals show only its most stable crystalline structure: either a fcc, a body centered cubic (bcc), or a hcp structure. The structure transition can only be achieved under some extreme conditions, e.g., temperature and/or pressure and may lead to some unique electrical, magnetic, and catalytic properties as compared with the most stable structures under ambient conditions. [43][44][45] Ru as a 4d transition-metal possesses an hcp structure, as reported in most experimental and theoretical studies. [46][47][48] Interestingly, the typical atomic resolution HAADF-STEM images of individual Ru nanoparticles in Ru/C 3 N 4 /C catalyst were used to unambiguously identify a typical [100] f oriented fcc monophase, a [110] f /[112̅ 0] h oriented intergrown hcp/fcc phase sharing the (0001) h /(111) f interface, and a [0001] h oriented hcp monophase, respectively. These results are further supported by the indexed fast Fourier transform (FFT) diffractograms (Figure 1b,d,f) and high-resolution TEM images (Figure S3). In addition, in comparison with a Ru/C control sample that only demonstrates hcp Ru crystal on the electron diffraction patterns (Figure S4), Ru/C 3 N 4 /C shows an extra intensity at ∼7.3 nm -1 that can be assigned to the (022) reflection of the fcc Ru crystal. Given the difference between two materials is the existence of g-C 3 N 4 , 49 we assume that g-C 3 N 4 as the support allows for the growth of the anomalous fcc Ru lattice structure. Similarly to the Kitagawa et al. report on the formation of multiply twinned Ru particles based on the "nanosize" effect, 46 our study shows clearly that the anomalous Ru structures exist in the case of small nanosized particles confined by the g-C 3 N 4 phase.</p>
        <p>Adhesion Energy Calculation. To validate the above assumption, the DFT calculated adhesion energies (ΔE adh ) between two specific Ru nanostructures and g-C 3 N 4 substrate were used to quantitatively describe the formation mechanism of anomalous Ru crystalline structure (Figures 2a andS5 and Table S1). For comparison purposes, the values of ΔE adh between Ru and pure carbon layer represented by graphene were also computed (Figure S6 and Table S1). For standalone Ru slabs, the hcp structure is more stable than the fcc one with an energy difference of 0.06 eV per Ru atom, which is in good agreement with previous experimental observations. [46][47][48] Conversely, as shown in Figure 2b (dashed bars), the ΔE adh calculated for fcc structured Ru (Ru fcc ) on the g-C 3 N 4 substrate is nearly 4 eV (0.15 eV per Ru atom on the top layer) higher than that of hcp structured Ru (Ru hcp ), confirming the stabilizing effect of g-C 3 N 4 toward formation of Ru fcc achieved by enhanced metal-substrate interactions. On the other hand, such tendency was not observed in the case of a carbon substrate, on which the Ru hcp structure is more energetically favorable than Ru fcc as indicated by a larger ΔE adh (Figure 2b solid bars). Thus, g-C 3 N 4 acts as a promoter that can facilitate the formation of anomalous fcc crystalline Ru structure. This theoretically predicted result agrees with the experimental data showing that there is a certain amount of fcc crystalline Ru in the Ru/C 3 N 4 /C composite, while only a sole hcp phase exists in the Ru/C control sample (Figure S4). Besides crystalline, the rich functional groups in g-C 3 N 4 molecular skeleton (e.g., triazine, amine, etc.) may also modulate the growth of Ru nanoparticles, resulting in a more uniform distribution and smaller size than those grown on clean carbon surfaces (Figure S2).</p>
        <p>Chemical Characteristics of Ru/C 3 N 4 /C. NEXAFS spectroscopy was used to precisely detect intramolecular interactions between Ru and g-C 3 N 4 , as demonstrated by the DFT calculations. In the C K-edge region (Figure 3a), the Ru/ These new nitrogen resonances can be assigned to the interaction of Ru with bridging N-3C species of g-C 3 N 4 with different coordination. As a result, nitrogen atoms accept extra charges from Ru atom, resulting in a negative shift in its photon energy profile.</p>
        <p>Electrocatalytic Activity Comparison. The electrocatalytic properties of the newly identified Ru/C 3 N 4 /C electrocatalyst were evaluated and compared to the conventional Ru/ C and the state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions. The polarization curves of three electrocatalysts recorded in 0.1 M KOH solution show an increase in the HER activity (on the overpotential basis) in the following order: Ru/ C &lt; Pt/C &lt; Ru/C 3 N 4 /C (Figure 4a). The normalized (with respect to the electrode's geometrical area) exchange current density (j 0 ) values obtained from Tafel plots also follow the same trend (Figure 4b). As read from Figure 4a, a small overpotential of 79 mV was required for achieving a 10 mA cm -2 cathodic current density (such current density was chosen as a metrics for the comparison with solar hydrogen production) by the Ru/C 3 N 4 /C sample. This value is not only much smaller than that for some nonprecious metal HER electrocatalysts like WC, 50 Ni 2 P, 51 Mo 2 C 52 but also, more strikingly, superior as compared to the values obtained for all reported pure and nanostructured precious metals like Pt, 53 Au, 53,54 Ir, 53 Pd, 54 and Ru itself 53 under the same conditions (Figures 4c andS7a). We note that the performances of individual metal-free components g-C 3 N 4 , N-carbon, and their hybrid are ignorable as compared with a Ru-containing catalyst, Ru/C 3 N 4 /C (Figure S8); therefore, a significant enhancement in its activity in comparison to that of the Ru/C control sample can be solely attributed to the presence of anomalous fcc crystalline Ru nanoparticles.</p>
        <p>TOF Analysis. To eliminate the contributions originating from different particle sizes and surface areas of electrocatalysts to the measured HER activity, we calibrated the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the newly developed Ru/ C 3 N 4 /C and a series of precious metal electrocatalysts by a well-established cyclic voltammetry method (Figure S9), which has been successfully validated on Ru electrodes surfaces. 55,56 Afterward, the TOF, the best figure-of-merit used for comparative evaluation of the catalytic activities of different catalysts, can be explicitly calculated based on the current density obtained from the polarization curve. As expected,the TOF value increases with the overpotential following the Tafel behavior for all samples. As shown in Figure 4d, at an overpotential of 100 mV, the Ru/C 3 N 4 /C electrocatalyst exhibits an extremely high TOF of 4.2 s -1 , which is larger than that of most commercial precious metal/carbon nanocomposites. Note that the price of Ru metal is at least 10 times cheaper than other precious metals, which is advantageous for the large-scale commercialization in the future (Table S2). Moreover, the TOF value obtained for Ru/C 3 N 4 /C was also compared with other benchmarked electrocatalysts: it is 60 times larger than that on Ni 5 P 4 catalyst (0.06 s -1 ), 57 80 times larger than that on Ni-Mo catalyst (0.05 s -1 ), 27 and most importantly, 2.5 times larger than that on currently the most active Pt/C catalyst under the same conditions (Figure 4e). Additionally, the strong interactions of Ru nanoparticles with g-C 3 N 4 /C support, as confirmed by both experimental and theoretical studies, prevent its aggregation during long-term reaction. This assures high HER operational stability of the Ru/ C 3 N 4 /C electrocatalyst in alkaline solutions with a very slow attenuation after 50 h (Figure 4f). The accelerated durability test (ADT) also revealed its reliable stability with a very small negative shift of the HER polarization after 1000 continuous potential cycles (Figure 4f inset).</p>
        <p>Crystal Structure Sensitivity in Electrocatalysis under Different Conditions. As shown in Figure 5a, Ru/C 3 N 4 /C also is applicable under acidic conditions, in which the activity is higher than in alkaline solutions. This trend also agrees with other reports on Pt/C materials. 21,24 The activity differences in acid and alkaline solutions can be attributed to the nature of the reaction pathway in each type of solution, which will be discussed in detail later. Additionally, the TOF values of Ru/ C 3 N 4 /C are always higher than that of the Ru/C control sample under the same conditions (Figure 5a,b). This trend is more obvious at high pH values than at low pH values. For example, the TOF difference between Ru/C 3 N 4 /C and Ru/C in acidic solutions is 0.38 s -1 at an overpotential of 100 mV (0.05 s -1 at an overpotential of 50 mV), while this value is as large as 2.25 s -1 at an overpotential of 100 mV (0.45 s -1 at an overpotential of 50 mV) in alkaline solutions. Given that the most noticeable difference between these two kinds of catalysts is the crystalline structure of Ru (after ECSA normalization), we attribute the observed difference in the catalytic activities to the Ru crystal structure sensitivity under different testing conditions.</p>
        <p>The lattice structure-induced enhancement in the catalytic activity under specific conditions is also reflected between Pt/C and Ru/C 3 N 4 /C samples. Judged from both overpotential and TOF bases, Ru/C 3 N 4 /C shows smaller HER activity than that of Pt/C under acid conditions while reversely shows better activity under alkaline conditions (Figure 5c,d). As can be also seen, the activity differences for Ru/C 3 N 4 /C electrocatalyst in acid and alkaline solutions are small, which is rarely observed on other electrocatalysts because the reaction rate of HER in alkaline solutions is usually ∼2-3 orders of magnitude lower than that in acidic solutions (for example, on Pt surface). 21 Therefore, we assume the reversible activity trend in acid and alkaline solutions should be attributed to some critical but unknown factor(s) that govern the overall reaction rate on each electrocatalyst surface.</p>
        <p>Origin of the Enhanced Activity of Ru/C 3 N 4 /C. We performed DFT computations related to the thermodynamics and kinetics of HER on different metal surfaces to reveal the observed activity difference and the origin of the superior activity of Ru/C 3 N 4 /C in alkaline solutions (Figure 6). Ru slabs with both Ru hcp (0001) and Ru fcc (111) planes were modeled to represent conventional Ru in Ru/C and the newly identified anomalous Ru in Ru/C 3 N 4 /C sample, respectively; a Pt slab with (111) plane that represents the Pt/C sample was also studied for the purpose of comparison. 13,47 Even though the computed structured surfaces cannot fully represent the experimentally synthesized metal nanoparticles with various facets, corners, and edges, these specific planes were selected because they are among the most commonly observed and most respective ones in both experiments and theoretical modeling studies. 14,47,58 On all selected metal surfaces, we constructed the reaction pathway for HER including bilayer adsorption of H 2 O, dissociation of water to form adsorbed H (H*), combination of H* with proton from adjacent H 2 O to form adsorbed H 2 , and desorption of H 2 from the surface. 21 As shown in Figure 6a, among all three metal surfaces, Pt shows the optimal level for H adsorption step with a free energy (ΔG H* Pt ) value of -0.02 eV, while Ru hcp and Ru fcc surface exhibit more negative values with ΔG H* Ru-hcp = -0.83 eV and ΔG H* Ru-fcc = -0.48 eV, respectively. Therefore, from the thermodynamic point of view, Pt should demonstrate the best hydrogen evolution activity among these three metal structures. The calculated ΔG H* values on the respective metal surfaces can be correlated with their electronic structures via the d-band center theory to reveal the origin of their reactivity (Figure S10). 59 The general trend is that with a low position d-band, such as in the case of Pt, the hydrogen adsorption is weak; while for a metal with a higher d-band position, such as Ru hcp , the hydrogen binding is strong thus resulting in a more negative ΔG H* and is not thermodynamically favorable for the H* desorption process in the Heyrovsky step.</p>
        <p>However, the above theoretical investigation based only on adsorption energetics can hardly meet with the experimental observation: comparing with Pt/C, a larger j 0 value was observed on the Ru/C 3 N 4 /C sample, which is represented by the Ru fcc slab with a relatively stronger H* adsorption (Figure 6b).When the kinetics of water dissociation from the Volmer step is considered, as shown in Figure 6a (curved lines), the Pt surface exhibits a significant energy barrier (ΔG B = 0.94 eV), substantively higher than that on Ru fcc (ΔG B = 0.41 eV) and Ru hcp (ΔG B = 0.51 eV) (Table 3, Figure S11, 12). Therefore, from the kinetic viewpoint, conversely, Pt demonstrates the most sluggish water dissociation among the three metal structures studied. Note that this water dissociation issue does not exist under acidic conditions; 14 therefore Pt shows an extremely high activity in acid solutions, owing to its optimal ΔG H* value. We conducted further computation work to obtain energy barrier values for the following H 2 formation process by Heyrovsky mechanism on Ru surfaces. As shown in Figure S13, the energy barrier for Heyrovsky step on Ru fcc is 0.48 eV while that on Ru hcp is 0.40 eV (Figure S13). These easily surmountable barrier values indicate that the Heyrovsky step is kinetically viable and does not serve as the limiting step for the overall reaction.</p>
        <p>Regarding the overall HER rate, it is generally accepted that ΔG H* could be employed to obtain the HER rate in acidic solutions based on the microkinetic model. 14 This has also been validated by our computation done for selected models and by measurements performed on the synthesized electrocatalysts (Figure S14). However, with the identification of large energy barrier-like water dissociation on the Pt surface, the ΔG H* value alone is hardly sufficient to describe the apparent HER activity in alkaline solutions. In this case, besides the formation of the H* state, the water dissociation kinetics would also affect the overall reaction rate leading to the experimentally observed activity trend (Figure 6b). At this stage, association of the classical microkinetic model (applying ΔG H* as an activity descriptor) with the newly considered transition-state theory (applying ΔG B as an activity descriptor) gives a qualitative confirmation of the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen evolution in alkaline solutions on Pt/C electrocatalysts, and more importantly, explains the underlying mechanism of the better catalytic activity of Ru fcc present in Ru/C 3 N 4 /C electrocatalysts.</p>
        <p>Using hydrogen evolution as a probe reaction, we correlated the apparent catalytic activity of a cost-effective but highly efficient Ru electrocatalyst with its anomalous crystalline structure and inherent reaction energetics. By identifying the significant influence of water dissociation on the overall HER activity of different metal surfaces, we elucidated the poorly studied HER process in alkaline media through the association of the classical microkinetic model with the transition-state theory. Both experimental data and theoretical computation demonstrate that a special kind of carbon-based material (e.g., g-C 3 N 4 ) can induce an anomalous crystalline structure of a transition metal (e.g., Ru) with having very high catalytic activity. Therefore, this study opens a new avenue for the design of a wide variety of solid catalysts for broader heterogeneous and electrocatalytic applications.</p>
