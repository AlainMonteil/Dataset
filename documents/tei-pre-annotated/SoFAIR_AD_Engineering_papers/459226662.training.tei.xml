        <p>In the current scenario of energy transition, there is a need for efficient, safe and affordable batteries as a key technology to facilitate the ambitious goals set by the European Commission in the recently launched Green Deal [1]. The bloom of renewable energies, in an attempt to confront climate change, requires stationary electrochemical energy storage [2] for effective integration of sustainably generated electrical energy. Indeed, the inclusion of 20% renewables might be sufficient to destabilize the grid due to their intermittent nature [3].In the current scenario of energy transition, there is a need for efficient, safe and affordable batteries as a key technology to facilitate the ambitious goals set by the European Commission in the recently launched Green Deal [1].

        <p>The global Energy Transition scenario implies large scale considerations when defining a solution. Lithium Ion Batteries (LIBs) are ubiquitous in our society and dominate the energy storage market powering portable devices, EVs and even smart grid facilities. In 2019, 8.8 GWh of LIB capacity were installed for stationary energy storage vs. 0.25 GWh of Redox Flow Batteries (RFBs). However, its high maintenance cost and safety limitations, in addition to the limited availability of lithium, note the interest in developing alternatives to efficiently store energy.The global Energy Transition scenario implies large scale considerations when defining a solution.

        <p>Large-scale grid storage requires long life-low cost batteries, considering both cyclability, calendar life, and round-trip efficiency. Installation and maintenance costs are still the main barriers for penetration of storage on the grid. Thus, clear targets have been set in the SET Plan, for stationary energy storage in terms of cost (0.05 € kW -1 h -1 cycle -1 ) and durability (10,000 cycles and 20 years lifetime) for 2030 [4].Large-scale grid storage requires long life-low cost batteries, considering both cyclability, calendar life, and round-trip efficiency.

        <p>RFBs have emerged as relevant candidates to address the sustainable energy generation. Their unique capability to decouple power and energy based on their particular architecture results in advantages such as: flexible modular design and operation, excellent scalability, moderate maintenance costs and long-life cycling. Thus, the system consists of three main components: energy storage tanks, stack of electrochemical cells and the flow system. Fig. 1 shows an archetypical redox flow battery, e.g. Vanadium redox flow battery (VRB or VRFB).RFBs have emerged as relevant candidates to address the sustainable energy generation.

        <p>The energy storage proceeds as follows: 1) active species are contained in the tanks as a solution with a certain energy density, 2) the solution, defined as electrolyte, is pumped into the stack, where the electrochemical conversion takes place and collected back in the tanks. The size of the stack defines the power of the system whilst the amount of electrolyte stored in the tanks states the total energy.The energy storage proceeds as follows: 1) active species are contained in the tanks as a solution with a certain energy density, 2) the solution, defined as electrolyte, is pumped into the stack, where the electrochemical conversion takes place and collected back in the tanks.

        <p>Alternatively to the standard RFBs, systems comprising at least one solid electroactive material that is deposited or stripped within the stack, have been widely explored (e.g. Zn based RFBs). Those, so called hybrid RFBs, differ from the previous type in their capability to decouple power and energy, which is limited by the solid electrode (Fig. 2). Hereafter, RFBs that store electroactive material only in outer tanks and flown through the cell in its reduced and oxidized states will be termed pure flow RFBs.Alternatively to the standard RFBs, systems comprising at least one solid electroactive material that is deposited or stripped within the stack, have been widely explored (e.g. Zn based RFBs).

        <p>Excellent reviews have already covered in depth the chemistry, components and performance of RFBs [5][6][7][8][9]. This review does not intend to cover detailed information on components, though in many cases the chemistry of the electrolyte, as the main component, will serve to distinguish and classify developed RFB technologies. Equally, no system integration aspects will be detailed due to the lack of maturity of the presented alternatives. The overall purpose of this review is to examine technologies that can potentially fulfill cost requirements and enable large scale storage. In that sense, subsequent sections will be focused, with limited exceptions, on aqueous systems based on their technical and economic advantages. After a short overview of the State of the art of industrialized flow batteries for both pure flow and hybrid RFBs, the status of less mature technologies will be described in sections 3-5. Following the classification defined in section 2, Alternatives for pure flow/flow batteries and Alternatives for hybrid flow/non-flow batteries will be covered separately in sections 3 and 4 respectively. Section 5 is devoted to recent and unexplored RFBs and/or disruptive technologies that go beyond standard RFB configuration as defined in this section, i.e. solar redox-flow batteries.Excellent reviews have already covered in depth the chemistry, components and performance of RFBs [5][6][7][8][9].

        <p>In the last few decades, RFBs have been studied and developed based on different chemistries. Among them, the most successful is the allvanadium RFB, which has reached effective commercial fruition starting in the 1980s [10]. The Vanitec website lists 26 companies as producers of this technology [11] and several plants have been installed globally [12]. Among the largest are the Minami Hayakita Substation in Japan, rated 15 MW and 60 MWh and built by Sumitomo Electric Ind. for Hokkaido Electric Power Inc. in 2015, and the energy storage station at Fraunhofer ICT in Pfinztal, Germany, rated 2 MW and 20 MWh and commissioned in 2019, while UniEnergy Technologies, US-WA, has installed a number of systems rated 2 MW and 8 MWh. The largest project so far is the 200 MW 800 MWh Storage Station designed by Rongke Power of China. When completed it will be by far the largest electrochemical energy storage plant in the world.In the last few decades, RFBs have been studied and developed based on different chemistries.

        <p>In such a well-established technology, efforts are devoted to improve efficiency and increase defined current and power densities. The typical current density of commercial VRBs is in the order of 80-100 mA cm -2 and correspondingly the power density barely reaches 100 mW cm -2 , i. e. much less than equivalent proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

        <p>Thanks to the fast electrochemical kinetics, the response time is very short, in the order of a millisecond, if the electrodes are kept full of electrolytes and pumps in standby promptly take over. This allows VRFBs to respond immediately to surge power demand from the grid, coping with power quality grid services such as sag compensation and frequency regulation [23,24]. The electrolytes which remain inside the electrodes in standby also allow overcurrents of 150% and more in the first few milliseconds after insertion, before concentration gradients take over [18].Thanks to the fast electrochemical kinetics, the response time is very short, in the order of a millisecond, if the electrodes are kept full of electrolytes and pumps in standby promptly take over.

        <p>Back to the beginning, RFBs were conceived based on the use of metal redox couples as active material for the electrolyte. High stability at different oxidation states and good redox kinetics are identified as key parameters for the success of metal ions as redox active materials. Some of those, although proposed several decades ago, are still subject of study (V, Fe, Ce). In addition, the use of inorganic species has been extended to several other compounds (e.g. halides, sulfides, hydrogen or oxygen) that have been coupled with metal ions or employed independently as in the case of hydrogen-bromine flow batteries (HBFBs). Some of the technologies that aim to dare all-vanadium's supremacy are discussed in this section.Back to the beginning, RFBs were conceived based on the use of metal redox couples as active material for the electrolyte.

        <p>Vanadium-oxygen RFBs have been derived from VRFBs by replacing the positive half-cell with an air electrode, with the advantages that: the energy density is increased, the needed quantity of vanadium is reduced, V(V) is avoided together with the risk of its precipitation at high temperature. Only tested at small scale, so far, these cells are often referred to as V/O fuel cells (VOFCs), due to the lack of reversibility in the positive electrode.

The VOFC maximum discharge power density was 30 mW cm -2 . Hosseiny et al. reported a VO cell that they dubbed vanadium-air redox-flow battery (VARFB) and used two MEAs, one for charging and one for discharging, with titanium/iridium catalyst and platinum/carbon catalyst, respectively [50]. The negative electrolyte was a 2 M V(II)/V(III) solution in 3 M H 2 SO 4 and the charge and discharge current density was 2.4 mA cm -2 . Due to the absence of V(V), and therefore precipitation, they operated the VARFB with 4 M V(II) and V(III) at temperature as high as 80 • C without damaging the membrane. An energy efficiency of 45.7% was achieved. However, a reduction of the OCV in time was observed, due to self-discharge and possibly to oxygen crossover.In 2010 Noack et al. published an experimental comparison between a VOFC and a VRFB [49].

To counteract this issue, Noack et al. developed a cell with two membranes and an intermediate compartment [52], where diffusing V(II) was oxidized to V(III), thus preventing hydrogen formation at the Pt particles of the MEA.In 2011 Palminteri et al. observed that the diffusion of the V(II) solution into the positive compartment caused a strong hydrogen evolution in the Pt-based MEA.

The chemistry behind this Tiron molecule is the redox equilibrium between quinone/hydroquinone couple, which is known to undergo fast 2e -transfer. The use of those, so named as quinoids, has been widely explored as both anolyte and catholyte materials.The use of organic molecules in RFBs dates back to 2010 when Xu et al.

        <p>Aziz et al. introduced the use of anthraquinones as anolytes in acid media (2,7-AQDS E • 0 = 0.213 V vs SHE) coupled with a bromine based catholyte [89]. The AQDS/Br flow battery delivered a 0.8 V OCV and the highly conductive acid electrolyte allowed to reach excellent peak power density &gt;0.6 W cm -2 . However, a high crossover rate of bromine resulted in low CE values (95%). Later on, the system efficiency was improved by membrane modification diminishing the crossover (98.35% CE) (Table 1, entry 1) [90]. 2,7-AQDS showed good stability and compatibility with bromine allowed for efficient charge/discharged for 750 cycles.Aziz et al. introduced the use of anthraquinones as anolytes in acid media (2,7-AQDS E • 0 = 0.213 V vs SHE) coupled with a bromine based catholyte [89].

        <p>Independently Narayanan et al. [91] reported AQS/BQDS all-organic quinone AORFBs in sulfuric acid as supporting electrolyte. The use quinone/hydroquinone couple delivers low cell voltages (&lt;0.7 V) and low capacity retention (ca. 90% for 12 cycles). In addition, the anticipated instability of Tiron [88] was confirmed as it underwent Michael type side reactions. Other related alternatives have failed to render efficient AORFBs [92,93]. Very recently, Narayanan has developed an inexpensive system based on coupling 2,7-AQDS with FeSO 4 (47 € kW -1 h -1 ) (Table 1 entry 2) [94]. Even if this battery is clearly outperformed by already developed electrolytes pairs in some aspects as cell voltage (0.62 V), this system stands as a cost-effective candidate in terms of energy cost. Other negative aspects of the system can be listed as: the need for operating with mixed electrolyte to avoid crossover and high power related costs.Independently Narayanan et al.

        <p>In 2015, Aziz et al. [95] adapted the quinone based system to alkaline media. The introduction of -OH groups in 2,6-DHAQ resulted in a highly soluble (&gt;0.6 M) anolyte at pH 14 with significant decrease in the redox potential (E 0 = -0.684 V vs SHE). When paired with hexacyanoferrate an OCV of 1.2 V at SoC 50%, 84% EE at 100 mA cm -2 and 0.45 W cm -2 power density were reported. However, 2,6-DHAQ [96] has been identified as unstable compounds under these conditions. In fact, quinones are more prone to form reactive anion radicals above pH 9 [91]. More stable DHAQ derivatives, 2,6-DBEAQ [97] and 2,6-DPPEAQ [98] were efficiently employed in milder pH media, 12 and 9 respectively, decreasing the degradation rate (0.001% cycle -1 ) of anthraquinones (Table 1, entries 3-4). AQDS salts [99,100] and alternative AQDS derivatives [101] have recently been proposed for neutral AQ-based RFBs. Although ferrocyanide was initially suggested to be highly unstable in alkaline media [102], a recent study [103] showed that charge unbalancing due to oxygen evolution reaction was the source of the capacity fading previously observed, and ferrocyanide is indeed stable.In 2015, Aziz et al.

        <p>Inspired by redox mediators as phenazine and flavin cofactors, different structures have been proposed as anolyte [106][107][108][109][110] and catholytes [111] for redox flow batteries. Mainly employed as anolytes in alkaline AORFBs, present high solubility, high capacity (&gt;90% material utilization) and outstanding stability.

        <p>Methyl viologen (MV), considered as archetypical 4,4' substituted bipyridine, was firstly applied by Wang and Liu [112] in RFBs. This compound can undergo 1 or 2e -reduction processes, where the second electron transfer is defined as non-reversible. In this case, unlike the quinone/hydroquinone all-organic AORFBs, catholyte and anolyte present different chemical identity, for instance, a nitroxyl radical and a viologen respectively. TEMPO is a stable radical that can undergo fast reversible redox transformation to corresponding oxoammonium salt. Recently, Aziz and Yang [115] reported a BTMAP-Vi/TMAP-TEMPO AORFB. Molecular engineering applied in this work, has served to boost both solubility (≥2 M) and stability (99.985% capacity retention cycle -1 for over 250 cycles employing 1.5 M solution of active materials) of both electrolytes while maintaining the cell voltage (1.19 V vs SHE) (Table 1, entry 7). However, TEMPO derivative still shows significant degradation over time (0.026% h -1 ).

        <p>The strategy of using redox active polymers based electrolytes is based on the maxima of developing cost-efficient redox flow batteries. The large size of those molecules is intended to be enough to completely suppress crossover and thus maintain high CE values and mitigate any capacity fading related to this phenomenon, e.g. side reactions. Moreover, the already mentioned size of the active material allows replacing standard membranes by low-cost pore size exclusion separators. Membranes are responsible of providing the ionic conductivity between half cells and contribute significantly to the overall ASR, even more as a result of aging. Commodity polymers, such as polypropylene, or inorganic materials, as silica, employed as separators would serve to decrease the cost of the cell.The strategy of using redox active polymers based electrolytes is based on the maxima of developing cost-efficient redox flow batteries.

        <p>Schubert et al. were pioneer on the field when his group developed a viologen-based copolymer for the anolyte and a TEMPO-based copolymer for the catholyte [126]. Those highly water-soluble polymers have acceptable viscosity values of 5 and 17 cP respectively (at theoretical specific capacity of 10 A h L -1 ). The poly(viologen)/poly (TEMPO-co-METAC) RFB delivered 74.5% of theoretical capacity at mA cm -2 . A capacity retention of 99.76% cycle -1 over 95 cycles was recorded. More recently, the same group reported a redox active polymer with zwitterionic nature [127]. The introduction of this group allowed to reach solubilities equal to 20 A h L -1 in 1 M NaCl (ca. mM). The zwitterionic polymer was paired with MV as anolyte to provide 1.32 V cell voltage for a theoretical 10 A h L -1 capacity. The cell delivered 5.33 Wh L -1 at 8 mA cm -2 over 125 cycles corresponding to an 87.5% of the theoretical energy density. A capacity retention of 99.71% cycle -1 and 99% CE was obtained. In this case the water crossover due to osmotic pressure previously reported [128], was compensated by adding more water on the catholyte. The use of polymeric electrolytes has to face great challenges inherent to the use of high molecular weight compounds, as the low solubility, sluggish/poor reaction kinetics and high viscosity. However, this area remains unexplored and new achievements are still to come.Schubert et al. were pioneer on the field when his group developed a viologen-based copolymer for the anolyte and a TEMPO-based copolymer for the catholyte [126].

        <p>Regardless of the chemical nature of the redox material, most of the above mentioned RFB examples rely on expensive and poor performing ion-selective membranes to keep positive and negative electrolytes physically separated but ionically connected.

The use of low-cost size exclusion membranes or separators (e.g. PRFB) has been covered in previous sections. A more ambitious strategy to achieve cost effective RFBs relies on complete removal of the physical barrier between electrolytes. To date, there are only two strategies to eliminate membranes in RFBs, i) microfluidic batteries relying on hydrodynamic engineering to exploit the laminar flow of electrolytes and ii) biphasic batteries using immiscible redox electrolytes that are separated by thermodynamic principles [141] (Fig. 5).Regardless of the chemical nature of the redox material, most of the above mentioned RFB examples rely on expensive and poor performing ion-selective membranes to keep positive and negative electrolytes physically separated but ionically connected.

        <p>The first approach is based on the stream of electrolytes (mostly vanadium based) flowing through parallel micro-channels under laminar flux, which minimizes electrolyte mixing [142][143][144][145][146][147][148][149] under the adequate fluidodynamic conditions. In these microdevices, power density, which ranges from 40 mW cm -2 employing flow-by electrodes [143] to up to 750 mW cm -2 for optimized flow-through electrodes [147], is mainly limited by the low flow rates that are necessary to maintain the laminar flow and reduce the electrolyte mixing. In fact, reactant crossover/cross-contamination and self-discharge, always present in these co-laminar microbatteries, are responsible for the low columbic efficiencies (&lt;40%) and low reactant conversion (&lt;20%) that limit the practical use of this technology [146]. Experimental and simulation contributions in microfluidic fuel cells have demonstrated certain mitigation of diffusive mixing while enhancing active species transport to the electrode by modifying the cell architecture, e.g. by using H-shape cross-sectional [150] or bridge-shape cross-sectional microchannels [151] or by designing optimized herringbone-inspired microstructures [152,153]. However, in all those cases the fabrication complexity increases significantly whereas crossover issue is not significantly reduced. It is important to mention that only few of those reported microfluidic electrochemical devices have been designed with a dual pass [147,148,154] instead of single pass [144] architecture making possible further electrolyte recirculation and thus battery recharging that, however, has not been demonstrated to date. Moreover, all these examples have been developed at the microscale providing much smaller power densities than their membrane-based counterparts. With single cell power output in the 10 mW range, the targeted application for co-laminar cells will be quite different from the high power conventional VRFBs with a typical 14-cell stack producing on the order of 1 kW. Therefore, their scalability is limited by the compulsory microfluidic design which restricts their practical applications to a series of commodities and small power utilities.The first approach is based on the stream of electrolytes (mostly vanadium based) flowing through parallel micro-channels under laminar flux, which minimizes electrolyte mixing [142][143][144][145][146][147][148][149] under the adequate fluidodynamic conditions.

        <p>A novel concept of Membrane-Free Battery that is not constrained to microscale design principles but based on the immiscibility of redox electrolytes has been recently explored. In the first proof-of-concept membrane-free battery reported by Navalpotro et al. [155], the biphasic system was formed by one acidic solution and one ionic liquid, both containing quinoid species. This pioneering battery which was tested in static mode exhibited an open circuit voltage of 1.4 V, a stable discharge plateau at 0.9 V and a power density of 1.98 mW cm -2 , being able to operate during several cycles. The versatility of this concept was demonstrated by using different aqueous-nonaqueous immiscible electrolytes (neutral aqueous, butanone, propylene carbonate, etc.) and different redox organic molecules (anthraquinones, TEMPOs) [156].

        <p>The versatility of this concept has been recently expanded to aqueous-aqueous immiscible systems constituting more sustainable, more environmentally friendly, less toxic and less expensive battery chemistry [158,159]. In these cases, the aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) were formed from a ternary mixture of water and two phase-forming components such as different ionic liquids/Na 2 SO 4 [158] and poly (ethylene glycol)/Na 2 SO 4 [159]. Different from conventional RFB, where crossover is governed by the effectiveness of the ion-selective membrane, in these membrane-free batteries the crossover is determined by thermodynamics, specifically by the partition coefficients of active species. Methyl viologen and TEMPO were selected as the negative and positive redox species on account to their appropriate partition coefficient and redox potential. This Total Aqueous Membrane-Free Battery exhibited an OCV of 1.23 V, peak power density of 23 mW cm -2 , much higher than the nonaqueous-aqueous immiscible battery, and excellent long-cycling performance under static conditions. Although the crossover or cross-contamination can be suppressed by choosing species with adequate partitioning, the self-discharge at the interface is inherent to this technology and constitutes one of the most important challenges. Another important challenge is the operation of the battery under flowing conditions since commonly used filter press reactors are not appropriate here. Therefore, alternative reactor designs should be developed in near future to demonstrate if this membrane-free approach might become a real alternative.The versatility of this concept has been recently expanded to aqueous-aqueous immiscible systems constituting more sustainable, more environmentally friendly, less toxic and less expensive battery chemistry [158,159].

        <p>Energy density of a conventionally designed RFB scales with solubility of the electroactive species employed, which is typically in the range of 1-2 M. On the other hand, the concentration of active centers in solid materials varies between 20 and 50 M. As a consequence, the energy density of "static" batteries based on solid active materials (e.g. Nickel-Metal Hydrides) largely surpasses the values achieved for RFBs. Instead of searching for a gradual increment in energy density by increasing the solubility, the use of solid active materials in a flowing system opens up the possibility of achieving unprecedented values for RFBs. In other words, battery technologies resulting from combining a flowing configuration and solid active materials shall possess two incompatible battery features, i.e. decoupled energy and power scalability and high energy density. Two main approaches (Fig. 6) have been proposed to realize this desired combination: a) the Semi-Solid Flow Battery and b) the Solid Targeted/Mediated/Boosted Flow Battery.

        <p>Electrolyte containing soluble active species is replaced by a suspension of solid particles that forms a slurry or also called a semi-solid electrode. The solid-containing slurry is stored in an external reservoir and pumped into the electrochemical reactor for energy conversion (Fig. 6a).

Working prototypes of SSFBs using flowable suspensions having up to ≈12 M concentration were shown. This concept was extended to other battery chemistries based on non-aqueous electrolytes [160,163,164] and aqueous electrolytes [165][166][167], as well as organic particulate materials [168] and capacitive materials [169]. The main limitation regarding the use of solid active materials developed for static batteries is the new role of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which turns from being a blessing in static batteries to a curse in SSFBs [170]. The SEI severs electrical connection between current collector and solid active particles so that the use of materials operating below 0.7 V vs Li/Li + becomes very challenging.Electrolyte containing soluble active species is replaced by a suspension of solid particles that forms a slurry or also called a semi-solid electrode.

        <p>The use of suspensions of solid particles requires changes in the system architecture of a conventional RFBs. In particular, the reactor design should allow solid particles to flow through it. High surface area porous 3-D carbonaceous electrodes must be avoided due to the risk of clogging by the suspended particles. A typical cell reactor for SSFB is composed of two current collectors, a separator and gaskets. A space, through which a slurry will flow, is defined by gaskets [162]. The maximum current density for "flat" 2-D electrodes is drastically reduced due to the low electrochemical surface area. Carbon particles are added into the suspension of active particles to provide the slurry with electrical conductivity and thus increase the electrochemical surface area when the slurry flows through the reactor. The higher carbon content, the higher electrical conductivity and the higher current density. Unfortunately, i) the current density is still much lower than that achieved in conventional RFB configuration and ii) the viscosity and ionic resistance increase with increasing content of carbon as well, so that a compromise value of carbon content must be found. The use of surfactants, e.g. Triton X-100 and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), as dispersing agents in the semi-solid electrodes was shown to improve the properties of semi-solid electrodes since this type of additive increases flowability enabling further increase in carbon content [171,172].The use of suspensions of solid particles requires changes in the system architecture of a conventional RFBs.

        <p>The use of a conventional RFB architecture is only possible when the solid active materials are confined in the external reservoirs to boost energy density (Fig. 6b). In this case, the question is how to store charges in a solid material which is centimeters or even meters away from the electrode. The answer is to use the dissolved redox species as charge carriers (redox mediator) between electrochemical reactor and external reservoir. Thus, dissolved species do not act as energy-storing materials but as molecular wiring, which allows for a drastic reduction in their concentrations. This strategy has been successfully demonstrated for several battery chemistries using a conventional RFB architecture, in which solid active materials were simply added and confined in the external reservoir, e.g. non-aqueous [173][174][175], aqueous acid [176], aqueous neutral [177][178][179] and aqueous alkaline [161] electrolytes.The use of a conventional RFB architecture is only possible when the solid active materials are confined in the external reservoirs to boost energy density (Fig. 6b).

        <p>The key process of this approach is the reversible and spontaneous charge transfer reaction between redox electrolyte and solid active material confined in the reservoir. When two dissolved redox species A and B with redox potentials above and below the redox potential of a solid material are used in one reservoir, species A would act as redox mediator during the charging process while species B would mediate during discharging. The main downside of using two redox mediators for each reservoir is the penalty in voltage efficiency [173]. Instead, one single redox mediator (e.g. potassium ferrocyanide) for each reservoir may be used taking advantage of the changes in redox potential of the electrolyte with the state of charge according to Nernst equation [161,179,180], solving the issue of the voltage efficiency. Perfect matching of redox potentials of redox mediator and solid active material is of critical importance for using single redox mediator. Once achieved, the solid active material becomes the main contributor in terms of energy density and energy cost.The key process of this approach is the reversible and spontaneous charge transfer reaction between redox electrolyte and solid active material confined in the reservoir.

For SSFB, important aspects such as shunt currents, pumping consumptions, maximum current densities (solid particles block current lines and increase ionic resistance) still require further study. Although it is certainly early to make a final assessment, energy efficiency is not expected to exceed the state-of-the-art values for RFBs.

        <p>In SSFBs, power cost can be potentially reduced since expensive ionselective membrane are not needed.

        <p>All-copper-hybrid redox flow battery technology could be a competitive energy storage device, providing a low cost, easily scale up, efficient and safe system for the future energy markets. Additionally, copper is an abundant material (produced in around 20 million tonnes/ year), with easily recycle process and extremely lower cost (6.5 € kg -1 , 53 € kW -1 h -1 electrolyte cost [214]) in comparison with vanadium technology (20 € kg -1 ). All-copper RFB exploits the three redox states of copper, following equation (14), where the Cu + and Cu 2+ are species in solution and Cu 0 is platted/stripped in the electrode. The main drawback of the system is the relatively low cell voltage (~0.6 V) at fully charged state, significantly lower than other systems (&gt;1.2 V). The proof of concept was demonstrated by Lloyd and Sanz et al.

The preliminary results were quite promising, allowing excellent energy density value (ca. 20 Wh L -1 ) which is comparable with vanadium technology. However, the operational current intensity was relatively low (20 mA cm -2 ) as well as the energy and voltage efficiencies around 50% and 60%, respectively, operating at 40 • C. After that, several efforts have been made in order to increase this attractive technology [215]. For instance, Lloyd et al.

Moreover, Leung et al. (2016) studied the effect of substituting planar metal foils by porous electrodes for the electrodeposition of copper. Promising life span (ca. 35 cycles) with high coulombic and voltage efficiencies ca.99 and 72%, respectively, at 50 mA cm -2 and 50 • C could be achieved.

The cells with this configuration can be recharged mechanically, i.e. "refilled" by replacing the aged anolyte with a fresh slurry. The aged anolyte is then recovered by zinc reduction outside the cell, in a separate environment. High power densities are generally obtained with this configuration, whilst critical issues are the clog problems and finding a way to fully utilize metal particles in the slurry. Aqueous Zn-MAFB cells, with an anode composed of zinc pellet beds intercepting the KOH electrolyte flow and with an MnO 2 cathode catalyst, were capable to deliver peak power densities of 435 mW cm -2 . This Zn -MABF concept was also successfully upscaled at stack level. A stack of 5 cells, delivered a peak power of 138 W [227]. While cell refueling is an option, it requires that the Zn-anolyte is regenerated ex-situ, even by chemical processes.

The semiconductor-liquid junction cell is performed matching the energy-level of the semiconductor and redox couple, defining the photovoltage of the cell. (2) Direct integration of the photovoltaic (PV) module, which is stacked together with the electrochemical module of RFB, operating autonomously. The photovoltage is generated by PV module, independently of energy levels of the redox couple and semiconductor.The system has been engineered in two architectures, enabling several photocharging mechanism (Fig. 8b): (1) Photo-assisted electrode: i) Photo-electrochemical (PEC), and ii) Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC).

        <p>Despite of the state-of-the-art progress, the SRFB technology is in an infancy R&amp;D stage, trying to overcome several drawbacks related with the low-capacity, insufficient photovoltage, efficient, and stable materials. To date, all SRFB prototypes have been demonstrated with metal (i.e. all Vanadium) or organic molecules as well as combination of both (i.e. metal-organic molecules) as electroactive species in aqueous electrolyte. The record-breaking conversion solar-to-output electricity efficiency (SOEE) of 14.1% was achieved by Li.et al. (2018). They demonstrated the feasibility of achieving excellent photopotential (i.e. 2.4 V), using the monolithic (TiO 2 /Ge/GaAs/InGaP) PV modules integrated into RFB. This RFB system operates with (0.1 M) 4-OH-TEMPO and (0.1 M) methyl viologen as the catholyte and the anolyte respectively. Under 1-sun illumination (100 mW cm -2 ), a 14 mA cm -2 of photocurrent value was obtained, keeping stable over 10 cycles [250]. Motivated by these findings, Urbain et al. (2019) demonstrated, for the first time, a bias free SVRFB operating in real concentration of vanadium electrolytes (1.6 M), using triple junction TF silicon solar cell under illumination (300 mW cm -2 ). The authors achieved 25 mA cm -2 as bias free-photocurrent, enabling 54 Wh L -1 as energy density values, while the SOEE was roughly 10% [251].Despite of the state-of-the-art progress, the SRFB technology is in an infancy R&amp;D stage, trying to overcome several drawbacks related with the low-capacity, insufficient photovoltage, efficient, and stable materials.

        <p>The emerging "Air-Breathing aqueous sulfur flow battery" (Li 2 Sx/air or Na 2 Sx/air) [253] takes advantage of using inexpensive chemicals, achieving competitive prices (being limited by precious metals used by cathode electrodes); less than 1 € kW -1 h -1 using Na 2 S chemicals. The battery could work in both electrolytes; acid or alkaline, giving a E 0 roughly 1.26 V at neutral pH (equations ( 17) and ( 18)).The emerging "Air-Breathing aqueous sulfur flow battery" (Li 2 Sx/air or Na 2 Sx/air) [253] takes advantage of using inexpensive chemicals, achieving competitive prices (being limited by precious metals used by cathode electrodes); less than 1 € kW -1 h -1 using Na 2 S chemicals.

        <p>The proof of the concept has been demonstrated in flow mode (10 mL min -1 ) using dual cathode configuration based on IrO 2 (for OER) in combination with gas diffusion layer with Pt/C (for ORR) and Sulfided Ni Mesh as anode. Both compartments were separated by LISICON membrane. 1 M Li 2 S 4 in 1 M LiOH serves as anolyte, while 0.5 M Li 2 SO + 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 serves as catholyte. Cyclability studies demonstrated promising lifespan for the Li 2 Sx/air RFB, achieving 49 cycles (960 h) at 0.325 mA cm -2 with a 55% of round-trip voltage efficiency at 55 • C. On discharge, the RFB can deliver a 3.2 mW cm -2 at 6.0 mA cm -2 . The authors state that the system is limited by the membrane resistance.The proof of the concept has been demonstrated in flow mode (10 mL min -1 ) using dual cathode configuration based on IrO 2 (for OER) in combination with gas diffusion layer with Pt/C (for ORR) and Sulfided Ni Mesh as anode.

        <p>It is well-known that CO 2 emissions is one of the world's most pressing challenges against climate change. Nowadays, the recycling of CO 2 and its conversion to value-added chemicals is a sustainable and reliable route to solve the future social problem. In this framework, CO reduction coupled with the generation of electricity could represent an eco-friendly and economical solution. This idea was exploited by Wang et al. (2020), demonstrating the Zn-CO 2 flow battery concept [254]. Here, a one-compartment cell is used with a nanofiber as cathode, which is fed with CO 2 in a flow mode; and Zn wire as anode, working in a static mode. [EMIM][BF 4 ] ionic liquid was used as electrolyte. The working principle is the oxidation of zinc to Zn (OH) 2 in the anode, which provide e -/H + to cathode for the CO 2 -to-CH 4 conversion (Faradaic efficiency (FE) = 94%) (equation ( 19)). This new strategy could replace the traditional CO 2 electrolysers, that involve oxygen evolution reaction, that implies a large overpotential and high cell voltage (i.e. roughly 1.5 V to produce CO). Furthermore, the authors claim that the battery generates an energy density of 288.3 Wh kg -1 (based on the zinc mass), as well as the feasibility to regenerate Zn metal anode in situ by supplying energy, which can be replaced in the future applications by renewable energy.It is well-known that CO 2 emissions is one of the world's most pressing challenges against climate change.

        <p>Several technologies are being commercialized, VRFB, ZBFB, IRFB, HBFB, AORFB among others, where VRFB is the technology more diffused and successful. Availability and cost of vanadium to face great energy storage demand is the main limitation for VRFB. Efforts continue to improve components (i.e. electrolyte composition, membrane and electrode), performance (efficiency and power and current densities) and business approach to bridge the gap with defined targets. Substituting the problematic catholyte material as proposed in VOFB and VBFB implies a high uncertainty level for technologies still far from maturity and with identified issues as handling of toxic bromine, common to ZBFBs and HBFBs, or need for a catalyst to use of air/oxygen reactants.Several technologies are being commercialized, VRFB, ZBFB, IRFB, HBFB, AORFB among others, where VRFB is the technology more diffused and successful.

        <p>A general strategy to decrease cost looks at alternative chemistries. POMs and AORFB propose highly tuneable and potentially highperforming materials although the former is at an infancy stage. The use of organics is foreseen as an option to assess the high demand for energy storage based on the availability of materials and the reduced cost deriving from large scale production. Current research efforts aim to reduce degradation rate, identified as the main shortcoming, and improve performance. Electrolytes less aggressive and/or able of limited crossover across the separator may enable a reduction of the power module cost thanks to cheaper separators. The wide range of materials available for AORFB, complemented by high-throughput screening and computational investigations, could result in the irruption of new chemistries for RFBs.A general strategy to decrease cost looks at alternative chemistries.

        <p>Among different approaches to hybrid RFBs, despite the early success of ZBFBs, there is a trend towards low-cost safe materials, such as Zn-Fe flow batteries that are already commercially available. Risks inherent to metal plating, e.g. dendrite formation, have hindered larger deployment. Efforts focus on increasing current density and efficiency particularly problematic for MAFBs with more complex redox processes and different phases involved. Despite operational limitations, these technologies are likely to meet cost targets as of low-cost employed materials and innovative low-cost All-iron, All-copper and zinc air batteries could hit particularly low LCOS values. More real environment demonstration results should be pursued to achieve the social acceptance. Li-MAFBs hold great promise in terms of energy density but its applicability to stationary storage in terms of safety, cost and lifespan is uncertain.Among different approaches to hybrid RFBs, despite the early success of ZBFBs, there is a trend towards low-cost safe materials, such as Zn-Fe flow batteries that are already commercially available.

        <p>Complete removal of the physical barrier between electrolytes will imply a significant decrease in the battery cost. Microfluidic batteries rely on hydrodynamic engineering to exploit the laminar flow of electrolytes and further developments on battery architecture are needed to enable recharging. According to their microfluidic design, application of these batteries is limited to a series of commodities and small power utilities. Biphasic batteries using immiscible redox electrolytes that are separated by thermodynamic principles are a better option to be scaledup, although still at low maturity level. Alternative reactor designs are required to consolidate the membrane-free approach. Self-discharge has been identified as the most important challenge.Complete removal of the physical barrier between electrolytes will imply a significant decrease in the battery cost.

        <p>The use of insoluble solid electroactive materials in redox flow batteries allows the increase of energy density. In the semi-solid flow battery (SSFB), solid materials are pumping as flowable slurries through entire systems, eliminating the need for expensive ion-selective membranes in the power conversion reactor. In the solid mediated flow battery (SMFB), solid materials are confined in the external reservoirs so that dense and viscous slurries do not need to be continuously pumped. In both cases, energy cost will be dependent on the energy cost of the solid materials. Still, much efforts need to be devoted to these immature two battery technologies to be able to foreseen their full potential.The use of insoluble solid electroactive materials in redox flow batteries allows the increase of energy density.
