        <p>Digital Twin was conceived in [6] as a method to predict the structural behavior of an aircraft by analyzing and simulating the aircraft's behavior on its digital model in 2011. A year later, NASA defined Digital Twin as "an integrated multi-physics, multi-scale, probabilistic simulation of a vehicle or system that uses the best available physical models, sensor updates, fleet history, and so forth, to mirror the life of its flying twin [2]." There was limited exploration since then, until 2015, the explosion of machine learning, wireless communication and cloud computing boosted the research activities on Digital Twin. Several definitions of Digital Twin came out afterwards. For instance, Digital Twin was seen as the next generation of simulation [7]. Tao and Zhang believed that Digital Twin is a method of achieving the convergence between physical and virtual spaces [8]. Now, Digital Twin has evolved into a broader concept that refers to a virtual representation of manufacturing elements such as personnel, products, assets and process definitions, a living model that continuously updates and changes as the physical counterpart changes to represent status, working conditions, product geometries and resource states in a synchronous manner [9]. The digital representation provides both the elements and the dynamics of how a physical 'thing' operates and lives throughout its life cycle.Digital Twin was conceived in [6] as a method to predict the structural behavior of an aircraft by analyzing and simulating the aircraft's behavior on its digital model in 2011.

        <p>There exist diverse viewpoints on the relationships between Digital Twin and other concepts, such as simulation, Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) and Internet of Things (IoT). Though these concepts are closely related, they, by their nature, are different on the concept, core elements, and application.There exist diverse viewpoints on the relationships between Digital Twin and other concepts, such as simulation, Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) and Internet of Things (IoT).

        <p>A Digital Twin is a digital replica of a real-world 'thing.' While this looks close to simulation, Digital Twin is much more. A Digital Twin is a high-fidelity representation of the operational dynamics of its physical counterpart, enabled by near real-time synchronization between the cyberspace and physical space [10]. The operational dynamics are critical elements of a Digital Twin because a twin's behavior is based on near real-time data coming from the actual physical counterpart. Simulation focuses on what could happen in the real world (what-if scenario), but not what is currently happening. In the manufacturing context, a Digital Twin can be used for monitoring, control, diagnostics, and prediction, other than just simulation [10].A Digital Twin is a digital replica of a real-world 'thing.'

        <p>Though Digital Twin, CPS, and IoT all use networking and sensors, Digital Twin is a different but interrelated concept with CPS or IoT, as shown in Fig. 1.Though Digital Twin, CPS, and IoT all use networking and sensors, Digital Twin is a different but interrelated concept with CPS or IoT, as shown in Fig. 1.</p>
        <p>A CPS is characterized by a physical asset and its Digital Twin. In contrast, a Digital Twin is limited to the digital model, not the twinning physical asset, though a Digital Twin cannot live without its twining asset in the physical space. In other words, Digital Twin represents the prerequisite for the development of a CPS [12].A CPS is characterized by a physical asset and its Digital Twin.

        <p>Digital Twin has attracted strong interests from industry practitioners too. The Digital Twin market is forecasted to reach $15.66 billion by 2023 at an annual growth rate of 37.87% according to a market research in 2017 [13]. GE developed a Digital Twin platform -PREDIX that can better understand and predict asset performance [14]. SIEMENS's focus covers smart operations during the complete process of product design, production and operation [15]. ABB emphasizes on enabling data-driven decision makings [16]. Microsoft also geared up its Digital Twin product portfolio, providing a ubiquitous IoT platform for modeling and analyzing the interactions between people, spaces, and devices [17]. Initiatives from these tech leaders have significantly pushed the boundary of Digital Twin for engineering applications.Digital Twin has attracted strong interests from industry practitioners too.

        <p>Though some early adopters have demonstrated some applications of Digital Twin for manufacturing, current implementation limitations are (1) inadequate understanding of the connotation of Digital Twin-driven smart manufacturing, with the current focus mostly on product operation and maintenance, (2) the lack of reference models for Digital Twin, and (3) superficial knowledge of the research questions and challenges of Digital Twin, with current research outcomes mostly showing preliminary application examples.Though some early adopters have demonstrated some applications of Digital Twin for manufacturing, current implementation limitations are (1) inadequate understanding of the connotation of Digital Twin-driven smart manufacturing, with the current focus mostly on product operation and maintenance, (2) the lack of reference models for Digital Twin, and (3) superficial knowledge of the research questions and challenges of Digital Twin, with current research outcomes mostly showing preliminary application examples.</p>

        <p>Smart manufacturing is coined by several agencies, such as the Department of Energy (DoE) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States. According to Davis et al., smart manufacturing is the dramatically intensified application of 'manufacturing intelligence' throughout the manufacturing and supply chain enterprise [18]. It comprises the real-time understanding, reasoning, planning and management of all aspects of manufacturing processes, facilitated by the pervasive use of advanced sensor-based data analytics, modeling, and simulation. NIST defines smart manufacturing systems as "fullyintegrated, collaborative manufacturing systems that respond in real time to meet changing demands and conditions in the factory, in the supply network, and customer needs.

        <p>In smart manufacturing, a physical 'thing' in a factory is connected to the Industrial Internet via standard cyber gateways and abstracted as a Digital Twin in the cyberspace. Each Digital Twin in the cyberspace is an abstraction of its counterpart in the physical world by reflecting its physical status. The cyberspace stores and processes the streamed data from connected physical objects. These data are used to model, simulate and predict the status of each physical thing under dynamic working conditions. The pervasive use of smart technologies, such as Big Data Processing and Artificial Intelligence enables the extraction of manufacturing intelligence at every single moment of manufacturing activities. The collective intelligence in locally connected factories and the cyberspace paves the way for some dramatic changes from the aspects of intra-business operation, inter-business collaboration and production model, as shown in Fig. 3.In smart manufacturing, a physical 'thing' in a factory is connected to the Industrial Internet via standard cyber gateways and abstracted as a Digital Twin in the cyberspace.

        <p>• Digital Twin for manufacturing assets: A manufacturing asset can be connected and abstracted to the cyberspace via its Digital Twin. Manufacturers can gain a clearer picture of real-world performance and operating conditions of a manufacturing asset via near realtime data captured from the asset and make proactive optimal operation decisions. With truthful information flowing from a manufacturing asset, manufacturers can improve their situational awareness and enhance operation resilience and flexibility, especially in the context of mass personalization. • Digital Twin for people: Digital Twins can also connect workers at the shop floor. The representation of a person, including personal data like weight, health data, activity data, and emotional status can help to establish models to understand personal wellbeing and working conditions of humans in a factory. The understanding of human state at workforce can help design human-centered human-machine collaboration strategies to increase the physical and psychological health of workers, as well as achieving best production performance. Workers can also upskill themselves via ultra-realistic training programs which blend physical factory setups with virtual what-if scenarios. The ability to set up personalized virtual training programs based on Digital Twins of workers and factories can lead to tremendous resource optimization and operational efficiency. • Digital Twin for factories: Digital Twins can also work for factories, making a replica of a live factory environment. Digital Twin and data-driven production operations can allow the establishment of a self-organizing factory environment with complete operational visibility and flexibility. Connectivity and data tracking throughout the complete manufacturing process enable factory operations to be transformed into data-driven evidence-based practices, offering the capabilities of tracing product fault sources, analyzing production efficient bottlenecks and predicting future resource requirements. • Digital Twin for production networks: By connecting manufacturing assets, people and service via Digital Twin, every aspect of business can be virtually represented. Connecting distributed Digital Twins between companies will allow companies to build virtually connected production networks. Leveraging Big Data capabilities, this strategy provides unprecedented visibility into operation performance and creates the possibility of predicting future needs in a network of Digital Twins.• Digital Twin for manufacturing assets: A manufacturing asset can be connected and abstracted to the cyberspace via its Digital Twin.

        <p>Digital Twin reflects the two-way dynamic mapping between a physical object and its virtual model in the cyberspace [24]. A Digital Twin presents a middleware architecture that abstracts its physical counterpart for high-level engineering management systems to make near real-time decisions [25]. Fig. 4 shows a Digital Twin reference model. At the technical core, the development of Digital Twin needs three components: (1) an information model that abstracts the specifications of a physical object, (2) a communication mechanism that transfers bidirectional data between a Digital Twin and its physical counterpart, and (3) a data processing module that can extract information from heterogeneous multi-source data to construct the live representation of a physical object. These three components must work together for constructing a Digital Twin. Without an information model to abstract the features of a physical entity, data transmitted to the cyberspace will lose its meaning and context. Without a data synchronization mechanism between a physical model and its information model, the connection and reflection between these two ends will disconnect, and the information model becomes a one-off snapshot of its physical counterpart. High-performance data processing is the key to bridge the gap between the heterogeneous data stream and the Digital Twin information model.Digital Twin reflects the two-way dynamic mapping between a physical object and its virtual model in the cyberspace [24].

        <p>The most predominant standards for developing product Digital Twin are ISO 10303 [27] and ISO 14649 [28] standards. ISO 10303 [27], known as STEP, provides a neutral data structure for exchanging product data between CAD systems. Its latest development of AP242 [29] for 'Managed Model Based 3D Engineering' by merging AP203 and AP204, with a focus on the representation of 3D model data, geometric tolerance and PMI (Product Manufacturing Information), provides a sound technological base for global design and manufacturing collaboration. Geometric tolerance and PMI information can now be read by machines directly from product design files in STEP AP242 model without the need of interpreting 3D drawings. This change closes the communication gaps between various stages of the product lifecycle, resulting in autonomous process planning, manufacturing, inspection, and so forth.The most predominant standards for developing product Digital Twin are ISO 10303 [27] and ISO 14649 [28] standards.

        <p>ISO 14649 [28] and ISO 10303-238 [30] (also known as STEP-NC) are proposed to replace the RS274D (ISO 6983) M and G code via a modern associative language that directly connects the CAD design data used to determine the machining requirements for operation with the downstream fabrication processes. STEP-NC allows manufacturing organizations to share machining information between machines seamlessly via the exchange of semantic-enriched 'what-to-do' information. It relies on intelligent machine tools to interpret 'how-to-do' instructions adaptive to the local machining conditions. The shift of interpreting local machining instructions into the machine controller level maximizes the interoperability between distributed machine tools.ISO 14649 [28] and ISO 10303-238 [30] (also known as STEP-NC) are proposed to replace the RS274D (ISO 6983) M and G code via a modern associative language that directly connects the CAD design data used to determine the machining requirements for operation with the downstream fabrication processes.

        <p>It is common that the information model from a single standard cannot meet the application requirements because of the breadth of the potential application of Digital Twin. Past studies suggest a systematic information model development process to ensure maximum standard conformance and usability [35]. MTConnect and OPC-UA community also recommend a bottomup approach to expanding existing information models to suit new application needs, especially when now IT disruptions outpace the manufacturing standard development.It is common that the information model from a single standard cannot meet the application requirements because of the breadth of the potential application of Digital Twin.

        <p>A communication network is another critical factor for enabling the establishment of Digital Twins. State synchronization between a Digital Twin and its counterpart in the physical space relies on bi-directional and real-time data communication. State changes to a physical object are detected by sensors and transmitted to its Digital Twin in the cyberspace. In this regard, industrial communication protocols can help collect data from physical devices.A communication network is another critical factor for enabling the establishment of Digital Twins.

        <p>In the late 1970s to late 1980s, several dedicated industrial networks (or Fieldbus), such as PROFIBUS [39] and Modbus [38], were developed to support the machine to machine communications and the remote terminal control of programmable logic controllers, for process and peripheral control/automation. As shown in Table 1, many Fieldbus protocols were designed to operate on different physical media and have widely incompatible communication stacks across different layers of the OSI model. This has thus lead to closed-loop silos which prevents data exchange and communication between standards. The current trend is moving towards adopting Ethernet-based standard, such as Modbus/TCP [41], in order to facilitate inter-communication at a higher level (e.g., the Internet or the enterprise control system).In the late 1970s to late 1980s, several dedicated industrial networks (or Fieldbus), such as PROFIBUS [39] and Modbus [38], were developed to support the machine to machine communications and the remote terminal control of programmable logic controllers, for process and peripheral control/automation.

        <p>Table 1 also provides a high-level comparison between different types of industrial networks in terms of their communication data rate and the number of supported devices on a single network. While the performance varies significantly among the three categories, it should be noted that the data rate and the number of supported devices in a specific network are heavily influenced by the selected physical medium, operation mode (and hence communication overhead), network topology, and the length of the physical medium (e.g., cable length). While Fieldbus networks seem to offer a slower data rate and fewer devices, their key advantage is usually the deterministic communication time for safety-critical operations.Table 1 also provides a high-level comparison between different types of industrial networks in terms of their communication data rate and the number of supported devices on a single network.

        <p>An increasing number of manufacturers are using Industrial Ethernet-based solutions to connect systems. This is driven by the need of high-performance integration between factory installations and the Industrial Internet of Things [45]. The advantages of Industrial Ethernet over traditional Fieldbus systems are its homogenous network infrastructure, ease of integration with the Internet, greater bandwidth to transmit safety-critical data, and the ability to communicate over longer distances. Even with the adoption of a common Ethernet standard, devices that support different Industrial Ethernet standards are not compatible or interoperable with each other because of the unique protocol stacks in different Industrial Ethernet standards. The future Ethernet IEEE 802.1 TSN (Time Sensitive Networks) standard could eventually make time-critical and deterministic network communication via standard Ethernet components possible, thus facilitating wider adoption and better interoperability.An increasing number of manufacturers are using Industrial Ethernet-based solutions to connect systems.

        <p>One of the key driving features in Digital Twin and throughout the automation and manufacturing industries is the need for data/information exchange. This is evident from the early development of the Fieldbus systems. Since 2000, the concept of IoT and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are also impacting the industrial network field. Most of modern approaches are adopting existing standards such as IEEE 802.11 [46] (e.g., WiFi-based), IEEE802.15.1 (e.g., Bluetooth-based), and IEEE 802.15.4 [47] (e.g., Zigbee-based). While wireless networks have the intrinsic benefit of ease of installation due to no wiring and low cost, existing approaches are still limited due to the lack of reliability and potentially long latency for safety-critical and real-time data.One of the key driving features in Digital Twin and throughout the automation and manufacturing industries is the need for data/information exchange.

        <p>A missing value is a datum that has not been stored or gathered due to a faulty sampling process, cost restrictions or limitations in the acquisition process. Inappropriate handling of the missing values will easily lead to poor knowledge extraction and wrong conclusions [19]. One option is to discard the instances that may contain a missing value. However, this approach is rarely beneficial, as eliminating instances may produce a bias in the data processing process, and a Digital Twin can miss some critical snapshots. Another method is to use a statistical method to 'guess' an approximate value to fill the missing values. This method can be a good choice if integrated with domain knowledge reasoning. There are physical models behind activities occurring in the manufacturing environment. The domain knowledge can be used as the base rules for making a reasonable prediction of the missing value.A missing value is a datum that has not been stored or gathered due to a faulty sampling process, cost restrictions or limitations in the acquisition process.

        <p>Conflicting or redundant data records can introduce bias in the data analysis results. Two main approaches can be used to solve the problem. The first one is to correct the noise by using data polishing [50], primarily when the data affects the annotation of a physical-related status. The second method is to use noise filters [51], which identifies and removes the noisy instances in the data while maintaining the representation of the physical state of the object to be modeled. Both methods require extensive use of domain knowledge to drive the polishing and filtering decisions to ensure corrective actions can be taken so that the nature of the data set is not changed.Conflicting or redundant data records can introduce bias in the data analysis results.

        <p>There is a multitude amount of data storage options tailored to different kinds of data formats and application requirements, which are classified as relational databases and non-relational databases (as shown in Table 2). Relational databases are good choices for applications that involve the management of complex database transactions and heavy data analysis, because of referential integrity. Non-relational databases are geared towards managing large sets of varied and frequently updated data, often in distributed systems. They avoid the rigid schemas associated with relational databases. The architectures vary and are separated into four primary classifications, each of which is suitable for different application scenarios as listed in Table 2.There is a multitude amount of data storage options tailored to different kinds of data formats and application requirements, which are classified as relational databases and non-relational databases (as shown in Table 2).

        <p>Though the above technologies provide the foundation for Big Data processing, highperformance processing of time-series data is the key to the successful implementation of a Digital Twin. This is due to two reasons: (1) data gathered from the physical world are mostly discrete time data, and (2) there is timeliness requirement for a Digital Twin, regardless of the latency requirement between a Digital Twin and its physical counterpart. The effective handling of time-series data to construct a Digital Twin can ensure a required latency between a Digital Twin and its physical counterpart.Though the above technologies provide the foundation for Big Data processing, highperformance processing of time-series data is the key to the successful implementation of a Digital Twin.

        <p>Research Issue 1: Architecture pattern for a Digital Twin There exist two system architecture patterns, namely server-based and edge-based. In serverbased architecture, the data acquired from a physical device is routed back to a centralized server that performs the data analysis and Digital Twin construction. This pattern provides economies of scale and facilitates easy maintenance. In edge-based architecture, some data analysis is applied at the 'edge' of the system. That is, data pre-processing is performed locally and on the raw data captured from a physical device. As a result, edge-based architecture should be more effective on low-latency data processing if designed well. However, this pattern is more complicated to maintain.Research Issue 1: Architecture pattern for a Digital Twin There exist two system architecture patterns, namely server-based and edge-based.

        <p>Research Issue 2: Communication latency requirement for a Digital Twin Latency requirement is application-driven. The application scenario determines the required communication latency between a physical device and its Digital Twin. This is because the system development costs and difficulties increase significantly as the communication latency requirement becomes stringent. In practice, Digital Twin-based shop floor monitoring can accept higher latency than cloud-based industrial control. BMWi, Germany [85] specifies the nominal communication latency for various manufacturing applications, which can be used as a guideline for designing the system architecture of a Digital Twin application.Research Issue 2: Communication latency requirement for a Digital Twin Latency requirement is application-driven.

        <p>Though anyone can develop a Digital Twin solution using common technologies, standards will facilitate the longevity of a Digital Twin solution. Standard-compatible Digital Twin solutions can inherit the flexibility, interoperability and scalability of existing and new standards for information model and communication protocols. This is especially important when a Digital Twin will be deployed in an open network of Digital Twins. Recognizing the need for standardization, ISO is actively developing a dedicated standard for Digital Twin manufacturing [9].Though anyone can develop a Digital Twin solution using common technologies, standards will facilitate the longevity of a Digital Twin solution.

This is especially important when a Digital Twin will be deployed in an open network of Digital Twins. Recognizing the need for standardization, ISO is actively developing a dedicated standard for Digital Twin manufacturing [9].</p>
        <p>Research Issue 5: Functionalities of a Digital Twin Existing Digital Twin applications are mainly developed for monitoring and prediction purposes and used as decision-making support applications for humans. Though human involvement in the smart manufacturing environment is essential, direct/autonomous feedback control from the Digital Twin to the physical world should be developed. Hence, the Digital Twin application can endow the physical objects with a certain degree of autonomy.Research Issue 5: Functionalities of a Digital Twin Existing Digital Twin applications are mainly developed for monitoring and prediction purposes and used as decision-making support applications for humans.

        <p>A Digital Twin model can evolve over time as a result of engineering changes to its physical counterpart, changes to the modelling interests throughout the lifecycle of the physical counterpart, or other cases. In these cases, the different versions of a Digital Twin models over time should be captured, stored and integrated. Snapshot-based and change-based version management principles can be applied for the effective management different versions of a Digital Twin model.A Digital Twin model can evolve over time as a result of engineering changes to its physical counterpart, changes to the modelling interests throughout the lifecycle of the physical counterpart, or other cases.

        <p>Humans play an important role in the Digital Twin-driven smart manufacturing environment. While some low-level operations can be autonomously achieved without human intervention, many decision-making activities have to be performed by humans. Though some new interaction technologies such as AR have been studied and implemented in a manufacturing environment to improve human-machine interactions, humans are still not considered as an integral part of the smart manufacturing system. Significant research effort needs to be made on the topic of Digital Twin for people in the smart manufacturing environment in the future.Humans play an important role in the Digital Twin-driven smart manufacturing environment.
