        <p>In the high-speed railway industry, the pantograph-catenary system is responsible to provide continuous electric energy for the high-speed train. The pantographcatenary system suffers multiple impacts from the complex work environment. The vehicle-track excitation is one of the normal disturbances to the pantographcatenary interaction. Previous studies only consider the vertical effect of the vehicle-track vibration on the pantograph-catenary interaction. To address this deficiency, both of the pantograph-catenary and vehicle-track models are constructed in this paper. The validations of both models are verified by the experimental test and the world benchmark, respectively. The pantograph base follows the translations and rotations of the car-body caused by random rail irregularities. In combination with a spatial contact model between the contact wire and the pantograph strip, the spatial vibration of the carbody can be fully considered in the pantograph-catenary interaction. The statistical analysis, stochastic analysis and frequency analysis are performed to make sense of the effect of the random track irregularities on the pantograph-catenary interaction.In the high-speed railway industry, the pantograph-catenary system is responsible to provide continuous electric energy for the high-speed train.

        <p>In recent years, the impressive expansion of the high-speed network mileage around the world is the significant reflection of the global tendency towards the incremental demand of high-speed railway from all the aspects of economy and society [1]. The fundamental research on the dynamics of coupled systems in high-speed railway attracts everincreasing attention from the industrial and the academic communities, as they are main factors to keep the safe and reliable operation of high-speed railway, as well as determine the maximum speed of high-speed train [2]. Due to the complexity of the high-speed railway system, many independent relationships exist among the train [3], the electrical equipment [4], the infrastructure [5] and the environment [6], which interact, depend upon and restrict each other. The most significant examples are the vehicle-track interaction [7], the pantograph-catenary interaction [8], the fluid-solid interaction [9] and the electromechanical coupling [10]. Among them, the pantograph-catenary system is the only source of power for electric trains. As shown in Figure 1, the catenary constructed along the railroad is responsible for transmitting the electric energy to the locomotive through the sliding contact with the pantograph installed on the locomotive. Due to its complex work environment [11], the pantograph-catenary system suffers multiple excitations from the vehicle-track vibration [12], the component defects [13,14], the contact wire irregularities [15] and the wind load [16], which make the pantographcatenary to be the most venerable part in the traction power system. According to the previous studies, the wind load primarily affects the pantograph-catenary interaction only in extreme conditions [17]. The component defect of the catenary occurs intermittently [18]. Only the vehicle-track vibration has a continuous effect on the pantograph-catenary interaction. Generally, the quality of current collection for a high-speed train is directly represented by the contact force between the strip of the pantograph and the contact wire of the catenary [19]. An excessive contact force is able to aggravate the wear and fatigue of the contact wire and the strip [20], while an inadequate contact force may increase the possibility of the contact loss between the pantograph and the catenary. Once the contact loss occurs, the arcing and sparking between the contact wire and the strip cause the sudden increase of the temperature, which may result in the erosion and liquation of the contact surface [21]. Sometimes, the contact loss may even cause the interruption of the electrical transmission to the train. In order to ensure stable contact between the pantograph and the catenary, various pantograph-catenary models are proposed to make sense of the complex coupling dynamics of the pantograph-catenary system [22]. The catenary modelling methodology has experienced a long-term evolvement from the simple lumped-parameter model [23] to the increasingly complicated distributedparameter model [24]. The pantograph is normally modelled by three or two masses connected by equivalent springs and dampers, as it is an efficient representation for the physical characteristics. Some researchers attempt to develop advanced multi-body models for pantographs [25][26][27], which have better capabilities to describe the realistic behaviours. Employing advanced numerical methods, the efficiencies of simulation models are considerably improved [28][29][30]. The accuracies of the proposed models are verified by comparisons with experimental data from laboratory [31][32][33] and field tests [34][35][36]. Based on the simulation results, some effective strategies are proposed to improve the quality of current collection, such as tuning the contact wire tension [37],In recent years, the impressive expansion of the high-speed network mileage around the world is the significant reflection of the global tendency towards the incremental demand of high-speed railway from all the aspects of economy and society [1].

        <p>As the ever-increasing understanding of the pantograph-catenary dynamics, more attentions are paid to optimise the wave propagation behaviour [45] and the elasticity distribution [46] along the contact wire. Considering the realistic work condition, the dynamic interaction between the pantograph and the catenary is always affected by complex external perturbations. In [47,48], the wind field along the catenary is established to analyse its effect on the contact force. The aerodynamics on the pantograph is quantified through the computational fluid dynamics [49], the wind tunnel experiment [50] and the field test [51]. As for the effect of vehicle-track excitation, it is worthwhile to mention the works of Zhai et al [52] and Carnicero et al [53]. In Zhai's work, a multibody pantograph model is established. The carbody acceleration is exerted on the bottom of the pantograph to simulate the vertical effect of the vehicle-track vibration on the pantograph-catenary interaction. The results show that the large-amplitude rail irregularities have a non-negligible effect on the contact force of pantograph-catenary.As the ever-increasing understanding of the pantograph-catenary dynamics, more attentions are paid to optimise the wave propagation behaviour [45] and the elasticity distribution [46] along the contact wire.

        <p>However, in these two works, only the vertical effect of the vehicle-track excitation on the pantograph-catenary interaction is considered. In reality, the rail irregularities, cross-wind [54] and flexibility [55] cause the motion of the car-body with six degrees of freedom (DOFs). Except for the vertical translation, the pitch and roll of the car-body definitely cause the vertical movement of the pantograph bottom [56], which thus brings more disturbance to the contact force of the pantograph-catenary.However, in these two works, only the vertical effect of the vehicle-track excitation on the pantograph-catenary interaction is considered.

        <p>Furthermore, the lateral translation, yaw and roll of the car-body may cause the variance of the contact point position on the pantograph strip, which deserves further analysis to avoid the pantograph de-wiring from the contact wire. In this paper, the shortfalls in previous studies are addressed. A spatial model to couple the pantograph-catenary and the vehicle-track is proposed. As the mass and stiffness of the pantograph are some orders of magnitude smaller than the car-body and the suspensions in the vehicle, the effect of the pantograph-catenary on the vehicle dynamics is totally negligible. Based on this assumption, a methodology is proposed to make the pantograph base follow the movement of the carbody. In combination with a spatial contact model between the contact wire and the pantograph strip, the spatial vibration of the vehicle can be fully considered in the pantograph-catenary interaction.

        <p>As is well known, the track irregularity is the main source of vehicle vibration. In this section, the dynamic performance of pantograph-catenary is evaluated with different levels of rail qualities. Without loss of generality, the reference model of pantographcatenary in the benchmark is adopted in the following analyses. A 20-span of catenary is established, and the central 10 spans are selected as an analysis object. The train speed is defined as 320 km/h according to the benchmark [22]. As for the vehicle-track, a typical EMU model present in [65] is adopted. It should be noted that normally the high-speed train is not allowed to operate with awful track condition to ensure the comfort, stability and safety of the operation. However, the purpose of this section is not to reproduce the realistic phenomenon, but to make sense of the interaction performance of pantographcatenary with different levels of track quality.As is well known, the track irregularity is the main source of vehicle vibration. In this section, the dynamic performance of pantograph-catenary is evaluated with different levels of rail qualities. Without loss of generality, the reference model of pantographcatenary in the benchmark is adopted in the following analyses. A 20-span of catenary is established, and the central 10 spans are selected as an analysis object. The train speed is defined as 320 km/h according to the benchmark [22].

        <p>The geometry of rail is affected by many realistic factors, which exhibit significant stochastics and represent the irregularities of the rail surface. In this paper, the effect of the vehicle-track excitation on the pantograph-catenary interaction is studied with different levels of rail irregularities. The PSD function is a normal representative of the random rail irregularities. As shown in Table 1, the coefficients of the PSD functions of rail irregularities are given with different levels of rail health conditions, which are summarised from the realistic measured data [66]. The rail quality improves with the increase of the level from 1 to 6. The time-history of track irregularities is generated by the inverse Fourier transformation [57]. The frequency spectrum X(k) is obtained by discrete sampling from the standard spectral density function. The real and imaginary parts of X(k) have even and odd symmetries with respect to Nr /2.

In the case of the worst rail quality, the maximum standard deviation reaches 60.77N, which represents a large fluctuation of the contact force. However, the minimal standard deviation is only 50.66N, which is even better than the case without rail irregularities. The rail irregularity also brings a slight variance to the mean contact force. However, when looking at the maximum and minimal values, the negative effect of rail irregularity can be significantly observed.

        <p>According to the standard [67], the statistical maximum and minimal values of the contact force are the important indices to evaluate the dynamic performance of the pantograph-catenary system. As shown in Figure 14(e), some statistical maximum values exceed the safety threshold (350N) in the cases of bad rail quality. Similarly, some statistical minimal values are lower than the safety threshold (0N) except the case of the best rail quality (level 6). Therefore, the vehicle vibration significantly aggravates the safe operation of the pantograph-catenary operation.According to the standard [67], the statistical maximum and minimal values of the contact force are the important indices to evaluate the dynamic performance of the pantograph-catenary system.

        <p>The Yule-Walker method is employed to estimate the spectral density of the contact force calculated by a total of 500 simulations. Figure 18 shows the PSDs of contact force with six levels of rail irregularities. In order to evaluate the contribution of the vehicle vibration to the variance of the contact force, the mean values are subtracted from the results before the PSD estimation. It is seen that the PSD peaks appear at several spatial frequencies relevant to the span length, the half-span length, and the intervals between droppers and steady arms. The degradation of the rail quality results in a general increase of the energy over the entire frequency range of interest, which can be clearly demonstrated by the enlarged region. The random rail irregularity can be seen as a broadband excitation to the pantograph-catenary system, whose contribution is in the whole frequency range, but not at specific frequencies. The maximum deviation reaches 0.26m with the worse rail quality, which still falls in the working range of this type of pantograph. However, the maximum deviation of the contact wire caused by the wind load should not exceed 0.4m [67]. If the extreme condition is considered, the contact point may be outside the safety range. Thus, dewirement assessment is necessary to be performed with extreme conditions (strong wind and poor rail quality) in the future.The Yule-Walker method is employed to estimate the spectral density of the contact force calculated by a total of 500 simulations.

        <p>In this example, only the vertical and lateral vibrations of carbody are included in the pantograph-catenary interaction separately to investigate the potential decoupling of the spatial vibration. Figure 21 shows the time histories of carbody motion with level 6 of track quality, including the lateral displacement, vertical displacement, roll, pitch and yaw of the carbody. In this numerical example, three scenarios of the simulation are performed. In the first one, all the carbody motions are included in the pantographcatenary interaction. The second and third ones only consider the lateral and vertical vibrations of the carbody, respectively. Figure 22 shows the comparison of the contact force between the vertical excitation and 6-DOF excitation. A slight difference can be observed between the two scenarios. The difference of contact force peak reaches 2.5 N. Through the above analysis, it is demonstrated that due to the rotation of the carbody, the lateral and vertical vibrations of the pantograph are coupled. A slight error can be generated if the lateral and vertical vibrations are calculated separately.In this example, only the vertical and lateral vibrations of carbody are included in the pantograph-catenary interaction separately to investigate the potential decoupling of the spatial vibration.
