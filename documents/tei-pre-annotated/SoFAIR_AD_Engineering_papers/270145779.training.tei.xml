        <p>Exploiting this natural resource is straightforward and causes almost no ill effects to the environment. But, while geothermal does not suffer the intermittence of other renewable sources, its extraction efficiency is fairly modest as compared to other sources. As a result, there has been significant interest recently in hybrid systems that integrate geothermal and other forms of energy to increase the output efficiency. This work will survey the different possible integrations involving geothermal energy. A review of the literature shows that the most common hybrid systems implementation involve the integration of geothermal with solar (45% of systems) followed by the integration of a cooling tower into the geothermal system (30% of systems). This work will also investigate the applications for geothermal hybrids and show that 44% of systems are designed for heating applications. Another 44% are used for cooling while only 12% are designed for electrical power generation. Complexity of control remains as the main obstacle facing hybrid multi-source energy systems including those involving geothermal energy.Exploiting this natural resource is straightforward and causes almost no ill effects to the environment.

        <p>As the population of our planet increases, so does the need and demand for energy [1]. Until recently, this demand has been met mostly through the consumption of traditional mainly fossil-based fuels. The consumption of these carbon based fuels has been shown to be directly linked to global warming, pollution and a deterioration of air quality. This issue is of particular concern due to its widespread effect. The latest report by the World Health Organization (WHO) released in May 2018 states that "90 percent of people worldwide breathe polluted air" [1]. Governments around the world are increasingly investing in renewable energy sources (RES) as possible replacements (to some extent) for fossil-based fuels and their ill effects on the environment. RES are able to meet a significant portion of the energy demand without the harmful greenhouse gases and the associated pollution. All forms of RES are being investigated: solar (both photovoltaic and thermal), wind, ocean, marine, hydrostatic, hydrokinetichydropower, as well as geothermal and biomass among others. One of the issues affecting most RES is their stochastic intermittent nature. The energy source is not available all the time, and sometimes it is not sufficient even when available. This is where geothermal energy has an advantage over most other RES, its availability is approximately deterministic and independent of ambient conditions. While it may be geographically limited, wherever geothermal energy is present it is useable all the time at approximately the same level. Geothermal energy has the added advantage of actually attaining lower operating cost compared to traditional systems [3,4].As the population of our planet increases, so does the need and demand for energy [1].

        <p>Another advantage of geothermal energy is that the energy reservoir (the ground) can act as a source as well as a sink depending on the need. Compared to air, soil has a much higher heat capacity.Another advantage of geothermal energy is that the energy reservoir (the ground) can act as a source as well as a sink depending on the need.

        <p>As a result, seasonal variations of soil temperature deep in the ground are much lower than those of the surrounding ambient air. At depths higher than about 20 meters, soil temperature becomes approximately constant year-round. This makes deep earth warmer than ambient air in the winter and 3 cooler in the summer. Ground heat exchangers have been designed to leverage this air-to-soil differential to condition the ambient air temperature.As a result, seasonal variations of soil temperature deep in the ground are much lower than those of the surrounding ambient air.

        <p>The horizontal configuration is typically constructed at a depth less than 1.5 meters [5], while the vertical configuration (commonly known as the borehole heat exchanger (BHE)) typically reaches depths more than 50 meters [6]. Under appropriate circumstances, it is possible to create a combination of vertical and horizontal configurations that will produce better thermal performance [2]. The ground heat exchanger is usually surrounded by grout material (such as cement or a mixture of sand and bentonite) to protect ground water and improve heat transfer. This paper discusses the applicable combinations of geothermal energy with other sources while presenting the main differences between these hybrid systems. Adding the geothermal source could serve mainly in decreasing the operating cost and environmental effects compared to the conventional stand-alone plants. It is very crucial to study geothermal energy and hybridization because the ground is almost considered as a low grade source and consequently it is not preferable to stand alone in a plant.The horizontal configuration is typically constructed at a depth less than 1.5 meters [5], while the vertical configuration (commonly known as the borehole heat exchanger (BHE)) typically reaches depths more than 50 meters [6].

        <p>Geothermal Energy can be used as a source for power generation plants through the use of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) as an example. Replacing the conventional plants with geothermal ones is an attractive methodology to adopt ecofriendly systems [8], because geothermal plants are able to produce much less emissions for the same given load compared to fossil fuels. However, geothermal energy is characterized as a low grade energy source and generally suffers from low energy extraction efficiency. Additional sources of energy can be combined through a hybrid system to improve the efficiency and meet the requirements that geothermal energy alone may not able to deliver [3,4].Geothermal Energy can be used as a source for power generation plants through the use of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) as an example.

        <p>Geothermal energy systems used in heating (or cooling) dominated applications suffer an efficiency degradation due to heat depletion (or accumulation) that may lead to eventual system failure or ground fouling [5][6][7]. Adding a hybrid power source will allow time for recovery and thermal build-up (or dissemination). In addition, hybridization helps in decreasing the required capital and operating costs,investment and hence shortening the payback period of geothermal energy installations as well as addressing high peak loads [8,9]. This could be achieved by taking advantage of the optimal conditions of each source used whereas the major cost of a geothermal system is its initial investment, therefore, this will be significantly reduced by the help of another available abundant one. That's why hybridization is a solution for the high capital cost of geothermal plants and operating cost of other sources.Geothermal energy systems used in heating (or cooling) dominated applications suffer an efficiency degradation due to heat depletion (or accumulation) that may lead to eventual system failure or ground fouling [5][6][7].

        <p>Hybrid Geothermal Systems (HGS) used for heating and cooling applications are commonly encountered in the form of a hybrid ground source heat pump (HGSHP) [10] or a hybrid ground coupled heat pump (HGCHP) [11,12]. Figure 2 shows the difference between the conventional and hybrid ground source heat pump (GSHP) designs.

        <p>Figure 3: Earth Air Heat Exchanger System M. Alavy et al. [15] investigated the use of an HGSHP for district heating and cooling through a common water loop distribution. The system showed high potential that depends mainly on building size and type as well as weather conditions and location. One of the most important parameters to be studied in these hybrid systems is the ratio between the heating and cooling loads in order to design the optimum ground regeneration cycle. Regenerating the ground potential can be achieved by adding a second energy source as mentioned above, or through a traditional HVAC system based on an air source heat pump (ASHP). On the other hand, it is possible to achieve the required regeneration using a dry cooler. The cooler can be used to inject ambient heat in to the cold bore field in the winter and extract it from the warm bore field in the summer. This would require the use of a dual bore field [16]. Choosing the best hybrid system is not straightforward because each HGS has to be considered from a different perspective such as initial or operating cost [17].Figure 3: Earth Air Heat Exchanger System M.

        <p>There is a number of ways that solar and geothermal energies can be integrated to form a hybrid energy system [18]. For example, thermal solar collectors can be used to generate additional heat energy to shore-up any deficit from the geothermal system. A common hybrid solar-geothermal combination is the solar assisted ground source heat pump (SAGSHP) [19]. While there may be different implementations, the main objective of this combination is the reduction in annual operating costs and CO2 emissions. Thermal solar collectors can also be used for ground heat recovery and help stabilize the geothermal system. Conversely, a geothermal heat exchanger can be used as a second heat source to support a solar thermal plant [20][21][22]. This combination has the ability to increase the overall efficiency by 3.6% compared to the combined individual systems [32]. Another motivation for integrating geothermal and solar thermal systems might be the need to increase the steam flow in the geothermal cycle [23]. Researchers have been able to reduce the initial costs associated with a geothermal system by using a solar assisted ground source heat pump to reduce the required borehole heat exchanger field size. It is also possible to use a supercritical ORC based on a geothermal system integrated with a concentrated solar power system to increase peak loads for demand-side management [24,25].

        <p>Solar thermal systems suffer from seasonal deterioration in energy output depending on the sun's position and ambient air temperatures. One way to improve the seasonal coefficients of performance is to use the geothermal system as a seasonal energy storage. A vertical ground heat exchanger may be used to store seasonal excess energy generated by a solar thermal system. The system would be composed of solar collectors, short-term thermal storage devices, a heat pump, and a borehole heat exchanger for long-term storage. A staged series of ground heat exchangers can be used to reduce temperature differences and maintain the effectiveness of the storage system for an elongated period [27]. Ground water flow may be the main limiting factor against the use of such an integration [28]. Ground water flow levels at the site must be low enough to ensure that the induced thermal plume is not dissipated. Researchers have determined that seasonal heat storage is not reliable for solving the thermal imbalance if ground water seepage velocity is large.Solar thermal systems suffer from seasonal deterioration in energy output depending on the sun's position and ambient air temperatures.

        <p>As can be seen from the above examples, integrating a solar thermal system with a geothermal plant can either assist in producing additional power, or reducing the consumed geothermal energy [29]. An essential factor to consider in the design of hybrid solar-geothermal systems is the state of the available ground fluid. If the available fluid is in the steam-liquid state, then a flash cycle (see Figure 4 and Figure 5) would be the preferred design [30,31]. Incorporating the solar system contributes to superheating and evaporating the geothermal fluid and therefore boosting the generated power [32]. A photovoltaic thermal hybrid system (PVT) can be integrated with a GSHP to produce different forms of energy at the same time (as shown in Figure 6). While the GSHP system works on extracting thermal energy from the ground, the PVT system produces electrical energy from the incident sun light and at the same time extracts additional thermal energy from the sun's heat. Careful consideration for the working fluid is necessary to ensure best results from these systems. Most designs have concentrated on using organic fluids [33]. However, it is also possible to use a refrigerant fluid like CO2 in which case the cycle would require some modification such as the incorporation of a reverse trans-critical cycle [34][35][36]. Other studies have also investigated the use of hybrid systems for water distillation in addition to energy generation [37]. Recently, poly-generation and trigeneration systems are more widely spreading to gain extra benefits from the used sources such as in [44] where solar-geothermal system is used for generating electricity, cooling and hydrogen production. The energy and exergy efficiencies were found to be 19.6% and 19.1% respectively. Because of inherent uncertainties and nonlinearities, all of the mentioned hybrid systems suffer from issues related to control. This has motivated researchers to find new control methods such as fuzzy logic (FL) controllers [38] and model predictive control (MPC) [39].As can be seen from the above examples, integrating a solar thermal system with a geothermal plant can either assist in producing additional power, or reducing the consumed geothermal energy [29].

        <p>It has been shown that it is advantageous to incorporate a cooling tower with the ground source heat pump (as shown in Figure 7) to improve the cooling efficiency [13]. This hybrid system is able to maintain soil thermal balance such that in [48], the annual overall COP of the system was found to be 3.96 (3.93 for cooling and 4.09 for heating). The capacity of the cooling tower needs to be chosen taking into consideration the difference between peak and average load values or the cooling load percentages [40,41]. Simulation models have shown that the cooling tower needs to be activated two years after initial heat pump operation. An optimal auxiliary cooling ratio (ACR) needs to be chosen based on the system's configuration (as demonstrated in Figure 8) [42]. It has been recommended in the literature that the cooling tower be integrated in a serial configuration (as depicted in Figure 8) to avoid heat accumulation [44]. In addition, it is necessary to keep the temperature of the water circulating in the cooling tower as low as possible in order to increase the coefficient of performance (COP) [45]. If the cooling load is very high for a standard cooling tower, then a traditional HVAC system can be added to meet the cooling demand [46]. It is also possible to incorporate a second cooling tower that has the same capacity as the ground heat exchanger to serve as an alternator or accumulator [47]. After studying three different strategies for controlling the geothermal-CT system, researchers have determined that the most optimal was the wet bulb temperature control method. This method is based on the difference between outlet fluid temperature and the temperature of wet bulb [48]. The aim of this method is to make full use of heat exchange between air and soil [49]. It concentrates on deriving the most benefit from ambient capacity by prioritizing the use of ambient air as the cooling source. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were developed to predict the temperature of the water existing the GHE in comparison to that of the cooling tower. The ANN showed an absolute error of about 0.2 °C [50].It has been shown that it is advantageous to incorporate a cooling tower with the ground source heat pump (as shown in Figure 7) to improve the cooling efficiency [13].

        <p>Geothermal energy can be used to preheat the organic fluid in a dual-fluid biomass system to achieve the highest possible output power (see Figure 10) [56]. Researchers have determined that it is advisable to integrate a pre-heater and evaporator into the geothermal system to achieve the combined heat and power system improvements [57]. One of the main issues affecting geothermal sourced heat pumps is the thermal imbalance. It has been shown that increasing the size of the heat exchanger can alleviate this issue. However, this may not be always feasible if the available space is limited.

        <p>The most predominant material used in the production of pipes for GHE's is high-density Polyethylene (HDPE). Spacers are typically placed surrounding the pipes to create a gap from the borehole wall and curb the interference between the pipes. These spaces are filled with backfill material making the material characteristics of the backfill one of the most important parameters affecting the performance of borehole heat exchangers. The smaller the particle size of the grout, the more heat it is able to hold. This implies that thermal performance is largely dependent on the size of the particles. Clay, silt, coarse sand etc. are some notable categorize of soil sizes. If a back-fill material with low thermal conductivity us used, this may result in the need for a longer borehole [65,66]. On the other hand, it has been shown that efficiency increases by up to 49% when a standard bentonite grout is utilized instead of sand. A study conducted TRT on 6 different boreholes with double U-pipe exchangers [67]. Backfill materials were made up of bentonite, cement and quartz sand.

        <p>The line source model was also adopted in finding thermal conductivity of grout mix. It was proposed that in the absence of ground water, the grout mix must be made higher compared to the ground thermal conductivity [68]. Thermal resistance tends to decrease when the grout's thermal conductivity increases. Using coaxial borehole heat exchanger made up of grouting material has also been investigated from literature [69]. It was determined that using galvanized steel for the outside coaxial tube instead of polyethylene produced the best results. However, galvanized steel has a shorter life span. The resistance of the borehole reduced to nearly 35% compared to the case study factored into the investigation. These characteristics in terms of the performance are attributed to low material thermal resistance. The borehole resistance (BR) reduced gain by 34% when a mixture of drilling rests was used as grouting material. Using sand mixed with standard cement -bentonite mixture also gave similar results. The application of thermally enhanced grouts did not contribute significantly to the performance compared to the addition of sand to the standard mixture.The line source model was also adopted in finding thermal conductivity of grout mix.

The PCM sand ring went through a melting process in order to harness its high energy content. The length of the borehole reduced by 7.3% when the PCM sand ring was used. There was an increase in the heat pump energy consumption by 2% due to the borehole length being reduced. Increasing the thickness of the ring by 4.1cm causes melting not to exceed the radius of the ring at peak conditions and this also decreases the borehole length by 9.3%.Reducing the borehole length for GHEs in cooled climates has also been investigated [70].

The method of fitting the approximate average into the line -source model results in an increase in the manufacturing cost because of an overestimation of the borehole resistance. Marcotte and Pasquier rather suggest that a p -linear average is considered for estimating the average fluid temperature. The p -linear average was developed based on Incropera and Dewitt's [77] logarithmic mean temperature between water at the entrance and exit. This approach considers a constant temperature around the borehole wall and this is not the real-life scenarios as these temperatures tend to vary on the borehole wall. The 𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡) -linear average approach was also developed for estimating the thermal properties for ground heat exchangers [78]. Lingfeng et al [78] stated in their investigation that the existing 𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡) -linear approach never considered the fact that using undisturbed soil temperature as the reference temperature resulted in the water temperature profile being varied. The 𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡) -linear approach developed by Lingfeng et al [78] shows a relative error of 5% when p = 1, indicating an improvement in existing 𝑝𝑝(𝑡𝑡) -linear method. This approach is ideal for determining borehole thermal resistance. Two critical parameters must be considered as discussed earlier (soil thermal conductivity and borehole resistance). The borehole thermal resistance is directly proportional to the borehole's diameter, pipe size and configuration, material used in making the pipes, as well as the backfill material. It has been deduced that when the soil's thermal conductivity is high, but the borehole's thermal resistance is low, the heat exchange rate will be high [79]. It is therefore imperative that the thermal characteristics of the ground is known before designing the system. The common method for determining ground thermal resistance include soil and rock identification [80], testing of drill cuttings experimentally [81] and inverse heat conduction model [82]. Mogensen in 1983 used the thermal response test to predict ground thermal characteristics [83]. The first design concept was made up of carrier fluid and this was later substituted for a heater. Thermal response test implies injecting heat to the borehole at constant power when the average borehole temperature is specified on the output. The temperature generated over a period of time is reordered as the fluid temperature. This is later evaluated to generate the thermal characteristics of the borehole like the thermal resistance, volumetric specific heat capacity and the conductivity of the soil using inverse heat transfer analysis [84]. There has been several investigations conducted in terms of the number of hours the thermal response test should last. For instance, it is stated from literature that the test con be conducted within 12 -40h [85,86]. The ASHARE handbook also stipulates that the investigation is conducted between 36 -48h [86]. It must be noted that the longer the thermal response test, the more cost involved in the investigation but reducing the timings for the test often produces results that do not reflect the actual thermal conductivity. Further investigations have also contributed to equipment used for thermal response test being reduced [87].𝑇𝑇 𝑏𝑏 : Borehole wall temperature 𝑞𝑞̇ : The heat transfer rate per unit length From literature [76], the usage of the average fluid temperature is not a reflection of all the cases since a constant transfer of heat is considered.
