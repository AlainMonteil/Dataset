        <p>Nanoparticles have shown promise as both drug delivery vehicles and direct antitumor systems, but they must be properly designed in order to maximize efficacy. Computational modeling is often used both to design new nanoparticles and to better understand existing ones. Modeled processes include the release of drugs at the tumor site and the physical interaction between the nanoparticle and cancer cells. In this article, we provide an overview of three different targeted drug delivery methods (passive targeting, active targeting and physical targeting), compare methods of action, advantages, limitations, and the current stage of research. For the most commonly used nanoparticle carriers, fabrication methods are also reviewed. This is followed by a review of computational simulations and models on nanoparticle-based drug delivery.Nanoparticles have shown promise as both drug delivery vehicles and direct antitumor systems, but they must be properly designed in order to maximize efficacy.

        <p>Nanoparticles (NPs) often exhibit different magnetic, thermal, optical and electrical properties due to their high surface area and limited quantum-mechanical effects 1 . NPs are often developed and used as drug carriers, as they can deliver chemotherapeutics targeted to the tumor tissue without damaging normal organs (Fig. 1). The ideal NP carriers should be biodegradable, stable, non-immunogenic, easy to fabricate, cost effective, and able to release their payloads only at the target site 2 .Nanoparticles (NPs) often exhibit different magnetic, thermal, optical and electrical properties due to their high surface area and limited quantum-mechanical effects 1 .

        <p>Medical NPs are often manufactured with a guided bottom-up method, in which engineered macromolecular components are guided by external stimuli to interact with each other and self-assemble into complex structures that otherwise would not be possible 3 .

        <p>Medical nanoparticles, despite their name, are far from the smallest things that scientists and engineers work with. Rather, they occupy a manufacturing blind spot located between large and small structures. Objects and materials with features at, and larger than, the microscale are now readily fabricated through "top-down" approaches like lithography and precision machining. Objects smaller than nanoparticles are generally easily synthesized through "bottom-up" methods in which individual chemicals essentially assemble themselves under the influence of intermolecular forces. Nanoparticles are too large and complex to be made by simply mixing their molecular components in a test tube, but much too small to be assembled with even the highest precision lithographic device. The solution is a guided bottom-up approach, in which macromolecular components are engineered to interact with each other and often external stimuli fields and self-assemble into structures more complex than would otherwise be possible 3 .Medical nanoparticles, despite their name, are far from the smallest things that scientists and engineers work with.

        <p>While there are many types of self-assembled nanoparticles, the most studied can broadly be sorted by structure. Below is an introduction, with examples, to amphiphilic NPs (the most common type of drug carrying NP), followed by a brief explanation of other novel NP structures: dendrimers, polyrotaxanes, functionalized carbon nanotubes, graphene, and metal solid-core nanoparticles. It is important to note that all of these NPs can be functionalized to actively target specific sites in and on tumor cells.While there are many types of self-assembled nanoparticles, the most studied can broadly be sorted by structure.

        <p>The earliest drug NPs were biomimetic in nature, mimicking the micelles and liposomes already present in the body. These NPs contain macromolecules with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. In an aqueous environment such as blood or cellular fluid, the hydrophobic regions will cluster together in order to be shielded from the surrounding polar water, forming a micelle. Synthetic micelles have hydrophobic cores, while more complex amphiphiles can form full liposomes with a double-layered macromolecular wall and a hydrophilic core with the same or different properties as the surrounding fluid (Fig. 2). Drugs can be captured either in the core or on the surface of these particles, depending on their hydrophobicity. In either case, the drug is shielded from removal by the immune system and from other in vivo hazards.The earliest drug NPs were biomimetic in nature, mimicking the micelles and liposomes already present in the body.

        <p>An early example of micelle-forming particles involved poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(aspartic acid) block copolymers (PEO-PAA) 13 . These polymers were used to create a selfassembling micelle containing the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX). DOX is commonly used to test the efficacy of self-assembling carriers, and comes in both hydrophobic and hydrophilic HCl formulations -it can be assumed to be hydrophobic unless stated otherwise. In this case, DOX was bound to the hydrophobic PAA polymer in organic solvent and then pushed through a membrane into an aqueous solution, a technique known variously as membrane dialysis or diafiltration. This transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic solution induces the formation of micelles and leaves DOX encapsulated at the PAA center. The resulting nanoparticle was extremely soluble and stable in water, increasing the half-life of the payload drug.An early example of micelle-forming particles involved poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(aspartic acid) block copolymers (PEO-PAA) 13 .

        <p>A similar experiment was carried out with an amphiphilic pullulan acetate polymer 14 . Cancer cells have been shown to overexpress vitamin H, so the polymer was functionalized with it in order to actively target these cancer cells. After DOX was loaded into the micelles using membrane dialysis, the authors found that the amount of vitamin H expressed on the surface of the nanoparticle correlated with its uptake by cancer cells, indicating successful active targeting.A similar experiment was carried out with an amphiphilic pullulan acetate polymer 14 .

        <p>More complex micelles can be engineered to release their payloads in response to external stimulation. Bae et al. 15 had designed pH-sensitive nanoparticle carriers which follows previous reports on poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(aspartate-hydrazone) copolymers. DOX was bound to the hydrazone group and micelles were again formed through membrane dialysis. Hydrazone bonds are easily cleaved in acidic conditions, so this micelle was designed to expose DOX in response to low pH. Micelles are taken up by cells through endocytosis and subsequently engulfed by lysosomes, which have a pH of around 5 and thus trigger drug release. The authors found that DOX concentration decreased as a function of pH, with around 30% of the drug released at a pH of 5 and the entire payload released at lower pH.More complex micelles can be engineered to release their payloads in response to external stimulation.

        <p>A particularly interesting trigger-based nanoparticle was created by combining the pH responsive polymer poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) with the heat sensitive poly(Nisopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) 16 . PNIPAM becomes hydrophobic above its lower critical solution temperature of around 32°C, while PAA becomes hydrophobic at a pH below 4.8. The copolymer will thus form a micelle with a PNIPAM core at high temperature and pH, but flip to a PAA core at low temperature and pH. PAA also binds to DOX in aqueous solution, eliminating the need for organic solvents or membrane dialysis. When it binds at low temperature and high pH, the PAA-DOX complex becomes hydrophobic and forms micelles. This nanoparticle was shown to exhibit drug release both with an increase in temperature (which causes the micelle to flip inside-out and expose DOX to the environment) and a drop in pH (which causes PAA to protonate and release the less positive DOX). PNIPAM has also been used to synthesize nanoparticles that can shrink in volume in response to temperature 17 .A particularly interesting trigger-based nanoparticle was created by combining the pH responsive polymer poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) with the heat sensitive poly(Nisopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) 16 .

        <p>Polymer nanoparticles have also been made with hybrid polymer-lipid amphiphiles, which allow for a broader range of potential polymers. This system was used in a nanoparticle able to hold both drugs and DNA using a cationic core-shell system 18 . The main polymer chain is hydrophilic poly(N-methyldietheneamine sebacate) (PMDS) grafted with the hydrophobic N-(2-bromoethyl) carbarmoyl cholesterol lipid to form an amphiphilic copolymer. The antitumor drug Paclitaxel (PTX) was encapsulated through membrane dialysis, and luciferase-coding DNA was bound to the nanoparticle in order to detect fluorescence. It was found that cancer cells successfully expressed luciferase, indicating successful endocytosis. Lipids can also be used as a molecular shield to increase drug half-life in blood 19 .Polymer nanoparticles have also been made with hybrid polymer-lipid amphiphiles, which allow for a broader range of potential polymers.

        <p>It is also possible to change the chemistry of certain polymers to distort the resulting nanoparticle 20 . Micelles can be created in a variety of non-spherical shapes using poly[oligo(ethyleneglycol)methacrylate]-block-[poly(styrene)-copoly(vinyl benzaldehyde)] block polymers. The shape of the micelles changed from sphere to rod as the degree of polymerization for the P(ST-co-VBA) blocks increased. DOX was able to be loaded into the micelles as normal.It is also possible to change the chemistry of certain polymers to distort the resulting nanoparticle 20 .

        <p>Huang et al. 21 designed a poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticle coated with sgc8 aptamer capable of carrying both a hydrophobic and hydrophilic cancer drug. After selfassembly, hydrophilic DOX is located in the poly(ethylene-glycol) shell and hydrophobic paclitaxel is located in the PLGA core. The sgc8 aptamer causes the nanoparticle to be internalized by cancer cells specifically, an example of active targeting. The authors show that the multidrug combo was more effective than either drug individually at reducing cell viability, and the addition of a second drug had an insignificant effect on the viability of normal cells. It is also possible to use transferrin on the nanoparticles to increase uptake by cancer cells 22 .Huang et al. 21 designed a poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticle coated with sgc8 aptamer capable of carrying both a hydrophobic and hydrophilic cancer drug.

        <p>Xia et al. 23 designed silk-elastin protein polymer nanoparticles. Silk-elastin-like proteins are synthetic genetically engineered proteins designed to mimic the properties of both silk and elastin. The proteins are temperature-dependent amphiphiles and will form micelles. In this case, it was shown that DOX actually triggered micelle formation in some cases by increasing the hydrophobicity of the silk-end chains. The authors reason that this polymer and method of self-assembly, since it is formed biologically in non-extreme environments, will generate fewer toxins and be a safer alternative to traditional methods.Xia et al. 23 designed silk-elastin protein polymer nanoparticles.

        <p>An example of a novel nanoparticle structure is a dendrimer, which is a repeatedly branching nanostructure that mimics the structure of tree branches and blood vessels 7 . This shape is shown to both generate large surface areas and disperse a surface more evenly throughout the structure. Dendrimers are commonly made of poly(amidoamine), but can also be made from other polymers. It has been shown that dendrimers can be used to target cancer cells with high accuracy 26 . Lam et al reported a novel class of micelles made of linear PEG and dendritic cholic acids (CA) block copolymers (called telodendrimers) 27 . By crosslinking the boronate esters at the core-shell interface, the stability of these micelles can be improved (Fig. 4) 28 . As the crosslinking reactants, boronic acid and catechol were added to the polymers through step-wise peptide chemistry.An example of a novel nanoparticle structure is a dendrimer, which is a repeatedly branching nanostructure that mimics the structure of tree branches and blood vessels 7 .

        <p>Rotaxanes are molecular linkages in which a cyclic molecule encircles a dumbbell-shaped one -the cyclic molecule can rotate but cannot slide off of the dumbbell. Polyrotaxanes can be a useful tool for drug delivery 29 . Liu et al. attached cyclic cyclodextrin to poly(ethylene glycol) chains in order to form a nanoparticle. Hydrophobic cinnamic acid was attached to the ends of the PEG chains in order to increase the space between the cyclodextrin rings, providing space for DOX to bind. This system can also be used to transport the drug methotrexate 24 .Rotaxanes are molecular linkages in which a cyclic molecule encircles a dumbbell-shaped one -the cyclic molecule can rotate but cannot slide off of the dumbbell.

        <p>Dendrimers and Rotaxanes are used primarily for drug delivery, but the next three structures are also often used in thermal therapy, where a localized temperature increase is used to destroy a tumor. Graphene is a single atom-thick hexagonal allotrope of carbon with novel electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. Because of its high surface area, it is useful as a drug carrier, and its structure makes it efficient at converting infrared light into heat. It is, however, relatively toxic, and must be stabilized and shielded through the addition of polymers to its surface 25,30 . Carbon nanotubes are rolled tubes of graphene that exhibit many of the same properties. Nanotubes have been used as hybrid drug carries, where the antitumor drug is released only in a specific site when bombarded with near-infrared radiation and the NPs are heated up. This can help to limit drug release to the tumor site and protect healthy tissue 31,32 .Dendrimers and Rotaxanes are used primarily for drug delivery, but the next three structures are also often used in thermal therapy, where a localized temperature increase is used to destroy a tumor.

        <p>Oligopeptides have been extensively studied as nanocarriers due to their intrinsic pH sensitivity resulting from amino acids. Zhang et al. developed a liposome system based on zwitterionic oligopeptide lipids as nanocarriers 34 . The amino acid-based lipids, 1,5dioctadecyl-L-glutamyl 2-histidylhexahydrobenzoic acid (HHG2C 18 ) and 1,5-distearyl N-(N-α-(4-mPEG2000) butanedione)-histidyl-L-glutamate (PEGHG2C 18 ), have a multistage pH-response to the tumor microenvironmental pH (pH 6.8) then the endo/lysosomal pH (pH 4.5) successively. Supramolecular polymers have significant potential application in drug delivery due to their reversible monomer-to-polymer transitions. Fig. 5 shows the molecular unit designed to form a supramolecular architecture 35 . The pair is a peptide amphiphile monomer composed of three segments: a biological signal-bearing sequence, an amino acid-contained domain, and a hydrophobic alkyl tail. These monomers can form a cylindrical aggregate where twisted β sheets (red) collapse through hydrophobic interactions among alkyl chains, resulting in high signal densities. The blue regions represent water domains present in the assembly interior.Oligopeptides have been extensively studied as nanocarriers due to their intrinsic pH sensitivity resulting from amino acids.

        <p>There are many challenges that arise in the early and late stage development of medical nanoparticles that are either nonexistent or minimal in non-nanoparticle based therapies 36 . The primary driver of these issues is the hierarchical and non-uniform nature of nanoparticles, which means that a small change in a single property can have outsized effects on the pharmacokinetics or therapeutic efficacy of the particle. As an example, one common issue is maintaining a narrow distribution of particle size. For most applications, a particle size under 200nm is desirable. With a broad normal distribution of sizes, this means that often the average particle must be too small to be useful in order to limit the number of particles over 200nm. It is thus desirable to have a manufacturing process that ensures a narrow size distribution.There are many challenges that arise in the early and late stage development of medical nanoparticles that are either nonexistent or minimal in non-nanoparticle based therapies 36 .

        <p>In addition, many unique challenges can arise during the trial and production stages of the nanoparticle. Oftentimes, a procedure for nanoparticle formation that works in a lab setting will not work in a factory, and the synthesis steps must be completely reworked. In a factory, the variation in nanoparticle structure must be smaller, the yield must be higher, and the synthesis must be more sterile than what is acceptable in a lab. All of these things can make a particle unviable to produce even if it works. If a particle is sold, it must be shelf-stable, which means that it both will not degrade in solution and that it will not clump over time, as nanoparticles often do. Finally, nanoparticles face extra regulatory challenges as their toxicity is much more difficult to determine than that of a small molecule. This greatly increases the time and cost of clinical trials. These challenges combined mean that it is always prudent to consider questions of scalability and reproducibility even at the earliest stages of development to prevent failure at a later stage.In addition, many unique challenges can arise during the trial and production stages of the nanoparticle.

        <p>Cancer cells are otherwise normal cells with unique mutations in genes regulating growth, which cause them to divide uncontrollably and give them the ability to metastasize 37 . Cancer cells successfully compete with normal cells for oxygen, glucose, and amino acids for division and growth, but a tumor can only grow to about 2mm 3 without forming blood vessels (angiogenesis) [38][39][40] . There are more than one hundred types of cancer, more than 85% of which are solid 40 . Current treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy 40 . However, the inability of drugs to specifically target cancer cells hinders most treatment 2,41,42 . It is often quicker and cheaper to design a more effective way to better target an existing drug than to develop an entirely new one. Drug delivery targeting is classified as passive, active, or physical, and can target organs, cells, or organelles. Organelle targeting is an especially promising field of research, as many cancers specifically affect a single one, and certain organelles provide alternative paths for drug localization.Cancer cells are otherwise normal cells with unique mutations in genes regulating growth, which cause them to divide uncontrollably and give them the ability to metastasize 37 .

        <p>Drugs delivered intravenously tend to evenly disperse throughout the body. However, tumor cells tend to take up particles of a certain size to a greater degree than healthy cells due to a combination of leaky tumor blood vessels and faulty particle screening. This is known as the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect (Fig. 6) and is the mechanism behind passive targeting 43 .Drugs delivered intravenously tend to evenly disperse throughout the body.

        <p>The EPR effect is influenced by NP properties including particle size, shape, and surface charge, and it in turn influences circulation time, penetration speed, and intracellular internalization [44][45] . For example, phagocytic cells favor the uptake of larger particles, while non-phagocytic cells favor the uptake of smaller particles 46 . It has been consistently shown that PEGylated nanoparticles smaller than 100nm have reduced plasma protein adsorption on their surface and reduced hepatic filtration 47 .

        <p>An alternative way to improve the uptake of NPs, both passive and active, has been to functionalize their surfaces with cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). It has been found that certain short (~30 amino acids) peptide sequences can pierce cell membranes and transport drug cargo into a cell. These CPPs can be attached to micelles, liposomes, and other types of NPs 59 . Certain CPPs can also act as drug carriers on their own, carrying small molecules and short stretches of DNA into cells 59 . Most CPPs are amphiphilic, with a net positive charge. Because they are shaped similar to lysing peptides, certain CPPs can exert unwanted toxic side effects.An alternative way to improve the uptake of NPs, both passive and active, has been to functionalize their surfaces with cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs).

        <p>Active targeting uses ligands bound to the NP surface to improve their uptake selectivity. These ligands can react with target cells and will often protect NPs from enzyme destruction. Ligands with a high binding affinity to the target cell will strongly increase delivery efficiency. The most basic form of active targeting involves functionalizing a NP with a ligand that binds to a molecule overexpressed on cancer cells. The issue with this, of course, is that healthy cells still express the same molecule, and as healthy cells greatly outnumber tumor cells most of the NPs miss their target. This issue can be mitigated by using multiple ligands, or by using ligands of different types.Active targeting uses ligands bound to the NP surface to improve their uptake selectivity.

        <p>Many antibodies have been approved for use in clinical treatment by the FDA, such as rituximab, Ipilimumab, and trastuzumab 70 . Antibodies are among the most studied ligands because of their high specificity and availability. An antibody conjugated dendrimer was found to bind exclusively to human prostate adenocarcinoma (LNCaP) cells that express PSmA(J591) 26 . Although antibodies have many merits, they are difficult to conjugate to NPs, result in a short circulation time, and are expensive. Peptides are a promising alternative, as they are smaller, simpler, more stable, and easier to produce. Among peptides, RGD is often used due to its strong binding with αvβ3 integrin receptors. Nucleic acid base aptamers combine the advantages of both antibodies and peptides, but they degrade quickly. Other small molecules can also be used as ligands, such as folic acid for folate receptors 71 . Such molecules are small, stable, and easy to produce. Unfortunately, ligand detection for relevant substrates is challenging. Even with proper binding ligands and receptors, binding incompatibility can limit therapeutic efficiency. Multiple ligands with different charges can increase overall the binding affinity, but the limited binding ability and capacity of receptors will govern the quantity and quality of the binding.

In the microvascularture, a convection-diffusion-reaction model was developed for nanoparticle concentration studies. G. Fullstone 80 used flexible large-scale agent based modeling (FLAM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to study NP distribution in capillaries. In the microvasculature, red blood cells aid NP dispersion to the vessel walls and modify the EPR effect. It was reported that larger NPs (submicron size) are more likely to be pushed to the vessel walls than smaller NPs, which in turn gives them a greater chance of permeating through diseased vasculatures to reach the target cells 80 . NP adhesion with endothelial cells modeled with IMEFEM suggests that NP shape affect adhesion, with spherical NPs having a lower lateral drift velocity compared with ellipsoids. A NPs binding probability can be simulated by randomly assigning initial positions of nanoparticles at the channel inlet, applying a Brownian adhesion dynamics model, conducting a number of independent trials, calculating the average of number of bonded nanoparticles, and then normalizing the total number of nanoparticles for a certain depletion layer thickness and shear rate.

The fundamental mechanisms of each process needs to be better understood, and can be aided by smarter experimental design. Each of the computational models has its limitations. Most of the current mechanistic models focus on a particular process instead of coupling with each other to simulate the entire process from drug to patient. Linking models of different temporal and spatial scales is challenging but will provide the greatest benefit in terms of accuracy.Computational modeling has not been widely used in pharmaceutical industry for drug delivery design due to its limited predictability and accuracy.

        <p>Mechanistic models require high quality data for parameter estimation, model calibration, validation, and error analysis. To track molecules and nanoparticles in living cells and tissues over time is challenging, so in vitro data for more physiologically realistic simulations is also needed. Repeated experiments are needed to build physiological and delivery system variable statistical distributions. Uncertainty quantification and updating is required for connecting lower scale level atomistic models with higher scale level continuum models as error from one part of the simulation can propagate leading to an unacceptable solution.Mechanistic models require high quality data for parameter estimation, model calibration, validation, and error analysis.

        <p>NPs are good candidates for targeted drug delivery carriers. They are widely available, easily functionalized with good biocompatibility and stability. Concentrated doses of toxic drugs can be encapsulated and delivered by the nanoparticles directly to the tumor site. Currently there are three delivery strategies: Passive targeting, which relies on the EPR effect; Active targeting, which uses ligand-receptor interactions for more selective drug delivery; and nextgeneration photothermal and magnetic hybrid NPs, where drugs release is controlled in both time and location using heat generated by the photothermal or magnetic nanoparticle. Physical targeting is still at the clinical trial stage.NPs are good candidates for targeted drug delivery carriers.

        <p>NPs can self-assemble into different structures, including amphiphilic micelles and liposomes, as well as more exotic rotaxanes, dendrimers, and metal core particles. Each of these particles has specific strengths and weaknesses and is suitable for the delivery of different therapies to different regions. The choice of a nanoparticle has much to do with the application in mind-there is not yet a gold standard. Most typical NPs used as drug delivery carriers are micelles and liposomes, but there is increasing research into other particles. Rotaxanes can release cargo in response to a tailored stimulus, while dendrimers can sometimes maximize surface area and cargo capacity when compared with simple spherical structures. In addition, metal-core particles are a good choice for physical and combination physical-active or physical-passive targeting.NPs can self-assemble into different structures, including amphiphilic micelles and liposomes, as well as more exotic rotaxanes, dendrimers, and metal core particles.

        <p>Experimental development of these NPs is challenging, as size, shape, and surface charge must all be controlled to carry drugs to the target site. Inappropriate physical parameters not only can compromise drug delivery efficacy but also cause serious side effects. Developed NPs have to be tested in both living cells and tissue first before they can be moved to in vivo tests. Environmental differences can also impact drug delivery efficacy. Due to the complexities of the drug delivery process and the large amount of uncertainty involved, computational modeling is mostly applied for NP design optimization. Currently, they are not used widely in the pharmaceutical industry due to their poor predictability. Most models only focus on specific processes in drug delivery instead of full simulations from the drug to the patient scale. Multiscale modeling across different temporal and spatial scales is rare.Experimental development of these NPs is challenging, as size, shape, and surface charge must all be controlled to carry drugs to the target site.

        <p>In the future, NP design can be better guided by multiscale modeling. However, experiments also provide needed data for model calibration, validation, and help to understand the mechanisms unique to each drug delivery process. Multiscale models that take in personalized data, such as MRI scanned vascular network image, genome, family history, targeted cell receptor density, and the physical-chemical properties of NPs should be further improved and validated in clinical settings. Collaborative work of computation and experiment is already used for more efficient nanocarrier design. Shi, et al 93 used molecular docking/MD simulation to screen building blocks for nanocarrier synthesis. Their models were validated with experimental synthesis and evaluations of nanocarrier library. Jiang, et al 94 employed multiscale modeling together with experiments to understand the building blocks' role in telodendrimer self-assembly process.
