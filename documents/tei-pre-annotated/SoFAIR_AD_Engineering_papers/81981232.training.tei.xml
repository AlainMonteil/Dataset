        <p>An in-depth historical and current review is presented on the science of lithium-ion battery (LIB) solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on the graphite anode, including structure, morphology, composition, electrochemistry, and formation mechanism. During initial LIB operation, the SEI layer forms on the graphite surfaces, the most common anode material. The SEI is essential to the long-term performance of LIBs, and it also has an impact on its initial capacity loss, self-discharge characteristics, rate capability, and safety. While the presence of the anode SEI is vital, it is difficult to control its formation and growth, as they depend on several factors. These factors include the type of graphite, electrolyte composition, electrochemical conditions, and temperature. Thus, SEI formation and electrochemical stability over long-term operation should be a primary topic of future investigation in the LIB development. This article covers the progression of knowledge regarding the SEI, from its discovery in 1979 to the current state of understanding, and covers differences in the chemical and structural makeup when cell materials and components are varied. It also discusses the relationship of the SEI layer to the LIB formation step, involving both electrolyte wetting and subsequent slow chargeedischarge cycles to grow the SEI.An in-depth historical and current review is presented on the science of lithium-ion battery (LIB) solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on the graphite anode, including structure, morphology, composition, electrochemistry, and formation mechanism.

        <p>Much effort has been put into lithium-ion battery (LIB) development for electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid electrical vehicles (PHEVs), and other electrical system applications [1e11]. Some of the key studies have involved reducing cost, increasing capacity retention, and improving efficiency [2,4e7,12e16]. During the operation of LIBs, a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (also called "solid electrolyte interface" in some literature) forms on the graphite surface, the most commonly used anode material, due to side reactions with the electrolyte solvent and salt. It is accepted that the SEI layer is essential to the performance of LIBs, and it has an impact on its initial capacity loss, self-discharge characteristics, cycle life, rate capability and safety.

        <p>This paper is a comprehensive review of the science of the LIB anode SEI layer and its relationship to electrolyte wetting, formation cycling, and cell lifetime. It spans from the basic science of the SEI formation interfacial physics and reaction mechanisms to the applied science of reducing formation cycle time and increasing LIB lifetime. The time period covered is from the discovery of lithiumion intercalation in graphite (1979) up to the present day, and it offers insights into the SEI formation mechanism, chemical and morphological properties of the SEI, and relationship to formation cycling and cell lifetime. This paper will appeal to the entire LIB research community and the broader energy storage community as a whole. Given that it deals with an intricate combination of surface chemistry, electrochemistry, and reaction mechanisms, it will also appeal to chemists and chemical scientists in other fields.This paper is a comprehensive review of the science of the LIB anode SEI layer and its relationship to electrolyte wetting, formation cycling, and cell lifetime.

        <p>The anode SEI layer is formed from the so-called "lithium inventory" of the cathode and electrolyte salt, which is the total amount of lithium available for building the SEI and initial charging of the cell, and there is a delicate balance between the ideal surface area the anode should have and the energy and power density of an LIB. The entirety of the anode surface must have the SEI layer present to prevent further undesired decomposition of the electrolyte, which consumes Li ions. The amount of Li ion loss from the cathode directly affects the first-cycle irreversible capacity (energy density), while losing Li ions from the electrolyte lowers liquidphase mass transport and increases electrolyte resistance thereby decreasing power density [1,17]. During the first full cycle, 10% of the original capacity is generally consumed in irreversible SEI formation [18]. Therefore, the total surface of the anode should be minimized from an energy density or cell cost standpoint. However, the minimization comes with a performance tradeoff e low anode surface area means lower power density (capacity at high C rates) with solid-state diffusion limitations. In contrast, high anode surface area is beneficial to power density, but much greater lithium inventory is consumed when passivating the surface to form the SEI layer, thereby decreasing energy density. Section 7 includes an overview and understanding of carbon/graphite properties and related SEI formation.The anode SEI layer is formed from the so-called "lithium inventory" of the cathode and electrolyte salt, which is the total amount of lithium available for building the SEI and initial charging of the cell, and there is a delicate balance between the ideal surface area the anode should have and the energy and power density of an LIB.

        <p>There is also a secondary connection of the SEI layer to LIB safety, and it comes into play once the anode is fully passivated. To avoid lithium plating or dendrite formation at the anode during charging over the life of the cell, capacity is often kept about 10% more than that at cathode [18] (N/P ratio of 1.1 where "N" is the negative electrode, or anode during cell discharging, and "P" is the positive electrode, or cathode during cell discharging) to prevent internal electrical shorts. Therefore, this extra anode material must also undergo SEI layer passivation adding to the cell cost and diminishing the total cell energy. Optimizing the N/P ratio is important for minimizing initial lithium inventory loss and decreasing initial irreversible capacity. For long-term capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency, optimizing only the capacity ratio would be insufficient because SEI continuously grows and consumes electrolytes and lithium ions when it is not well formed [19,20].There is also a secondary connection of the SEI layer to LIB safety, and it comes into play once the anode is fully passivated.

        <p>Better understanding of the state-of-the-art graphite SEI layer composition and morphology is an important step towards growing improved SEI layers that prevent continuous decomposition of electrolyte on the graphite surfaces. The anode SEI layer is composed of precipitates from reduced decomposition of solvents, salts, lithium ions, and impurities in the electrolyte due to their instability at the anode potential operating window [1,21]. It forms mostly during the first charge, but the formation continues slowly and gradually after first cycle until the SEI layer is fully developed, adding to the complexity of modern LIB formation protocols. An optimized SEI layer is expected to have negligible electrical conductivity and high electrolyte diffusion resistance while having high lithium ion selectivity and permeability. Once it is properly formed, further decomposition reactions with salts and solvents are prevented since electrons cannot transfer to or through the layer (the increased electronic resistance increases the potential on the graphite surface and shifts the surface potential to within the stability window of the electrolyte). However, in reality, the SEI layer gradually thickens during repeated chargeedischarge cycles due to electron exposure to electrolyte or electrolyte diffusion to the graphite surface, although the layer thickness growth after a few chargeedischarge cycles is not nearly as great as the amount during the first cycle. The gradual thickening of the layer further consumes Li ions, solvents, and salts and increases cell resistance. This continuous SEI layer growth during the formation cycling process lowers cell capacity and Coulombic efficiency.Better understanding of the state-of-the-art graphite SEI layer composition and morphology is an important step towards growing improved SEI layers that prevent continuous decomposition of electrolyte on the graphite surfaces.

        <p>It is worth mentioning briefly that a "SEI-like" layer forms on cathodes, as well, by oxidation reactions of electrolytes at high potentials [22,23], but its impact on cell performance is generally less. Recent studies involving lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) NMC materials (Li 1þx Ni y Mn z Co 1-x-y-z O 2 ) for EV applications, show high capacities when operated at high voltage [3,14,24e28]. This cathode material has an operating window of 2e4.8 V vs Li/Li þ and capacities of 200e250 mAh/g [24], but only 150 mAh/g within the typical operating voltage window (3e4.2 V) [15]. As the voltage approaches 4.7 V vs Li/Li þ (or even less), decomposition takes place on cathode surface during charge or storage by oxidation of electrolyte solvent organic carbonates (ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate ethyl methyl carbonate, propylene carbonate, etc.) [21,22,29,30]. Since these carbonates have oxidation (highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)) and reduction potentials (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) around 4.7 V and 1 V vs Li/Li þ , respectively [21], they are decomposed by electroreduction at the anode below 1 V and by electro-oxidation at the cathode above 4.7 V during charging or storage. The oxidation potentials of these carbonates are further reduced at elevated temperature (LIBs in vehicles or portable devices experience locally increased temperatures) to 4 V at 40 C and 3.8 V at 60 C [22,30e35]. Ethers and esters are not typically stable above 4 V [36,37]. Other species in the electrolyte, such as lithium compounds that are partially reduced at the anode and diffuse to the cathode, have even lower oxidation potentials. Wursig et al. reported SEI formation at 4.3 V vs Li/Li þ and even at 25 C on various cathode materials [38]. Hence, at high potentials, cathodes suffer from increases in resistance from SEI-like passivation layers as well as from loss or migration of active materials such as Mn and Co. When initial chargeedischarge cycles and storage time are extended, the resistance at the cathode increases even more than that of the anode [39].It is worth mentioning briefly that a "SEI-like" layer forms on cathodes, as well, by oxidation reactions of electrolytes at high potentials [22,23], but its impact on cell performance is generally less.

        <p>Despite the importance of understanding the formation, composition, morphology, and long-term structural and chemical evolution of the anode SEI layer, these topics are not yet fully understood because of analysis and measurement difficulties. In fact, the SEI layer formation mechanism is much less understood than the resultant chemical and physical properties themselves. The SEI is quite thin, a few hundreds of angstroms, and sensitive to moisture and oxygen in the air that may convert SEI components into different forms before or during analysis [40e42]. Because of the environmental sensitivity, SEI analysis requires inert and wellcontrolled conditions.Despite the importance of understanding the formation, composition, morphology, and long-term structural and chemical evolution of the anode SEI layer, these topics are not yet fully understood because of analysis and measurement difficulties.

        <p>Functional properties for an ideal SEI layer are high electrical resistance and high lithium selectivity and permeability. Physical ones are a thickness close to a few Å, high strength, tolerance to expansion and contraction stresses (the SEI layer must accommodate expanding and contracting sub-surfaces during charging and discharging, respectively), insolubility in the electrolyte, and stability at a wide range of operating temperatures and potentials. Actual SEI layers seem to not yet have enough of these properties because it has been found that they keep growing over repeated chargeedischarge cycles. This growth is closely related to lithium loss from both the electrolyte salt and cathode lithium inventory, as well as lithium diffusion resistance at the liquid interfacial zone adjacent to the SEI layer and within the SEI itself. The lithium consumption and diffusion resistance cause an increase not only in the overall cell resistance but also in anode potential. The increase in the anode potential is attributed to a lower number of Li ions in the electrode after consumption at the SEI. This increased anode potential also induces a similar increase in cathode potential to maintain a charge cutoff potential. When the cathode potential increases and reaches a certain point, the cathode crystal structure rearranges and distorts due to oxygen loss and transition metal shifting [3,14,24,25]. The electrolyte also becomes less stable at higher cathode potentials, which leads to solvent oxidation on the cathode surface (for example LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate (EC): dimethyl carbonate (DMC)) is oxidized around 4.5 V vs Li/Li þ during charging [43e47]. This gradual SEI growth on the anode negatively affects cathode potential and stability. Therefore, forming a robust and stable SEI layer on the anode carbon/graphite is essential for long LIB lifetime and high capacity retention.Functional properties for an ideal SEI layer are high electrical resistance and high lithium selectivity and permeability.

        <p>SEI formation generally takes days because scan rates are slow, ~±C/5 down to ~±C/20 [13,15], to form a denser SEI structure rather than a highly porous one. After the first chargeedischarge cycle, formation cycles generally repeat at different scan rates and/or different temperatures to build quality SEI layers. The longer the times and greater the number of chargeedischarge cycles, the more expensive the process becomes, which also either lowers cell production rate or increases capital expense (i.e. more cycling stations required). If the electrical energy is not "recycled" (i.e. using the energy of one cell after charging it from the primary electricity source to charge another adjacent cell), the cost further increases. Reducing the time for SEI formation would provide higher production rates without needing extra space, equipment, and energy, eventually reducing battery pack and plant costs.SEI formation generally takes days because scan rates are slow, ~±C/5 down to ~±C/20 [13,15], to form a denser SEI structure rather than a highly porous one.

        <p>In LIBs an aprotic salt solution with low-molecular-weight organic solvents are the most widely used electrolytes. These electrolytes undergo decomposition at the graphite anode, and the SEI layer is formed from these decomposition products, which then dictates initial performance of the cell and long-term capacity fade characteristics. Therefore, the question is can the electrolyte decomposition be minimized or controlled to provide predictable performance of the cell.In LIBs an aprotic salt solution with low-molecular-weight organic solvents are the most widely used electrolytes.

        <p>Fig. 1 shows the relative electron energies of the anode, electrolyte, and cathode of a thermodynamically stable redox pair in a LIB. In the figure, m A and m C are the electrochemical potentials of the anode and cathode respectively. The stability window of the electrolyte is the difference between the energy of the LUMO and HOMO. This window is shown as E g . If m A is above the LUMO energy, then it will reduce the electrolyte, and, likewise, if m C is below the HOMO energy, it will oxidize the electrolyte. The energy separation between the anode and cathode needs to be as high as possible to increase the energy density of the redox pair. The organic electrolytes used in LIBs have oxidation potentials around 4.7 V vs. Li þ /Li and reduction potentials close to 1.0 V vs. Li þ /Li. The intercalation potential of Li into graphite is between 0 V and 0.25 V vs. Li þ /Li, which is below the reduction potential of the electrolyte. Thus, the potential of the graphite electrodes falls below the stability window of the electrolyte during charging, and it decomposes at the graphite surface forming the SEI.Fig. 1 shows the relative electron energies of the anode, electrolyte, and cathode of a thermodynamically stable redox pair in a LIB.

        <p>If all of the decomposition reaction potentials for the SEI formation are more positive than the anode Li ion intercalation potential, the SEI would form more completely under fast kinetics before the onset of the intercalation reaction. Once it is well formed, the SEI should have high Li-ion conductivity and negligible electronic conductivity. The electronically insulating property of the SEI prevents further reduction of the electrolyte on the graphite surface, while the ion conductive nature allows permeation of lithium ions to the graphite surface and provides pathways for the desired ion intercalation. To avoid cracking of SEI layers due to stress from a volume change of graphite during intercalation and de-intercalation and to avoid further passivation reactions, the molecular force between the SEI layer and graphite surface should be strong. Physically, the SEI layer should be strong or flexible enough to accommodate the volume change (expansion during charging and contraction during discharging) of the anode during the cycling process. Ideally, the SEI layer should be uniformly distributed over the graphite surfaces. The chemical composition of the SEI should contain stable and insoluble compact inorganic compounds such as Li 2 CO 3 rather than metastable organic compounds such as ROLi and ROCO 2 Li (where R is an low-molecularweight alkyl group) [48,49], which is important for confining the loss of lithium inventory to the first few cycles and minimizing irreversible capacity loss. Insolubility of decomposed SEI components to an electrolyte is important for high capacity retention because loosing the components may induce new SEI formation where they dissolved out. According to MD simulations from [50]. Inorganic products are hard to dissolve but can also diffuse into an electrolyte when surrounded by soluble organic products. Li 2 CO 3 is generally abundant on a graphite anode than LiO 2 because of low concentration of lithium on surface of the graphite anode [51].

The layer near the interface of the electrolyte is assumed to be porous and less dense, composed of a large portion of organic components, and filled with electrolyte. This outer, organic layer may undergo further reduction, so its morphology may change in subsequent cycling. The inner layer adjacent to the graphite is presumed to consist mostly of inorganic compounds that protect the anode surface and prevent reduction. Thus, it is assumed to have a denser morphology with lower porosity. In recent studies, the SEI structure shows a bilayer structure in general, but in reality is more complicated [51e54]. For example, according to the results of Takenaka's hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/molecular dynamics (MD) reaction simulation, inorganic salts such as Li 2 CO 3 are abundant near the anode surface and distributed within the whole SEI film, becoming Li 2 CO 3 junctions for the organic lithium carbonates and stabilizing the SEI film [54]. Other recent computational studies have also shown detailed and complicated structures, even though they were based on many simplifying assumptions. Considering real-world LIB systems involving side reactions, impurities, and uneven current distribution, it is likely that SEI structures are even more complicated than those depicted by fundamental simulations.From a historical standpoint, the SEI has been thought of as having a bilayer type structure.

        <p>Recently Lu et al. studied the morphological evolution of the SEI during the formation process [55,56]. Fig. 2 shows SEM micrographs at two different magnifications of the graphite anode surface from their study at different degrees of polarization during the first charge. The SEI thickness increased as the formation cycle proceeded (i.e. as the potential of the anode moved towards the intercalation potential). According to their model, the SEI at the beginning of the formation process contained mainly loosely held organic polymer compounds. As the potential was lowered, the SEI layer transformed into a more compact structure of inorganic salts. Figs. 2 and 3 captures this morphological evolution [55,57].Recently Lu et al. studied the morphological evolution of the SEI during the formation process [55,56].

        <p>The SEI layer formed at the graphite basal plane differs in morphology and chemical composition from that formed at the edge plane. The SEI formed at the basal plane does not need to have ionic conductivity, but it does need to be electronically insulating and impermeable to other electrolyte components. Since lithium ions cannot intercalate into graphene layers across the basal planes, these planes are ionic insulators and do not contribute to reversible capacity. Hence, SEI formation at these locations should be minimized to avoid unnecessary loss of lithium inventory. Due to the different behavior of the SEI layer formed at basal and edge planes, the true SEI formation potentials are not captured by conventional electrochemical measurements.The SEI layer formed at the graphite basal plane differs in morphology and chemical composition from that formed at the edge plane.

        <p>The chemical composition and morphology of the SEI are affected not only by the electrolyte, but also by the chemical compositions and morphologies of carbon/graphite surfaces. In the case of the 1 M LiPF 6 in EC:DMC electrolyte and highly ordered graphite, the SEI at the edge plane is thought to be several times thicker (several nm) than that at basal plane. A thicker layer on the edge plane is consistent with the observation of higher reaction current at the edge plane than the basal plane [58]. On the edge sites for this particular case, the SEI is mainly composed of loosely packed inorganic lithium carbonates, organic lithium alkali carbonates and polymeric compounds on the electrolyte side. On the graphite side of the edge sites, the SEI is mainly composed of densely packed LiF, Li 2 O, and Li 2 CO 3 . In between these two phases, there is an intermixed zone forming a trilayer structure. Overall, LiF and Li 2 CO 3 make up more than half of the SEI layer [59,60]. On the basal sites, the SEI is composed of lithium carbonates more than LiF on the electrolyte side.The chemical composition and morphology of the SEI are affected not only by the electrolyte, but also by the chemical compositions and morphologies of carbon/graphite surfaces.

        <p>On the graphite side of the basal sites, the SEI is composed of similar portions of Li 2 O, LiF, and lithium carbonates with small portions of polymeric compounds. LiF in the SEI is typically found in fluorine system electrolytes such as LiAsF 6 , LiPF 6 , and LiBF 4 . Depending on LIB operating, anode sampling, and analysis conditions, the compositions of the SEI may vary even with the same electrolytes and electrodes used in a cell. LiPF 6 salts are unstable in elevated temperature and may precipitate into LiF during storage or operation. Lithium carbonates can be also decompose and form LiF after reacting with HF. Hence, LiF may be found in the SEI more frequently when there are other reactions before or during the surface analysis. HF formation, particularly observed in the case of LiPF 6 based electrolytes, is considered to dramatically affect the performance of LIBs by attacking the SEI layer. HF production during the SEI formation process is due to the reaction between decomposition products of the LiPF 6 salt and traces of water in the liquid electrolyte phase and/or adsorbed on the graphite surfaces. In recent studies, the amount of LiF found in the SEI still varies considerably from one study to the next. In particular, computational simulations rarely show LiF formation because they generally do not consider impurities like water causing HF production or selfdecomposition from a salt, a poor assumption.On the graphite side of the basal sites, the SEI is composed of similar portions of Li 2 O, LiF, and lithium carbonates with small portions of polymeric compounds.

        <p>For the case of soft carbon in the same electrolyte, polymer and solvent reduction products are more prevalent than salt reduction products [61]. For other salts such as LiBF 4 , LiTFSI, or LiBETI, the percentage of LiF is small and other carbonated species comprise most of the SEI layer [62]. In general, SEI layers are composed of densely packed inorganic compounds such as Li 2 O, Li 2 CO 3 and LiF on the graphite side and loosely packed inorganic and organic species like Li 2 CO 3 , lithium alkyl carbonate (ROCO 2 Li) and polymer on the electrolyte side [63]. There are also other studies that argue large portions of inorganic Li compounds such as LiF are also found on electrolyte side [64e66]. These components, formed by solvent, lithium salt, and electrolyte additive decomposition, are neither uniformly distributed nor well-ordered within the SEI layer. These semi-quantitative concepts about SEI compositions are much less debated than those hypotheses with respect to exact composition, morphology, structure, and formation. The reasons for the uncertainty and inconsistency among different studies arise from analysis difficulty, different electrolyte compositions, different types of carbon/graphite, various SEI formation processes, and other physical and environmental conditions (i.e. temperature).

        <p>There are various reduction processes that compete with each other on the carbon/graphite surface during charging. The reactants are solvents, salts, additives, and trace air impurities (such as water). Electrochemical reaction rates differ depending on their intrinsic properties such as reductive potential, reduction activation energy, and exchange current density. They also depend on reaction sites (basal or edge), pre-decomposed precipitate sites, and many other different anode surface conditions [58,93e96].There are various reduction processes that compete with each other on the carbon/graphite surface during charging.

        <p>Temperature, concentration of electrolyte salt, and reduction current rate significantly affect SEI formation as well [97]. When all of these variable conditions are mixed, it is difficult to analyze the SEI formation mechanism. However, it is generally accepted that LiPF 6 precipitates in the form of LiF or Li x PF y after reduction. Carbonates from the electrolyte solvent precipitate with lithium ions in form of Li 2 CO 3 , lithium alkyl carbonate (ROCO 2 Li), or other organic compounds. While LiF, Li 2 O, Li 2 CO 3 and other insoluble products remain on the graphite surfaces as components of SEI layers, some soluble products from solvent decomposition may diffuse back into the electrolyte. Most reduction processes take place between 0.8 V and 0.2 V vs Li/Li þ on highly ordered graphite. When the SEI is not fully developed, reduction continues below 0.2 V while lithium ions and solvent co-intercalate into the graphene planes. If this co-intercalation is excessive, the SEI layer may not fully develop because of continuous exfoliation.

        <p>In general it has been accepted that the SEI formation is a twostep process. During the first step when the graphite electrode is polarized, the components in the organic electrolyte undergo reductive decomposition to form new chemical species. In the second step, these decomposition products undergo a precipitation process and begin forming the SEI layer until all the sites on the graphite surface are covered. Even though several studies have been conducted to understand the formation mechanism of the SEI, it has been a major topic of debate, which centers on the reduction pathways, especially of the solvent molecules.

        <p>These possible pathways are based on electron transfer to salts/ solvents in electrolyte solutions caused by the cathodic polarization of the electrode, thermodynamic simulations using molecular orbital calculations, and ionic sizes. Among these possibilities, reaction (i) is the desired reaction and leads to the faradaic current within the cell. This reaction occurs at a potential more negative than the potential of the other reactions, so during cathodic polarization, other reactions are preferred until the potential drops close to the intercalation potential. Reactions (ii) and (iii), which address the reduction of the solvent molecules, are the major source of debate in the literature. According to Dahn and Aurbach, the reduction of a solvent molecule (for example [EC]-) is a oneelectron reaction occurring at the surface of the graphite. Therefore, according to this hypothesis, reaction (ii) proceeds with the solvent molecule being reduced to form an intermediate radical anion. This radical anion undergoes further decomposition according to one of the pathways shown at Path 1 or 2 in Fig. 6, and finally solid lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LiEDC) precipitates as shown below the Path 2. Aurbach [49,79] also argued that LiEDC is extremely reactive with traces of water in the electrolyte and forms Li 2 CO 3 upon reacting.These possible pathways are based on electron transfer to salts/ solvents in electrolyte solutions caused by the cathodic polarization of the electrode, thermodynamic simulations using molecular orbital calculations, and ionic sizes.

For example, ROCO 2 Li and ROLi react with CO 2 to form Li 2 CO 3 [105]. The lithium in the SEI will also react spontaneously with atmospheric oxygen to form various lithium oxides (Li 2 O, Li 2 O 2 and LiO 2 ) [36]. These oxides are strong nucleophiles and react further with organic solvents and semicarbonates to form carbonates and alkoxides [106].

        <p>Carbons are widely used as LIB anodes because of their stability and low working potential. Graphite is a crystallite and the most stable allotrope of carbon. It has perfect stacking of graphene layers in AB form and in some cases ABC form. In general, aggregates of perfectly stacked graphite crystallites exist with different orientations in an electrode. Graphite has a redox potential very close to Li/ Li þ , is safe, is the most stable form of carbon, is environmentally benign, and has low (pre-processed) cost. A lithium atom is intercalated between the graphite layers to form an intercalation compound (i.e. LiC 6 ) during LIB operation [19,20]. The intercalation reaction prevents the deposition of metallic lithium on the graphite surface and avoids dendritic growth making these types of LIBs safe. The lithium-ion charge is also maintained, essentially eliminating the activation energy associated with the formation of a chemical bond. The carbon is reduced to maintain charge balance. Fig. 7 shows an aggregate graphite particle and the graphite layers within that particle. In a crystallite of graphite, the two characteristic surfaces are referred to as basal and edge planes. The surfaces parallel to the graphene layers are called basal planes, and the surfaces normal to the graphene layers are edge planes. Lithium predominantly intercalates into the graphene layers through the edge planes in the direction parallel to the basal plane. The SEI formation process also differs at these two planes. Thus the ratio of basal plane to edge planes determines electrochemical performance of graphite electrodes. Different types of graphite such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and natural graphite have been used as anodes. Since the basal plane to edge plane ratios will differ in different forms of graphite, the SEI formation process will be different, as well as the chemical and physical properties of the SEI layer. In turn, these property differences will affect electrode performance during early life and the shape of the long-term capacity fade curve.Carbons are widely used as LIB anodes because of their stability and low working potential.

Lithium predominantly intercalates into the graphene layers through the edge planes in the direction parallel to the basal plane. The SEI formation process also differs at these two planes. Thus the ratio of basal plane to edge planes determines electrochemical performance of graphite electrodes. Different types of graphite such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and natural graphite have been used as anodes. Since the basal plane to edge plane ratios will differ in different forms of graphite, the SEI formation process will be different, as well as the chemical and physical properties of the SEI layer. In turn, these property differences will affect electrode performance during early life and the shape of the long-term capacity fade curve.</p>
        <p>The SEI layer forms differently depending on composition and structure of carbon/graphite surface. The key factors for SEI formation are particle size, basal-to-edge-plane ratio, pore size, degree of crystallinity, and surface chemical composition (adsorbed species) [132,133]. The surface area of small particles is greater than that of large ones for the same weight. Smaller particle size generally causes more edge sites, as well as more SEI formation surface area. The decomposition on basal planes and edges differs because edge sites provide better reactivity than basal ones. Hence, electrolyte decomposition occurs at edge sites first. The edge sites are also the access points for lithium intercalation to graphene layers. Lithium ions diffuse along with solvent molecules and salts. At a potential lower than 0.2 V vs. Li/Li þ , lithium intercalation into the graphene layers via edge sites begins. This intercalation generates concentration differences inducing solvent and salt reactants to move towards the edge sites and decompose there if the edge sites are not fully occupied by the SEI layer. This process also results in a thicker SEI on edge sites than on basal planes.The SEI layer forms differently depending on composition and structure of carbon/graphite surface.

        <p>Few studies have been reported on the effect of the graphite particle size distribution, porosity, surface roughness, surface chemistry and crystallinity [120,132,134e137]. Graphite with low specific surface area tends to exfoliate more. As the surface area is decreased by heat treatment, the number of surface defects increases and the exfoliation tendency of the graphite further increases. Above a critical specific surface area of 0.2 m 2 /g, the exfoliation tendency is suppressed in the absence of surface defects [120]. Graphite particle sizes with surface areas of 1e5 m 2 /g may mitigate exfoliation without introducing excessive irreversible capacity loss. The degree of graphite crystallinity is also an important factor in SEI formation, and highly ordered graphite is preferred for high-energy LIB anodes. When the particle size is small, irreversible capacity loss increases due to larger surface area for lithium inventory loss during SEI formation (a side benefit, though, is that the power density increases with smaller anode particle size). Increasing graphite size is one way for lower irreversible capacity loss and higher energy density, but large particle sizes increase the probability of exfoliation.Few studies have been reported on the effect of the graphite particle size distribution, porosity, surface roughness, surface chemistry and crystallinity [120,132,134e137].

        <p>Chemical composition on carbon/graphite surfaces may also affect the exchange current density and potential for SEI formation, as well as wettability of electrolyte, chemical adhesion between carbon and the SEI layer after decomposition, and between carbon and electrolyte before decomposition [64,93,138e144]. The presence of oxygen species on graphite surfaces increases the reduction potential vs Li/Li þ and helps early SEI formation before lithium intercalation. The presence of these species has been shown to be vital in SEI formation by serving as nucleation sites for electrolyte decomposition, and a lack of them can hinder the decomposition reactions and increase the exfoliation of the graphene layers [145].Chemical composition on carbon/graphite surfaces may also affect the exchange current density and potential for SEI formation, as well as wettability of electrolyte, chemical adhesion between carbon and the SEI layer after decomposition, and between carbon and electrolyte before decomposition [64,93,138e144].

        <p>Oxygen species on graphite surfaces can be attached by heat treatment in various environments. Natural graphite usually has oxygen-containing species on its surface, although the degree of crystallinity may not be that high. To increase it, calcination in air produces more crystallites and increases the adsorbed oxygencontaining species.Oxygen species on graphite surfaces can be attached by heat treatment in various environments.

        <p>LIB liquid electrolytes are commonly composed of a combination of low-molecular-weight organic solvents like ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), or propylene carbonate (PC) and lithium salts like LiPF 6 or LiBF 4 . Because of the high oxidation potential (4.7 V vs. Li/Li þ ) of these organic carbonates, SEI formation is prevented on the cathode surface during charging. PC had historically been a widely used solvent because it is a liquid at cell operating temperatures and has a high dielectric constant (ε ¼ 64) [146]. The dielectric constant is an important indicator that predicts degree of salt dissolution. The drawback of using PC is severe solvent co-intercalation with lithium ions into graphite that exfoliates the graphene sheets, forming decomposition products within the sheets and releasing gases like propylene. Instead, EC is widely used because of its high dielectric constant (ε ¼ 89) and stable SEI formation, although its high viscosity and melting point of 36 C require thinning solvents such as DMC, DEC, and EMC. For example, 1e1.2 M LiPF 6 in 1:1 wt ratio of EC/DEC is a common electrolyte composition. In mixtures of EC/DEC or EC/DMC, LiPF 6 dissolves well and yields ionic conductivities of up to ~10 À2 S/cm À1 , a high reduction potential of 1.3 V vs Li/Li þ , and an oxidation potential of above 4.5 V vs Li/Li þ . This combination results in excellent electrolyte properties, but it is highly flammable.LIB liquid electrolytes are commonly composed of a combination of low-molecular-weight organic solvents like ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), or propylene carbonate (PC) and lithium salts like LiPF 6 or LiBF 4 .

        <p>LiClO 4 has high ionic conductivity (5.6 mS/cm in PC, 8.4 mS/cm in EC/DMC) and may form less resistive SEI layers than LiPF 6 and LiBF 4 due to no LiF decomposition. The drawback is thermal instability that the salt reacts with solvents at elevated temperature and it is explosive. LiBF 4 shows better thermal stability and less sensitivity to moisture than LiPF 6 . But it was not commonly adopted in industry because of low ion conductivity (3.4 mS/cm in PC, 4.9 mS/cm in EC/DMC): about 40% lower than LiPF 6 (5.8 mS/cm in PC, 10.7 mS/cm in EC/DMC) and high resistance of SEI from LiBF 4 electrolyte [147]. Lithium Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide(Li Imide) is highly ion-conductive (5.1 mS/cm in PC, 9.0 mS/cm in EC/ DMC) and thermally stable: no decomposition until 360 C. But it has a serious Al corrosion issue. LiAsF 6 is not adopted in industries because of concerns about the toxicity of As(V) although it has high ion conductivity. LiPF 6 is a well-known salt that is currently used in industries. It may not be the best in all requirements for an electrolyte but well balanced. In terms of safety, an inorganic electrolyte of LiBF 4 in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI-BF 4 ) is one alternative due to its higher boiling point than LiPF 6 in EC/DEC and non-flammability. EMI-BF 4 also has a higher oxidation potential, but its ionic conductivity is lower due to the high solvent viscosity. Lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) also has less thermal reactivity. It is used as a salt by itself or an additive in an electrolyte. LiBOB stabilizes the graphite structure effectively even in pure propylene carbonate (PC) and facilitates SEI formation on the surface of electrode materials. On the other hand, its solubility and conductivity in other common solvents such as EC and PC are inferior. However, these limitations are improved by using a more appropriate solvent such as dimethyl sulfite (DMS) with gbutyrolactone (gBL) [148,149].LiClO 4 has high ionic conductivity (5.6 mS/cm in PC, 8.4 mS/cm in EC/DMC) and may form less resistive SEI layers than LiPF 6 and LiBF 4 due to no LiF decomposition.

        <p>In order to enhance early and stable SEI formation on the graphite anode surface and to prevent exfoliation during the lithium intercalation, liquid additives are often used in organic electrolytes. The most commonly used additive is vinylene carbonate (VC), and it has lower reductive activation energy (13 kcal/ mol) and higher reduction potential (1.05e1.4 V Li/Li þ ) than EC (24.9 kcal/mol and 0.65e0.9 V Li/Li þ , respectively) and PC (26.4 kcal/mol and 0.5e0.75 V Li/Li þ ) [36,150,151]. VC added to PC promotes reductive decomposition at potentials around 1.3 V. About 3 wt% of VC is usually incorporated and improves cycle life and Coulombic efficiency by creating a more stable SEI layer. During the first charging step, VC in EC or PC increases the reduction potential by around 0.2 V, so the solvent mixture decomposes earlier in the formation process than without VC, which starts building an enhanced SEI layer before lithium intercalation begins. When VC is used in EC, it is possible to have large portions of polymer species in SEI [152].In order to enhance early and stable SEI formation on the graphite anode surface and to prevent exfoliation during the lithium intercalation, liquid additives are often used in organic electrolytes.

        <p>Tasaki et al. investigated the reduction activation energy of various additives in the presence of a lithium anode [150]. This study showed that reduction activation energy (energy difference between the reactant and its transition state) of VC is 13 kcal/mol, which is lower than that of EC (24.9 kcal/mol) and PC (26.4 kcal/ mol) and indicates the tendency of VC to reduce easier than EC or PC. Regarding reduction potential, Yoon et al. [153] reported reduction potentials of various additives including VC and Nsubstituted caprolactam (CL) derivatives. The reductions of CL, VC, and EC take place at 1.10 V, 1.05 V, and 0.65 V vs. Li/Li þ , respectively. Jung et al. [154] also obtained similar results via DFT calculations and experiment and showed that EC (0.6 V vs. Li/Li þ , À55.9 kJ/mol Gibbs free energy of reduction) has lower reduction potential than VC (0.75 V vs. Li/Li þ , À160.0 kJ/mol Gibbs free energy of reduction), which agrees with the calculations of Tasaki et al. On the other hand, Wang et al. [155,156] found different results from a polarized continuum model in calculating reduction activation energy of (EC) n Li þ (VC), n ¼ 1e3. Ring-opening barriers of EC (8.8e11.1 kcal/ mol) were found to be lower than that of VC (20.1e21.1 kcal/mol) for reduction reactions, and a major conclusion was that EC decomposes more readily than VC because VC acts as a stable anion intermediate and assists nearby EC reduction. Although the calculations from Wang et al. [156] yielded slightly different results, agreement was found that VC increases solvent reduction reaction rates. Considering reduction potential, reaction enthalpy and activation energy, VC is reduced before EC and PC do during a reduction cycle (charge) although the reduction products of VC may not be as stable as those of EC and PC [153]. In industry, many different proprietary additives are used in even more combinations together with variations on the formation protocol, and the resulting SEI structures are closely guarded.Tasaki et al. investigated the reduction activation energy of various additives in the presence of a lithium anode [150].

        <p>In 1979, Peled first used the term solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for the LIB anode passivation layer [140], and, in 1990, Dahn et al. discovered the advantage of using EC in the electrolyte for forming the SEI [157]. Before the use of EC was commonplace, PC was the most widely used LIB electrolyte solvent, which was highly compatible with lithium metal anodes. Early LIBs implemented lithium anodes, but dendrite growth was a problem in terms of safety and long-term performance [158e161]. Once the discovery of graphite as a safe, high-performing anode intercalation material was made, its major drawback was also quickly discovered. PC easily co-intercalates with lithium ions and exfoliates the graphene layers during electrolyte decomposition, while also releasing propylene gas. Attention shifted to using amorphous carbons having little crystallinity because they tended to exfoliate much less in PC based electrolyte solutions and showed good reversible capacity. The problem with these materials, though, was high initial capacity loss due to thick SEI layer formation. When Dahn et al. found that EC reduced the first-cycle capacity loss (due to a much thinner SEI layer formation) and increased the stability of the SEI by mitigating exfoliation of graphite, solvent mixtures high in EC concentration were mainly used. As the appreciation of having a stable, durable SEI has grown since the early 1990s, much effort has been dedicated to: 1) improving its formation by using additives that result in better SEI-layer architectures; 2) modifying the anode surface for improving exchange current density and chargeedischarge reaction kinetics; 3) implementing chargeedischarge cycles that enhance layer formation; and 4) developing alternative electrolytes that result in less lithium inventory loss during formation.In 1979, Peled first used the term solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for the LIB anode passivation layer [140], and, in 1990, Dahn et al. discovered the advantage of using EC in the electrolyte for forming the SEI [157].

        <p>Current densities, cut-off voltages, and temperatures used during formation cycling have all been shown to have a profound effect on the chemical and microstructural properties of the SEI layer. It starts to form around 0.8 V vs Li/Li þ , and the thickness gradually increases until around 0.3 V vs Li/Li þ . At higher charging anode potentials vs Li/Li þ , the SEI is composed of loosely aggregated organic components with lower ionic conductivity. As the anode potential drops, the SEI becomes more compact and begins to contain inorganic components with higher conductivity. The kinetics of the different SEI forming reactions can be exploited by varying the current densities and temperature. At higher current densities, the formed SEI has a more porous nature with high electronic and ionic conductivity. At lower current densities, the formed SEI is denser with lower electronic conductivity and higher ionic conductivity, which is the main reason formation protocols have historically required extremely low first-charge (and even low second and third charge) rates [121,162,163]. Elevated temperature also enables formation of a stable SEI.Current densities, cut-off voltages, and temperatures used during formation cycling have all been shown to have a profound effect on the chemical and microstructural properties of the SEI layer.

        <p>Few studies have been reported on electrolyte wetting of electrodes, although it is an important factor for reducing SEI formation time and manufacturing resources that directly affect LIB pack cost. In fact, wetting takes the majority of cell production time and involves many of the latter manufacturing steps such as addition of insulators, seals, and safety devices [7]. It takes many hours for electrolyte to completely wet the separator and reach the smallest pores of the electrodes [15], and studying wetting transport phenomena without a complete cell assembly facility is difficult.Few studies have been reported on electrolyte wetting of electrodes, although it is an important factor for reducing SEI formation time and manufacturing resources that directly affect LIB pack cost.

        <p>Wetting electrodes (at low vacuum pressures during electrolyte filling and subsequently at elevated temperature after cell sealing) with electrolyte and forming SEI layers requires ~0.5e2 weeks for the entire process [7,15]. Wood et al. reported costs for a general wetting and formation process, which showed the SEI formation can contribute up to $32e33/kWh of usable energy for the battery pack cost (out of a total cost of ~$500/kWh) [15]. Anode and cathode electrodes need to be fully wetted with electrolyte during the initial portion of formation cycling, which is the process of the first 1e2 successive, slow and shallow chargeedischarge cycles of a cell's life where the anode SEI layer is first formed. The initial wetting process is slow because the electrolyte has to permeate into all pores of the separator and electrodes in a near fully assembled cell. Evacuating gases out of the pores under high vacuum during cell assembly can accelerate infusion of the electrolyte and enable uniform distribution, although it requires more equipment and processing expense. Even under an evacuated condition, the smallest pores of the electrodes and separator may not fully wet unless they have a higher surface energy than the electrolyte. This situation is due to the competition between hydrodynamic forces at low pressure and non-wetting surface forces (the smaller the pore size, the lower the vacuum pressure needed to make a non-wetting liquid enter a pore). To avoid costly and time-consuming vacuum pumping, both electrodes (and the separator) should have high wettability of the electrolyte for full active material utilization during the formation cycling process. The formation process cannot commence until full wetting of all component porous volume is achieved. Wettability of the electrolyte into the electrode pores can be enhanced by lowering surface tension of electrolyte with an additive(s) or by increasing the composite surface energy of the electrode. Stable SEI formation also requires proper chargeedischarge protocols that involve significant time due to slow charge rates between C/5 and C/20 [15]. Simply increasing charge rates for fast SEI formation results in incomplete, non-uniform, electrochemically unstable layers or deposits [121,171e173], thereby lowering cell efficiency, durability and safety. Similarly, insufficient electrolyte wetting leads to a low-quality SEI layer, inactive surface area, and/or premature cell performance degradation.Wetting electrodes (at low vacuum pressures during electrolyte filling and subsequently at elevated temperature after cell sealing) with electrolyte and forming SEI layers requires ~0.5e2 weeks for the entire process [7,15].

        <p>The reduction processes for EC and PC on a charging graphite anode are very similar, yielding similar SEI chemical compositions, but the layers behave differently during subsequent chargeedischarge cycles (i.e. irreversible capacity loss and capacity fade) due to different bulk properties (i.e. thickness, porosity, tortuosity, etc.) of the reduction species [140,174,175].The reduction processes for EC and PC on a charging graphite anode are very similar, yielding similar SEI chemical compositions, but the layers behave differently during subsequent chargeedischarge cycles (i.e. irreversible capacity loss and capacity fade) due to different bulk properties (i.e. thickness, porosity, tortuosity, etc.) of the reduction species [140,174,175].</p>
        <p>An electrolyte system with LiPF 6 dissolved in an EC:DMC mixture is mostly stable above 1 V vs. Li/Li þ [55, 65,154], and no significant decomposition occurs. At potentials below 1 V vs. Li/Li þ , minor decomposition of the electrolyte species may occur, depending on the surface chemistry and morphology of graphite and the nature of electrolyte additives. Temperature and charge rate below this potential threshold also affect the decomposition reaction rates and products [113,114,125]. Disordered carbonaceous structures have a broader range of decomposition potentials than highly oriented ones because of differing reaction site energetics [64]. Graphite surface coatings or modifications can also alter the decomposition potential range. In some cases, minor amounts of highly resistive LiF precipitates can form in the SEI above 1 V vs. Li/ Li þ due to the stability of PF 5 in a compact polar solvent such as EC [92]. This LiF is sometimes detected during the early stages of electrolyte decomposition in nanometer-sized crystallites [55]. PF 5 is known as a strong Lewis acid that can also react with traces of water to produce HF, eliminate alkyl carbonate from lithium alkyl carbonate, and react with solvent carbonyl groups to produce insoluble ether-containing species [17,92,145]. At higher anode potentials, decomposition products like LiF are usually generated on graphite edge plane sites, which are preferable for nucleation due to a lower energy requirement than on basal plane sites. Fortunately LiF generation is kinetically slow and the amount of decomposition is small above 1 V vs. Li/Li þ .An electrolyte system with LiPF 6 dissolved in an EC:DMC mixture is mostly stable above 1 V vs. Li/Li þ [55, 65,154], and no significant decomposition occurs.

        <p>It is well accepted that most of the SEI layer formation takes place within the potential range of 0.2e1.0 V vs. Li/Li þ . However, the formation mechanism(s) is highly debated. There have been two different concepts on the SEI formation process hypothesized, although their final structures are mostly alike. One concept follows a one-electron transfer to the electrolyte at high potential and a multi-electron transfer at low potential [55,145]. In other words, "bulk" lithium compounds (precipitates) are first partially reduced at high potential by a one-electron process due to insufficient electrons with low electron transfer resistance from electrode to electrolyte for complete reduction. At low potential, "compact" lithium compounds are generated from further reduction of preexisting bulk lithium-containing precipitates on the anode surface, or directly by complete reduction of lithium compounds in electrolyte driven by high energy at low potential. The second concept supposes little or no precipitates preoccupying the anode graphite surface at high potential. Hence, electrons can transfer to electrolyte constituents without interference from resistive interfacial compounds. This high electron transfer rate induces compact lithium compound formation at higher potentials, and, as the potential is lowered and the decomposition layer thickens, electrolyte solvent molecules are gradually reduced. Subsequently, partially reduced bulk lithium compounds precipitate on top of the resistive compact layer to a greater extent as the potential reaches ~0.2 V vs. Li/Li þ .It is well accepted that most of the SEI layer formation takes place within the potential range of 0.2e1.0 V vs. Li/Li þ .

        <p>Proponents of both hypotheses agree that major SEI formation begins around 0.8 V vs. Li/Li þ , but it can be higher for certain highly porous carbonaceous active materials [131]. In an ideal situation, the SEI formation will occur prior to lithium intercalation, which prevents co-intercalation of electrolyte constituents. For highly oriented graphite, lithium intercalation occurs at 0.2 V vs. Li/Li þ or less, but it can start at slightly higher potentials in disordered or porous carbons [64,116,131]. Within the potential range of 0.6e0.8 V vs. Li/Li þ , electrons at the graphite surface transfer to the liquid electrolyte containing solvated lithium ions. These cations diffuse towards the graphite particles with an average of four strongly coordinated solvent molecules and an uncoordinated PF 6 À anion [118]. Uncoordinated solvent molecules are less likely to accept an electron because they are more stable than those associated with lithium ions. Most decomposition products from electro-reduction precipitate on the anode surfaces, while minor amounts diffuse back into the liquid phase and eventually reprecipitate elsewhere. Decomposition reactions prefer graphite edges because these sites usually include defects that are unstable and tend to be highly reactive. As the reaction rate on edge sites slows due to an increase in the coverage of precipitates, decomposition takes place on basal planes as well. These electrolyte decomposition reactions are irreversible and result in loss of lithium ions (cathode lithium inventory), solvent molecules, and salt anions (see Table 2 and Figs. 8e11) [145].Proponents of both hypotheses agree that major SEI formation begins around 0.8 V vs. Li/Li þ , but it can be higher for certain highly porous carbonaceous active materials [131].

        <p>Below 0.6 V vs. Li/Li þ , a much greater extent of electrolyte decomposition takes place [55]. Dense inorganic lithium compound formation (i.e. LiO 2 , Li 2 CO 3 and LiF) is highly favorable at edge sites because of low electronic resistance to reducing solventcoordinated lithium ions. Some less dense inorganic species such as lithium alkali carbonates and other organic species generally decompose on basal planes where reactions are less favorable. Since electronic resistance increases when a dense inorganic film is present on the graphite surfaces, subsequent decomposition onto the inorganic compounds will involve only partial reduction resulting in precipitation of loosely aggregated compounds such as lithium alkyl carbonates, or polymers. A portion of the lithium alkyl carbonate can be further reduced to form LiO 2 or Li 2 CO 3 and release ethylene (from EC), propylene (from PC), or CO 2 gases [131]. The release of these gases may cause cracks in the existing SEI layer or even expose new anode graphite surface to electrolyte for further SEI decomposition reactions (further consuming lithium inventory).Below 0.6 V vs. Li/Li þ , a much greater extent of electrolyte decomposition takes place [55].

        <p>Reducing LIB formation protocol time is necessary to lower production cost of cells (and ultimately packs) and manufacturing capital costs. The process currently lasts from about 4e5 days up to ~2 weeks depending on the cell chemistry, and it consumes a great deal of process energy (low-grade heat and electricity). In addition, it is also a substantial process bottleneck unless an inordinate amount of formation cyclers are used. SEI formation time can be reduced four ways: 1) by mixing additives into the electrolyte to form the SEI compounds more quickly and/or alter the overall composition of the SEI layer; 2) by modifying the anode graphite surface chemistry or substitution of the inactive binder and conductive additive materials with those having better wettability; 3) by charging and discharging the cells at higher rates within certain portions of the operating voltage window; and 4) by increasing the cell temperature during wetting and SEI formation.Reducing LIB formation protocol time is necessary to lower production cost of cells (and ultimately packs) and manufacturing capital costs.

        <p>Anode active material surface coatings and chemical modifications can also improve SEI layer properties [144,176]. The volume change of carbonaceous materials during lithium intercalation is much lower when compared to other anode materials such as Al, Si, Sn, and Sb [43]. It has been found that an increase in disordered carbon anode surface oxygen resulted in low graphite exfoliation and stable SEI formation [135,143,177,178]. Using this property, a thin carbon coating on graphite can be implemented for improving capacity retention. Non-graphitic carbons do not undergo exfoliation to a great extent, but their first-cycle irreversible capacity loss is much higher due to greater surface area. When graphite is used without a carbon coating, reversible capacity is lower; however, once coated by a high-surface-area disordered carbon, reversible capacity increases because the majority of the SEI layer forms within the thin coating. This surface modification tends to prevent extensive graphite exfoliation [96,136,179].Anode active material surface coatings and chemical modifications can also improve SEI layer properties [144,176].

        <p>Generally, a high charging rate during the first cycle results in a porous and highly resistive SEI layer, while a low charging rate results in the opposite SEI characteristics. It has been found that for a 0.5C charging rate during SEI formation, capacity retention at room temperature operation was negatively affected [113]. Also, when the cell temperature was held above 40 C, capacity retention was even more negatively affected for a 0.5C SEI formation charging rate [114]. Hence, a first charging rate between 0.05C and 0.2C is preferred for stable SEI formation. In some cases, though, high charging rate can be beneficial to SEI formation. For example, when TIMREX ® SFG44 graphite was heat-treated in an inert gas at 3000 C, a high charge current of 320 mA/g (~1C), showed better reversible capacity in 1 M LiPF 6 EC/DMC than a much lower charge current of 10 mA/g (~0.03C) [122]. In this case, high current decomposed the electrolyte faster than solvents could intercalate into graphene sheets and cause exfoliation. Low charging rates may be beneficial for SEI formation, but they slow cell production rates and increase production cost and plant capital expense. Building a stable SEI with a charging rate greater than 0.5C may require a great deal of further effort on developing proper additives, optimizing cell temperature, and modifying the anode surface chemistry. At higher temperatures, SEI formation may also be accelerated. SEI layers formed at temperatures around 40 C tend to have more compact lithium precipitates, such as Li 2 CO 3 and Li 2 O, rather than softer, organic precipitates like ROCO 2 Li. However, high temperature may induce LiF precipitation from fluorine containing salts. Molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulation methods have been used to understand the intricate relationship between the SEI layer and electrolyte. The MD approach uses atomic force calculations through solving Newton's equations of motion and investigates dynamic movements and equilibrium of atoms and molecules primarily with potentials from semi-empirical relationships. While MD has provided detailed information on classical many-body problems, ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) has extended MD capability by combining the Density functional theory (DFT) is more rigorous than MD, and the former is another computational approach in quantum mechanics that solves Schr€ odinger equation. It estimates the electronic structures in atomic and molecular systems, but it is limited to smaller simulation sizes than MD because of the associated computational intensity. One of the issues in using DFT is weak vander-Waals-like forces of graphene layers, which can affect calculations for lithium-ion/solvent-molecule co-intercalation into graphite. Computed graphene interlayer binding energy significantly varies depending on DFT functionals [192]. Local-density approximation (LDA), a well-known and simple functional, underestimates the binding energy of graphite interlayer as shown in Fig. 12. The binding energies from experiments were 31e52 meV/ atom [193e195]. Another issue in using quantum simulations is that the simulations are typically not suitable for estimating competing reactions.Generally, a high charging rate during the first cycle results in a porous and highly resistive SEI layer, while a low charging rate results in the opposite SEI characteristics.

        <p>Jorn et al. performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with graphite in LiPF 6 /EC electrolytes, while considering graphite basal and edge planes [196]. In this study, the SEI layer was composed of Li 2 EDC (lithium ethylene dicarbonate) only or Li 2 EDC with different amounts of LiF. They found that edge planes could accommodate more Li ions than basal planes due to the broad range of EC orientations, which might cause different SEI formation processes and structures at the two types of reaction sites. Thicker SEI layers or higher HF contents in the electrolyte resulted in a higher lithium ion concentration in the vicinity of the SEI surface, promoting higher probability of lithium ion transport from solvent to SEI. DFT calculations also showed that irreversible capacity loss (ICL) on graphite surfaces, generally on edges, having dangling bonds is higher than that on graphite surfaces having H-terminated edges [197]. This finding perhaps implies greater SEI formation thickness due to unstable graphite edges. Surface properties of graphite may also affect adhesion of the SEI to the graphite surfaces.

        <p>There have been other computational approaches to understanding SEI formation and lithium-ion/solvent co-intercalation into graphene layers. DFT and MD simulations showed that halfdistances between CeC (graphene) interlayers were 0.59 nm for Li þ (EC)C 72 , 0.69 nm for Li þ (EC) 4 C 72 , 0.70 nm for Li þ (PC)C 72 , and 0.85 nm for Li þ (PC) 4 C 72 when no ring openings of EC or PC were assumed [199]. Half-distances between CeC interlayers were 0.325e0.335 nm with no lithium ions or solvent molecules and 0.356e0.376 nm for LiC 6 [199e202]. If there were ring openings of EC or PC, the difference between the associated EC and PC CeC distances would be little because the PC methyl group would have free rotation after the ring opening. For the case where the PC and EC molecules would not undergo ring opening during cointercalation, Li þ (PC) n and Li þ (EC) n could cause graphite disintegration by widening the CeC layers (which experience only weak van der Waals forces), and since Li þ (PC) n is more massive than Li þ (EC) n , the probability of this disintegration process could be higher for Li þ (PC) n than Li þ (EC) n .There have been other computational approaches to understanding SEI formation and lithium-ion/solvent co-intercalation into graphene layers.

        <p>Regarding the common VC additive, DFT based MD simulations from Ushirogata et al. showed that VC reacted with an EC anion radical causing a one-electron reduction of EC [182], which implies that VC assists the EC reduction process. Although exactly how VC decomposes is not yet clear, experimental and computational agreement has been found that VC increases solvent reduction reaction rates.Regarding the common VC additive, DFT based MD simulations from Ushirogata et al. showed that VC reacted with an EC anion radical causing a one-electron reduction of EC [182], which implies that VC assists the EC reduction process.

        <p>A molecular dynamics study from Kim et al. showed that Li 2 CO 3 and Li 2 O were the main SEI components on anodes when EC and DMC were used as the electrolyte solvents [51]. SEI layers were found to form at about 1 V vs. Li/Li þ , and they were composed primarily of inorganic components close to the anode surface and primarily of organic ones close to the liquid electrolyte. In these simulations, however, lithium metal was considered as the anode instead of graphite. It should also be noted that the presence of electrolyte salts were not considered, and reaction gas products from the inner portion of the SEI were not allowed to diffuse outward into the liquid phase (these gases would be removed under real-world formation conditions). Hence, actual SEI layers are composed of somewhat different compounds than these particular calculated ones.A molecular dynamics study from Kim et al. showed that Li 2 CO 3 and Li 2 O were the main SEI components on anodes when EC and DMC were used as the electrolyte solvents [51].

        <p>Lithium ion transport in Li 2 EDC, a common component of SEI layers, was studied by EIS experiments and MD simulations with APPLE&amp;P force field and G4MP2 and MP2 levels [189]. The conductivity of Li 2 EDC at room temperature was found to be 10 À9 S/cm from EIS analysis and 2 Â 10 À10 e10 À8 S/cm from MD simulation. The calculated activation energy ranged from 64 to 84 kJ/mol at 393 K, indicating that lithium ion transport exhibited a hopping mechanism at high temperature.Lithium ion transport in Li 2 EDC, a common component of SEI layers, was studied by EIS experiments and MD simulations with APPLE&amp;P force field and G4MP2 and MP2 levels [189].

        <p>Metalloid or metal oxides, especially SiO x and SnO x , are regarded as prime candidate materials for high-energy batteries due to high theoretical capacity and earth abundance [209e211], despite Si and Sn having higher operating potentials than graphite (around 0.4 V and 0.6 V vs. Li/Li þ , respectively). One of main problems, however, is that these two materials suffer from extreme volume changes during lithium intercalation and deintercalation, leading to: 1) extensive, unstable, and thick SEI formation; 2) poor longterm mechanical properties; and 3) severe capacity fade.Metalloid or metal oxides, especially SiO x and SnO x , are regarded as prime candidate materials for high-energy batteries due to high theoretical capacity and earth abundance [209e211], despite Si and Sn having higher operating potentials than graphite (around 0.4 V and 0.6 V vs. Li/Li þ , respectively).

        <p>In order to build stable SEI layers on these materials, research has concentrated on a combined materials approach such as Si alloys [52,209,210,212], Sn alloys [213e216], SieC or SneC composites [213,217e230], Sn or Si composited with carbon nanomaterials [231e239], MoeC or NieC [240e244], or mixing with graphene [245e247]. For these solutions, volumetric capacities drop to half of those of pure Si or Sn, but the reductions in capacity still result in anodes with much higher specific capacities than graphite. Volume changes on these composited and blended materials also become smaller, making the formed SEI layers more chemically stable and longer lasting. Coating Al 2 O 3 on these materials also mitigates volume changes [248,249].In order to build stable SEI layers on these materials, research has concentrated on a combined materials approach such as Si alloys [52,209,210,212], Sn alloys [213e216], SieC or SneC composites [213,217e230], Sn or Si composited with carbon nanomaterials [231e239], MoeC or NieC [240e244], or mixing with graphene [245e247].

        <p>Lithium metal is also being reconsidered as a possible anode candidate because it has the highest specific capacity, but it suffers from significant safety concerns related to lithium dendrite growth into and through the separator (electrical shorting). One reason this degradation and potential failure mechanism occurs is because the SEI layer is not uniform and tough enough to prevent dendrite growth. Some of the proposed ways to prevent lithium dendrite growth are hollow carbon nanospheres covering surface of lithium anode, adopting an alternative salt, and electrolyte additives [250e252].Lithium metal is also being reconsidered as a possible anode candidate because it has the highest specific capacity, but it suffers from significant safety concerns related to lithium dendrite growth into and through the separator (electrical shorting).

        <p>Some additives having fluorine can also improve SEI formation on metal anode materials.

        <p>In general, most additive research focuses on forming stable and robust SEI layers. Zhu et al., on the other hand, used polyfluoroalkyl compounds as an additive to build a micelle-like SEI layer on an anode electrode. The heads of the additive decompose on the electrode surfaces and solvophobic tails point outwards towards the electrolyte [258]. They found 4-(perfluorooctyl)-1,3-dioxolan-2-one improved capacity retention and lowered impedance in high voltage lithium ion batteries. These pre-formed SEI layers were found to protect the cathode from electrolyte decomposition as well as the anode. They also tested lithium difluorooxalatoborate, triphenylamine, and 1,4-benzodiozane-6,7-diol as a combined additive and obtained improved capacity retention and lowered impedance for a Li 1.2 Ni 0.15 Mn 0.55 Co 0.1 O 2 (TODA HE5050)/graphite cell [259].In general, most additive research focuses on forming stable and robust SEI layers.

        <p>PC as an electrolyte solvent has excellent properties with the exception of exfoliating the graphite during unstable SEI formation. Wagner et al. improved anode SEI formation by using methyl vinyl sulfone (MVS) and ethyl vinyl sulfone (EVS) additives in PC [260]. These additives decomposed on graphite and built protective SEI layers before PC could intercalate and react because MVS and EVS have 1.3 eV and 1.2 eV lower LUMO energies, respectively, than PC. Unlike these "active" additives that decompose on the anode, there are other additives that prevent decomposition during cycling. For example, Chr etien et al. mixed both LiF and glyme additives (CH 3 O [CH 2 CH 2 O] n CH 3 ) in the electrolyte to inhibit side reactions [261]. Glymes and lithium salt compounds are more electrochemically stable than ethers and have high oxidation potentials close to 4.7 V, allowing high-voltage operation with NMC.PC as an electrolyte solvent has excellent properties with the exception of exfoliating the graphite during unstable SEI formation.

        <p>LIBs for high energy or high power demands like vehicle application require high capacity, high capacity retention, high voltage operation, low cost, low weight and volume, etc. All of these requirements are deeply related to SEI layers. Regarding capacity and capacity retention during the first few charge cycles, batteries lose approximately 10e15% of their capacity due to initial anode SEI formation. Afterword, irreversible capacity loss continues due to gradual SEI deposition during long-term cycling, although it is far less than the loss during initial SEI formation. The capacity loss percentage and initial SEI properties vary depending on formation conditions such as anode material surface area, surface properties of the material, anode-to-cathode capacity ratio, temperature, charge rate, charge depth, surface properties of the anode materials, salt/solvent properties, additives, and impurities. Detailed information about the effects of these properties and conditions can be found in previous sections of this paper.LIBs for high energy or high power demands like vehicle application require high capacity, high capacity retention, high voltage operation, low cost, low weight and volume, etc. All of these requirements are deeply related to SEI layers.

        <p>High-voltage operation of LIBs does not significantly affect anode SEI formation directly, but it does have indirect effects. Cathode materials designed for operation at high cell potential (i.e. overcharged NMC or LMR-NMC) release cathode constituents (mostly Mn, some Ni, and a minor amount of Co) into the electrolyte that diffuse through the separator to the anode side, and in turn, induce more SEI formation by increasing the electron conductivity of SEI layer. High-voltage operation of cells also causes electrolyte instability (oxidation) on the cathode surfaces, and a SEI-like layer forms at the cathode that is chemically less stable than its anode counterpart. Hence, under these cell operating conditions, cell impedance increases due to both changes in the anode SEI layer and excessive growth of the cathode SEI layer.High-voltage operation of LIBs does not significantly affect anode SEI formation directly, but it does have indirect effects.

        <p>This paper comprehensively reviews the science of SEI layer formation on carbon/graphite anode surfaces in the LIBs, including structure, morphology, chemical composition, electrochemistry, formation mechanism, and formation cycling. In order to develop shorter, more robust LIB formation protocols, which are needed to reduce cell manufacturing cost and battery plant capital investment, a thorough understanding of the relationship between stateof-the-art SEI layer compositions and capacity fade are still needed. Furthermore, new formation protocols which develop ideal SEI layers (those that consume minimal lithium inventory during formation and reduce capacity fade during long-term cell operation) in shorter time periods will require an understanding of SEI layer evolution over the LIB life, a subject which is currently not well understood.This paper comprehensively reviews the science of SEI layer formation on carbon/graphite anode surfaces in the LIBs, including structure, morphology, chemical composition, electrochemistry, formation mechanism, and formation cycling.

        <p>It is understood and accepted, however, that the SEI is formed by the decomposition products of the electrolyte solvent molecules and lithium salt, and it critically affects the short-term and longterm performance of the cell. The importance of the SEI layer was given in terms of first-cycle efficiency, capacity retention, and cell cost, as well as the state of understanding of the SEI formation mechanism and methods of analysis and characterization. Various factors that affect SEI formation were also discussed such as anode materials, surface properties, formation current density, electrolyte additives, and cell temperature.It is understood and accepted, however, that the SEI is formed by the decomposition products of the electrolyte solvent molecules and lithium salt, and it critically affects the short-term and longterm performance of the cell.

        <p>The anode SEI layer covers the graphite surfaces and shields lithium ions from the electrolyte solution, which prevents further electrolyte decomposition. This shielding property enables reversible capacity during extended chargeedischarge cycling. However, the SEI formation process consumes lithium ions and electrolyte when generated, resulting in first-cycle irreversible capacity and lithium inventory losses. This irreversible capacity loss may continue if the SEI is not well formed by hindering electrolyte diffusion or allowing unwanted electron transfer from the graphite to the liquid phase.The anode SEI layer covers the graphite surfaces and shields lithium ions from the electrolyte solution, which prevents further electrolyte decomposition.
