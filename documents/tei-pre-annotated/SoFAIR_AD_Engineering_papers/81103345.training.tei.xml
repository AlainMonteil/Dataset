        <p>Two-dimensional meso-scale finite element models with realistic aggregates, cement paste and voids of concrete are developed using microscale X-ray Computed Tomography images. Cohesive elements with traction-separation laws are pre-embedded within cement paste and aggregate-cement interfaces to simulate complex nonlinear fracture. Tension tests using a large number of images were simulated with statistical analysis. The very different load-carrying capacities and crack patterns demonstrate the effects of random distribution of phases.

        <p>Micro/meso-scale modelling of damage and fracture in quasi-brittle multiphase materials, such as concrete, has received more and more attention, in order to obtain a better understanding of their failure mechanisms and to evaluate the uncertainty and reliability arising from a random distribution of phases. There are basically two approaches in characterising random heterogeneity in materials numerically: a direct approach and an indirect approach. In the direct approach, different phases including the matrix, inclusions and interfaces are explicitly modelled by finite elements (FE) each having specific properties. The randomness in the spatial distribution of different phases is realised by the randomised positions and shapes of inclusions [1][2][3][4]. In the indirect approach, the material properties are modelled as spatially-varying random fields, such that different phases are implicitly modelled [5][6][7][8]. However, most of these studies use assumed micro/meso-scale morphologies or assumed random field properties rather than using direct and accurate representations of the internal structures of the materials. Therefore, the simulated micro/meso-scale damage and fracture processes cannot be directly and accurately validated, although macro-scale load-displacement curves can be compared with experimental results.Micro/meso-scale modelling of damage and fracture in quasi-brittle multiphase materials, such as concrete, has received more and more attention, in order to obtain a better understanding of their failure mechanisms and to evaluate the uncertainty and reliability arising from a random distribution of phases.

        <p>More representative geometrical models can be constructed based on 2D images obtained from digital cameras [9] or microscopes [10]. More recently, X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) has become available to acquire 3D images of the microstructure. XCT is routinely used in hospitals, but has now become an attractive tool for characterising the microstructures of materials, because of its high resolution, non-destructive nature, and clear visualisation in 3D. In the last decade, tremendous efforts have been made in applying the XCT to characterise microstructures and to study evolutions of damage and fracture for a variety of materials, including geological materials (rock, soil and fossils) [11], metals and alloys [12][13][14], porous materials [15], composites [16], asphalt mixtures [4,17] and concrete [18,19]. However, 3D XCT images have only occasionally been used to build geometrically realistic numerical models to study the mechanical behaviour of materials, for example, by Hollister et al. [20] for trabecular bones, Terada et al. [21] for metal matrix composites, Ali et al. [22] for carbon/carbon composites, McDonald et al. [23] for foams and Manning et al. for dinosaurs [24]. In most of these studies, simple linear elastic stress analyses were carried out, or an effective stiffness based on homogenisation method was calculated. Recently, very limited simulations based on XCT images were carried out to model the crack opening and fracture process zone in poly-granular graphite [25] and interfacial damage in carbon/carbon composites [26]. Jivkov et al. [27] built a lattice model based on the porosity distribution measured by XCT to simulate brittle damage in concrete. However, the fracture of materials with complex microstructures such as concrete based on realistic microstructures has received little attention.More representative geometrical models can be constructed based on 2D images obtained from digital cameras [9] or microscopes [10].

        <p>In this study, 2D meso-scale FE models are developed for fracture modelling in concrete based on images from an in-situ micro-scale X-ray CT test [28]. In these models, the material heterogeneity is characterised by three phases, namely, aggregates, cement paste and voids. To model complicated fracture processes, zero-thickness cohesive interface elements (CIEs) with normal/shear traction-separation constitutive laws were inserted within cement paste and on aggregate-cement interfaces, using an algorithm extended from a previous one for homogeneous materials [7]. Simulations of uniaxial tension tests were carried out. The effects of mesh types, loading directions, meso-structures, and key fracture parameters on the stressstrain curves and crack patterns were investigated.In this study, 2D meso-scale FE models are developed for fracture modelling in concrete based on images from an in-situ micro-scale X-ray CT test [28].

        <p>Concrete cube specimens of size 40 mm and target cylinder compressive strength 15 MPa were cast in the lab. This target strength and size of specimens were chosen so that the specimens could be loaded to failure using a 25 kN loading rig that could be accommodated in situ within the XCT system. Ordinary Portland cement and gravel aggregates with an average size 5 mm were used. No fine aggregates (i.e. sand) were used to ensure relatively simple internal structures that could be processed and modelled by desktop computers and workstations, although the XCT image-based modelling methodology in this study can be readily extended to realistic concrete with both coarse and fine aggregates if computational power allows. The in-situ experiment was carried out at the Manchester X-ray Imaging Facility, the University of Manchester, UK, using the 225/320 kV Nikon Metris custom bay. The X-ray projections (radiographs) were acquired with an exposure time of 2 s at an accelerating voltage of 160 kV and 60 lA beam current using a tungsten target. For each scan, the stage was rotated through 360°, resulting in 2000 projections collected on a Perkin Elmer 2048 Â 2048 pixel amorphous silicon flat panel detector with an effective pixel size 37.2 lm. A 3D attenuation contrast image was computationally reconstructed using a filtered back projection algorithm from the projections comprising each dataset.

            <rs type="software">VG Studio</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">Avizo</rs> software packages were used to generate, visualise and segment the raw 15 GB 3D datasets. To reduce the data processing time and possible edge effects, a 37.2 mm cube region of interest (ROI) was cropped from the 40 mm cube volume. The 3D data size was reduced to 2 GB for each scan with the resolution also changed from 37.2 lm to 100 lm. The detailed reconstruction and segmentation procedures can be found in [28].

        <p>Fig. 2a shows a representative xy section (cross-section 1). In this segmented image, the pixels of aggregates, cement paste and voids were assigned with unique grey-scale values for each, e.g., 1 for aggregates, 2 for cement paste and 3 for voids. There are 372 pixels in each direction, so each pixel represents 0.1 mm. Further image processing operations were conducted in order to condition the subsequent mesh. Phase regions of one pixel width (examples highlighted by red1 circles in Fig. 2a) would unnecessarily increase the number of total finite elements and could lead to numerical difficulties in the FE analysis [29]. The grey levels of these regions were thus changed to be consistent with the surrounding values.

        <p>A 2D slice comprises an array of square pixels. Fig. 3a shows a small part of cross-section 1 in Fig. 2b. Naturally, each pixel can be modelled by a quadrilateral element in the FE mesh. The resultant mesh is shown in Fig. 3b, in which the boundaries between two phases are zigzagged. This situation is caused by image digitisation and does not well represent the real material interfaces. In addition, the stress concentration at the corner points may lead to numerical difficulties in FE simulations. Therefore, these inter-phase boundaries were further smoothed by dividing the corner elements into two triangles and assigning adjacent phase values (see Fig. 3c). After mesh smoothing, the volume fraction of the voids changes from 0.47% to 0.50% for voids, 50.72% to 51.84% for aggregates, and 48.81% to 47.66% for cement paste. These small changes are acceptable.A 2D slice comprises an array of square pixels. Fig. 3a shows a small part of cross-section 1 in Fig. 2b.

        <p>In order to simulate the fracture process, four-noded cohesive interface elements (CIEs) having zero in-plane thickness are inserted into the generated initial mesh. The detailed CIE insertion procedure devised for homogeneous materials in [7] is extended to account for multiple phases and interfaces. Three sets of CIEs with different traction-separation laws are inserted, namely, CIE_AGG within the aggregate, CIE_CEM within the cement paste, and CIE_INT on the aggregatecement interfaces. As the aggregates have much higher strength than the cement paste and the phase boundaries in normal concrete, here cracks are prevented from initiating inside the aggregates by assuming elastic behaviour without damage to CIE_AGG. However, it is possible to model crack propagation through aggregates (e.g. lightweight concrete) by assigning damage properties to CIE_AGG.In order to simulate the fracture process, four-noded cohesive interface elements (CIEs) having zero in-plane thickness are inserted into the generated initial mesh.

        <p>Following the method introduced in Section 2, 2D meso-scale FE meshes of 373 cross-sections were constructed, including the first one in xy plane (see Fig. 4) and all 372 slices in yz plane. The 2D solid elements (CPS3 and CPS4R) for aggregates and cement paste were assumed to behave linear elastically. The linear tension/shear softening laws were used to model CIEs [7] with quadratic nominal stress initiation criterion and linear damage evolution criterion. For comparison, the same material properties as in [2] were used in this study. They are listed in Table 1. Due to the lack of experimental data, the shear fracture properties were assumed to be the same as the normal ones. Uniaxial tension tests were simulated. By default, the meshes were fixed at the left boundary and were subjected to a uniformly distributed displacement at the right boundary, i.e., a displacement-controlled loading scheme was used. All analyses were ended at a displacement d = 0.2 mm or strain e = 0.0054. The 
            <rs type="software">ABAQUS/Explicit</rs> was used to solve the nonlinear equation systems with a step time of 0.01s, which was found long enough to ensure the quasi-static loading condition.

The stress r is calculated by dividing the total nodal reaction force of all the nodes on the right boundary by the specimen length. It can be seen that the peak loads and the post-peak softening responses are broadly similar for all three curves are close. However, one should not compare the curves in Fig. 5 quantitatively, as they describe specimens of very different sizes and phase proportions.Fig. 5 shows the stress-displacement (r-d) curve for the cross-section 1 under uniaxial tension in the horizontal (X) direction alongside experimental results obtained by [30] and a simulation of a 2D meso-structure [2].

        <p>Fig. 6 illustrates the initiation and propagation of microcracks before peak load (points marked A, B, C and D in Fig. 5), which are represented by the CIEs having a scalar damage variable SDEG greater than 0.9. It should be noted that SDEG = 1.0 means complete failure. A displacement scale factor (DSF) 10 was used in all deformed crack patterns for clarity unless specified otherwise. Fig. 6a shows that a few microcracks initiate on the aggregate-cement interfaces at a low stress r = 2.36 MPa (point A in Fig. 5). As the stress increases, more and more microcracks appear, with most of them roughly perpendicular to the loading direction. Fig. 6b shows a complex microcrack pattern in the nonlinear stage (r = 3.03 MPa at point B). When it approaches the peak (r = 3.34 MPa at point C), the microcrack pattern in Fig. 6c looks similar to that at the peak (r = 3.36 MPa at point D). The simulations in Fig. 6 suggest that a large number of microcracks initiate very quickly at an early stage of loading, and that the microcrack pattern gradually becomes stable in the nonlinear pre-peak stage. It can also be seen that before the peak load is reached, the microcracks are not connected to form any dominant macrocracks. This is because most of them lie on the aggregate-cement interfaces due to the relatively low cohesive strength (3 MPa), and only a small number of them are inside the cement paste due to its higher cohesive strength (6 MPa). The simulation illustrates that the approach of pre-inserting CIEs is very flexible and powerful in modelling complex fracture processes.Fig. 6 illustrates the initiation and propagation of microcracks before peak load (points marked A, B, C and D in Fig. 5), which are represented by the CIEs having a scalar damage variable SDEG greater than 0.9.

        <p>As is evident from Fig 7, the peak load (strength) is followed by macrocrack propagation process (points marked D, E, F and G in Fig. 5). It can be seen that macrocracking is not evident at the peak load (Fig. 7a). As the displacement further increases, some aggregate-cement interfacial cracks continue to propagate and gradually coalesce with newly formed cracks in the cement paste phase (Fig. 7b andc). Ultimately, the specimen fails with two main macrocracks. It should be noted that the microcracks in Fig. 6 still exist, but they are not shown in Fig. 7 because their widths are much smaller than that of the two macrocracks. The maximum crack opening is 0.0042 mm for point D and 0.0778 mm for point G, respectively.As is evident from Fig 7, the peak load (strength) is followed by macrocrack propagation process (points marked D, E, F and G in Fig. 5).

        <p>Fig. 8 shows the chain of crack propagation events for a localised region (the yellow highlighted region in Fig. 7). It is clearly shown that the fracture starts from aggregate-cement interfacial microcracks. When two interfacial cracks occur around adjacent aggregates, a crack inside the cement paste initiates to bridge the interfacial cracks so that a connected crack path is formed. Meanwhile, some cracks nearby become unloaded and close up. This again demonstrates the powerful capability of the pre-inserting CIE method in modelling complex fracture sequences and for elucidating the fundamental mechanisms.Fig. 8 shows the chain of crack propagation events for a localised region (the yellow highlighted region in Fig. 7).

        <p>The FE mesh of cross-section 1 in Fig. 4 mainly consists of quadrilateral elements (CPS4R). Only the inter-phase boundaries are smoothed with right-angled isosceles triangle elements. To investigate the effect of element types,

The predicted r-e curves are shown in Fig. 13 seen that the predicted strengths of the same specimen differ about 11% (3.36 MPa and 3.80 MPa). These differences are caused by different distributions of phases (since the same volume fractions of each phase are maintained) under the same loading direction.

        <p>In order to examine the variation in performance with microstructural heterogeneity, the results for various cross-sections (slice numbers 40, 100 and 240 shown in Fig. 1) are presented here. The stochastic fluctuation in phase volume fractions and the predicted tensile strengths for the different slices are shown in Fig. 14. There is no evident correlation between the volume fractions of cement paste and aggregates and the tensile strength. However, there is a clear trend that higher void volume fractions lead to lower strength, indicating that the internal defects should be minimised for optimal material design.In order to examine the variation in performance with microstructural heterogeneity, the results for various cross-sections (slice numbers 40, 100 and 240 shown in Fig. 1) are presented here.

        <p>The predicted r-e curves are compared in Fig. 15, along with the final crack patterns shown in Figs. 16-18. It can be seen that, in the case of two main macrocracks (Figs. 7d and16), the strength drops slowly and the residual strength is relatively high. On the contrary, the strength drops to near zero much more quickly when only one main macrocrack takes place (Figs. 17 and18). This may be due to the easier forming of a weakest link in the latter case and once formed, the single crack opens much faster, whereas in the two-crack case, the strong aggregates between the two cracks prevent them from bridging or linking into a single crack and thus results in higher residual load-carrying capacity. It is also demonstrated that the stress-strain curves are closely correlated to the mesoscale crack propagation process, which is closely related to the heterogeneous internal meso-structures. The very different load-carrying capacities and crack patterns at different locations in the same specimen reflect the effects of random distribution of phases of random shapes and sizes. This also demonstrates the limitations of 2D meso-scale modelling and the necessity of 3D modelling, as there exists only one crack pattern in the physical test of one specimen. 3.6. Statistical analysis of predicted strengths Fig. 19 shows the predicted r-e curves from 372 images in yz plane and the mean curve. The mean value (l) and standard deviation (SD) of the strengths are 3.39 MPa and 0.32 MPa, respectively. The cross-sections near 240 (Fig. 18) contain large voids which resulted in much lower strengths than the others. The scatter in the predicted strength and the softening tails reflect the very different microstructures.The predicted r-e curves are compared in Fig. 15, along with the final crack patterns shown in Figs. 16-18. It can be seen that, in the case of two main macrocracks (Figs. 7d and16), the strength drops slowly and the residual strength is relatively high. On the contrary, the strength drops to near zero much more quickly when only one main macrocrack takes place (Figs. 17 and18). This may be due to the easier forming of a weakest link in the latter case and once formed, the single crack opens much faster, whereas in the two-crack case, the strong aggregates between the two cracks prevent them from bridging or linking into a single crack and thus results in higher residual load-carrying capacity.

        <p>Fig. 21 shows that statistically there exists an inversely proportionate relation between the predicted strength and the void volume fraction. It can be also noted that 320 (86%) images have a void volume fraction less than 1% with the predicted strength between 3.1 and 3.9 MPa.Fig. 21 shows that statistically there exists an inversely proportionate relation between the predicted strength and the void volume fraction.

        <p>The cohesive crack model used here is dependent on the normal and shear cohesive strengths t n and t s (=t n ) and the corresponding failure separations. The failure separations can be calculated from the fracture energy G F when the linear softening traction-separation curve is used. So the most pronounced effects of material inputs come from t n and G F that are assigned to cohesive elements CIE_INT and CIE_CEM. Parametric studies using the mesh in Fig. 4 were thus conducted to investigate their effects. The values in Table 1, namely, t nc = 6 MPa and G Fc = 0.06 N/mm for cement paste, and t ni = 3 MPa and G Fi = 0.03 N/mm for the aggregate-cement interfaces, were used by default. In a parametric analysis, only one of these four parameters was varied for each simulation with other three taking the default values. Fig. 22a shows the effects of interfacial cohesive strength t ni . It can be seen that the interfacial cohesive strength is the dominant factor governing the specimen strength. This is because the higher cement paste cohesive strength t nc = 6 MPa meant that the fracture always originated from microcracks on the interfaces. The effects of the interfacial fracture energy G Fi are shown in Fig. 22b. It is clear that it has no significant influence on the specimen strength but very significant influence on the post-peak softening responses. Fig. 22c shows that the fracture energy of the cement paste cohesive elements G Fc affects the softening stage too, but not by as much as the interfacial facture energy. The effects of cement paste cohesive strength t nc are shown in Fig. 22d. The specimen strength jumps from 2.7 MPa for t nc = 3 MPa to 3.4 MPa for t nc = 6 MPa, but further strengthening becomes insignificant when t nc is above 6 MPa. This is related to the micro/macro-cracking processes.The cohesive crack model used here is dependent on the normal and shear cohesive strengths t n and t s (=t n ) and the corresponding failure separations.

        <p>Fig. 23a and b shows the pre-peak microcracks in cement paste and on the interfaces for t nc = 3 MPa, respectively, compared with Fig. 23c andd for t nc = 6 MPa at the same loading. It is clear that when the cohesive strength in cement paste and on the interfaces are the same (t nc = t ni = 3 MPa), comparable numbers of microcracks occur in both cement paste and interfaces, whereas most of them lie on the interfaces when the cement paste strength is doubled. This results in quite different final macrocrack patterns, as shown in Fig. 24a and b for t nc = 3 MPa and 12 MPa. Therefore, the relative ratio of cohesive strength in cement paste and interfaces plays an important role in the microcracking behaviour, which in turn affects the macrocracking behaviour and the load-carrying capacity of structures.Fig. 23a and b shows the pre-peak microcracks in cement paste and on the interfaces for t nc = 3 MPa, respectively, compared with Fig. 23c andd for t nc = 6 MPa at the same loading.

        <p>2D meso-scale FE models have been developed based on high-resolution X-ray CT images to simulate crack propagation processes in concrete under uniaxial tension loading. The flexibility and effectiveness of pre-inserting CIE technique in modelling realistic, complicated fracture processes are illustrated by good qualitative and quantitative agreement of predicted results with experimental observations and other simulations. It is found that a large number of interfacial microcracks initiate very quickly and gradually become stable before the peak load is reached. Then the interfacial cracks continue to propagate and coalesce with newly formed cracks in the cement paste phase. The localised fracture shows the crack path is formed by bridging the initiated interfacial microcracks and meanwhile nearby cracks become unloaded and close up. The very different load-carrying capacities and crack patterns at different locations in the same specimen demonstrate not only the effects of random distribution of phases, which can only be captured by realistic meso-scale simulations, but also the limitations of 2D modelling and the necessity of 3D modelling which is currently under way. This study also shows that there exists a statistically inversely proportionate relation between the predicted tensile strength and the void volume fraction, and the relative ratio of cohesive strength in cement paste and aggregate-cement interfaces is a dominant factor in the microcracking behaviour, which in turn affects macrocracking and load-carrying capacities of specimens.2D meso-scale FE models have been developed based on high-resolution X-ray CT images to simulate crack propagation processes in concrete under uniaxial tension loading.
