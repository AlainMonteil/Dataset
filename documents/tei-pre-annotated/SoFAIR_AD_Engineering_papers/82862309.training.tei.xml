        <p>Extracellular agents produced by newly isolated bacterial strains were able to catalyze the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The most effective isolates were identified as Bacillus pumilus, B. persicus, and Bacillus licheniformis using molecular identification. DLS analysis revealed that the AgNPs synthesized by the above strains were in the size range of 77-92 nm. TEM observations showed that the nanoparticles were coated with a capping agent, which was probably involved in nanoparticle stabilization allowing their perfect dispersion in aqueous solutions. FTIR analyses indicated the presence of proteins in the capping agent of the nanoparticles and suggested that the oxidation of hydroxyl groups of peptide hydrolysates (originated from the growth medium) is coupled to the reduction of silver ions. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy confirmed the above results. The nanoparticles, especially those synthesized by B. licheniformis, were stable (zeta potential ranged from -16.6 to -21.3 mV) and showed an excellent in vitro antimicrobial activity against important human pathogens and a considerable antiviral activity against the Bean Yellow Mosaic Virus. The significance of the particular antiviral activity is highlighted, given the significant yield reduction in fava bean crops resulting from Bean Yellow Mosaic Virus infections, in many African countries.Extracellular agents produced by newly isolated bacterial strains were able to catalyze the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs).

        <p>Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) attracted the attention of many research groups working on different fields thanks to their unique features and large range of applications (Galdiero et al., 2011), such as in food technology, medicine, agriculture, and environmental technology (Lu et al., 2009;Sastry et al., 2010).Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) attracted the attention of many research groups working on different fields thanks to their unique features and large range of applications (Galdiero et al., 2011), such as in food technology, medicine, agriculture, and environmental technology (Lu et al., 2009;Sastry et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>In medicine, AgNPs are considered novel therapeutic agents, displaying important antiviral activity against monkey poxvirus (Rogers et al., 2008), herpes simplex virus (Baram et al., 2010), HIV (Lara et al., 2010), and hepatitis B virus (Lu et al., 2008). The AgNPs synthesized by Aspergillus spp. effectively inhibited the proliferation of bacteriophage in host bacteria (Narasimha et al., 2012). Studies on metal nanoparticles, especially on those produced with silver or gold, revealed that nanoparticles exhibit a veridical activity against a broad spectrum of viruses, and surely reduce viral infectivity of cultured cells (Galdiero et al., 2011). Antimicrobial (mainly anti-bacterial), anti-cancerous and anti-inflammatory activities of nanoparticles have been reported (Kim et al., 2007;Kuo et al., 2009). However, despite the financial interest, there are very few reports on the effectiveness of AgNPs against plant viruses. For instance, the effective control of Bean Yellow Mosaic Virus (BYMV), genus Potyvirus family Potyviridae, would be of high interest for many African countries, which can suffer significant yield reductions in fava bean crops upon viral infection leading to considerable economic losses (Radwan et al., 2008).In medicine, AgNPs are considered novel therapeutic agents, displaying important antiviral activity against monkey poxvirus (Rogers et al., 2008), herpes simplex virus (Baram et al., 2010), HIV (Lara et al., 2010), and hepatitis B virus (Lu et al., 2008).

        <p>The antimicrobial activity of AgNPs is attributed to cell death as a result of sequestration and inactivation of vital sub-cellular organelles, for which the silver ions have high affinity (Silver et al., 2006). It has also been suggested that AgNPs inhibit viral nucleic acid replication while their antiviral activity depends on the particle size, as well as on the distribution of interacting ligand/receptor molecules (Lu et al., 2009;Papp et al., 2010).The antimicrobial activity of AgNPs is attributed to cell death as a result of sequestration and inactivation of vital sub-cellular organelles, for which the silver ions have high affinity (Silver et al., 2006).

        <p>AgNPs can be produced either by conventional or biological methods. Although the processes that use conventional methods for AgNPs synthesis, i.e., physical, chemical, and hybrid methods S.. (Mazumdar and Ahmed, 2012;Wang et al., 2013) are highly efficient and productive enough, their application in large scale is highly restricted by several factors, including the unsafe chemicals employed, the high demand of energy, the undesirable side-products formed during synthesis and the inefficient so far purification (Kowshik et al., 2003). Moreover, the nanoparticles synthesized by these methods are frequently contaminated with toxic compounds, fact that limits their applicability, especially in medicine (Jain et al., 2011). Alternatively, harmless and satisfactorily effective methods have been proposed for AgNPs nanoparticles synthesis in which selected gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria strains are involved (Vigneshwaran et al., 2007;Prabhu, 2010).AgNPs can be produced either by conventional or biological methods.

        <p>Despite the importance of biosynthesized AgNPs nanoparticles, our understanding of the relevant biochemical pathways is incomplete. Presumably, extracellular molecules of biological origin, such as enzymes, vitamins and polysaccharides may act as reducing and capping agents during nanosilver formation (Collera et al., 2005). It has been suggested that the NADPH-dependent nitrate reductase plays a key role in nanosilver synthesis catalyzing the reduction of silver ion, reaction that induces the nanoparticle formation (Kalimuthu et al., 2008;Kumar et al., 2008).Despite the importance of biosynthesized AgNPs nanoparticles, our understanding of the relevant biochemical pathways is incomplete.

        <p>Several microorganisms are known for their ability to synthesize nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the research for new strains, able to carry out a reliable biosynthesis of nanoparticles with certain properties, such as high stability, monodispersity, or having a particular composition and size, is at the forefront of nanotechnological research. Here, we describe new bacterial strains, able to synthesize AgNPs with important antiviral and antimicrobial activities. The nanoparticles synthesized by three isolates were extensively characterized using physical and chemical methods (including spectrophotometry, electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy-EDX and Fourier transform infrared-FTIR analysis). The antimicrobial activity of the nanoparticles was tested against important human pathogens, while their antiviral activity was in vivo evaluated against BYMV. In conclusion, the biosynthesized AgNPs are quite stable in aqueous solution showing, especially those synthesized by Bacillus licheniformis, an excellent in vitro antimicrobial activity against human pathogens and a considerable antiviral activity against BYMV.Several microorganisms are known for their ability to synthesize nanoparticles.

        <p>The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of AgNPs were determined by the two-fold broth dilution method using the Mueller Hinton II (M-H) broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, US) following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. From a stock suspension of AgNPs (100 µg/ml in ultra-pure distilled water) a two-fold serial dilutions were prepared in the M-H broth. Bacteria cells, found in the exponential growth phase, were inoculated in the wells of a 96-microwell plate containing either M-H broth alone (positive control), or M-H broth containing AgNPs at a final AgNPs concentration ranging from 1.5 to 100 µg/ml. The microplates were then incubated at 37 • C for 12 h. The MIC value corresponded to the AgNPs dose that inhibited bacterial growth (when compared to the positive control) and the MBC value, to the AgNPs dose where 100% of the bacterial cells were destroyed. MBC was also evaluated by sub-culturing the content of the first two clear wells obtained in the MIC assay onto M-H agar plates.

        <p>The anti-viral activity of the AgNPs was tested in vivo against the BYMV, which is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. BYMV was collected from fava bean plants displaying severe yellow mosaic, mottling, crinkling, size reduction and leaf distortion and stored in 70% ethanol for later identification. The samples were serologically examined for BYMV, using specific polyclonal antibodies with direct ELISA test. Specifically, all samples were examined in triplicate using conventional DAS-ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sanofi-Santi animal, France), reading the optical density at λ = 405 nm in an ELISA micro-well reader (Dynatech Immunoassay MR 7000) (Clark and Adams, 1977). Leaf samples that gave positive reaction with specific BYMV antibodies were used for BYMV inoculation of fava bean cv. Giza 3. In particular, the virus inoculum was prepared after grinding the infected leaves in a mortar containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, at a ratio1:2 w/v. The homogenate was filtrated through a double layer of muslin, and the leaves of healthy fava bean seedlings were dusted with carborundum and rubbed gently with a cotton swab previously dipped into the virus suspension containing 10 -3 -10 -4 virions.

        <p>The screen of isolates for AgNPs rapidly synthesizing strains resulted in the initially named strains NPs-1, 2, and 3. The particular strains were found to produce extracellular agents that efficiently catalyze the synthesis of AgNPs, as it was suggested by the rapid and stable color change of the AgNO 3 solution from yellow to dark brown within a few hours of exposure (Figure 1). Indeed, the dark brown color remained stable for at least 48 h, indicating the long-term stability of the synthesized nanoparticles, an important property when biotechnological applications are considered. The AgNPs formation was confirmed by the presence of characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of silver nanoparticles at 450 nm measured by UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Figure 2). No AgNPs synthesis was observed in control flasks containing 20 ml of NB (instead of bacterial supernatant) and AgNO 3 at 1mM, confirming that AgNPs synthesis was mediated by extracellular agents of bacterial origin.The screen of isolates for AgNPs rapidly synthesizing strains resulted in the initially named strains NPs-1, 2, and 3.

        <p>The above strains were identified to species-level using PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, 
            <rs type="software">BLAST</rs> analysis, and comparison with known sequences of the GenBank nucleotide database as Bacillus pumilus, B. persicus, and B. licheniformis and the respective nanoparticles were named NPs-1, NPs-2, and NPs-3. The sequences of B. pumilus, B. persicus, and B. licheniformis were deposited at the Genbank and received the accession numbers of KJ743246, KJ743245, and KJ743244, respectively. Detailed information concerning the 16S rRNA of the three isolates is provided in the Figures S1-S3 and Table S1 (see Supplemental Materials).

        <p>The above isolates were cultivated on NB medium for 24 h. Subsequently, the supernatants (free of any kind of precipitates) were used as catalysts for AgNPs synthesis. Silver nitrate exposure to the cell-free supernatants of B. pumilus, B. persicus, and B. licheniformis resulted in a time-dependent color change of the reaction mixture from yellowish to brown (Figure 1), suggesting AgNPs biosynthesis. Further, the formation of AgNPs was detected and monitored over time by UV-Vis absorption spectrum scanning in the range of 200-1000 nm (Figure 2). As illustrated in the UV-VIS spectra the absorbance intensity gradually increased with time without any shift of the wavelength in which the maximum absorbance was observed, denoting a continuous reduction of silver nitrate and, consequently, an increase in AgNPs concentration. Comparison of FTIR spectra of NPs-1, NPs-2, and NPs-3 indicated only minor differences in both the bands position and the absorption intensity (Figure 3). Specifically, the analysis revealed the existence of a band at 3373 cm -1 in the FTIR spectrograms and a strong peak at 3300-3500 cm -1 . The peak at about 2359 cm -1 was also remarkable.

Control wells containing the supernatants derived from the bacterial cultures showed no inhibition (Figure S4). Although control containing AgNO 3 in NB showed an antimicrobial activity (data not shown), this activity increased considerably when AgNPs were used. NP-3 synthesized by B. licheniformis exhibited the highest inhibitory effect against Gram negative bacteria including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. sonnei, P. aeruginosa, followed by Gram positive S. epidermidis, MRSA and S. bovis.

        <p>Leaves of fava bean infected with BYMV showed severe symptoms, including yellow mosaic, mottling, crinkling, size reduction and deformation (Figure 8A), symptoms that were absent from the non-infected leaves. Moreover, BYMV coat protein (cp) gene was detected using RT-PCR (Figure 8B) in six samples of infected leaves, whereas no product was amplified from healthy plants. In ultrathin sections of broad bean leaves inoculated with BYMV, viral particles elongated and flexuous, 750 nm long and 15 nm wide, as well as inclusion bodies containing elongated pinwheel structures, typical of potyviruses, were observed (Figure 9). AgNPs synthesized by B. pumilus, B. persicus, and B. licheniformis had no effect on the healthy plants (data not shown), which was a prerequisite for the potential use of nanoparticles in agriculture. However, the treatment of infected plants with AgNPs induced different plant responses, depending on the treatment time (pre-, along with-or post-viral infection). In particular, the pre-infection treatment with AgNPs (i.e., 72 h prior to inoculation), had no effect neither on the virus concentration nor on the severity of the disease (Figure 10, Table 3). On the contrary, remarkable results were observed in the post-infection treatment (i.e., 24 h after inoculation) in which every one of NPs-1, NPs-2, and NPs-3 prevented all destructive symptoms caused by the virus, while weak BYMV symptoms were observed when plants were treated by AgNPs simultaneously with the infection.Leaves of fava bean infected with BYMV showed severe symptoms, including yellow mosaic, mottling, crinkling, size reduction and deformation (Figure 8A), symptoms that were absent from the non-infected leaves.

Specifically, FTIR analysis can be used for the detection of potential interactions between silver salt and extracellular proteins that are involved in AgNPs formation (Saha et al., 2010), while it has been suggested that this analysis provides information about the binding of proteins to AgNPs leading to nanoparticles stabilization (Jain et al., 2011).

        <p>DLS analysis revealed that the size of AgNPs synthesized by B. pumilus, B. persicus, and B. licheniformis was in average 80, 92, and 77 nm, respectively. The morphology of the AgNPs has been illustrated using TEM that provides descriptive images revealing also the AgNPs distribution (Nagati et al., 2012). It is important that the AgNPs are not agglomerated, even within the aggregates, and coated with an organic layer, indicating stabilization of the nanoparticles by a capping agent. Capping agents are keycomponents of nanoparticles allowing a perfect dispersion of nanoparticles in the bio-reduced aqueous solution (Kathiresan et al., 2010). We obtained highly confirmative results by EDX analysis, proving the existence of elemental silver. The optical absorption peak of silver nano-crystals arises at about 3 KeV, which is similar to that of metallic silver nano-crystals due to SPR (Park et al., 2007). Other EDX signals emitted from O, N, and C are probably due to X-ray emission from proteins presented in the cell free filtrates (Das et al., 2010) that can bind to nanoparticles either through free amino groups or cysteine residues (Mandal et al., 2005).

        <p>The antibacterial activity of AgNPs increased considerably with the decrease of the particles size. Therefore, the smallest AgNPs (having an average diameter = 77 nm) synthesized by B. licheniformis exhibited the higher inhibitory effect mainly against Gram negative, but also against Gram positive bacteria. Their antifungal activity was also significant. Similar conclusions are derived when MIC and MBC values are considered. Furthermore, the bacterial growth curves obtained in the presence of AgNPs indicated a significant prolongation of the lag phase provoked by AgNPs, while NPs-3 completely inhibited growth of E. coli and S. aureus.The antibacterial activity of AgNPs increased considerably with the decrease of the particles size.

        <p>Accordingly, it has been reported that antimicrobial activity is dose and size dependent and more obvious against Gram negative than Gram positive bacteria (Singh et al., 2008). Presumably, the Gram negative cell wall, composed of thin peptidoglycan layer, is more susceptible to AgNPs permeation when compared to the Gram positive cell wall, which is consisted of a thicker peptidoglycan layer, creating an effective barrier against the AgNPs penetration, assumption that is in agreement with previous reports (Rai et al., 2009). Marambio-Jones and Hoek (2010) suggest that Ag + ions of AgNPs attached to the negatively charged cell surface alter the physical and chemical properties of cell membranes and disturb important functions such as permeability, osmoregulation, electron transport and respiration. According to Rajeshkumar and Malarkodi (2014) the silver nanoparticles may also directly interact with the microbial cells. Specifically, silver ions can inhibit the respiratory chain enzymes and the permeability to phosphate and protons (e.g., by interrupting transmembrane electron transfer, oxidizing cell components, disrupting and penetrating the cell covering making it susceptible to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) or dissolving heavy metal ions that cause damages). Moreover, further damage to bacterial cells can be caused by permeating the cell, where they interact with proteins, DNA and other sulfur-and phosphorus-containing cell constituents (Nayak et al., 2015).Accordingly, it has been reported that antimicrobial activity is dose and size dependent and more obvious against Gram negative than Gram positive bacteria (Singh et al., 2008).

Similar symptoms have been recorded in previous papers (Arneodo et al., 2005;Radwan et al., 2008;EL-Bramawy and El-Beshehy, 2012) for other beans (i.e., Phaseolus vulgaris and Glycine max) infected with BYMV or related potyviruses such as Zucchini yellow mosaic virus. Further, the presence of BYMV in infected leaves was confirmed using RT-PCR, while viral particles, as well inclusion bodies containing typical of potyviruses elongated pinwheel structures, were observed. The development of pinwheel structures associated with laminated aggregates composed of closely apprised proteinaceous sheets is a characteristic feature of Potyviruses belonging to subdivision II (Radwan et al., 2008).BYMV infection caused severe symptoms to fava bean plants such as yellow mosaic, mottling and so on (see above).

        <p>The most effective treatment of infected plants with AgNPs was that applied 24 h after inoculation (post-infection treatment). In particular, the post-infection treatment with NPs-3 led to an important decrease in virus concentration, percentage of infection and disease severity. Correspondingly, it has been reported that the AgNPs are effective against a prototype arena virus when administered early after initial virus exposure (Speshock et al., 2010). These findings may suggest that the AgNPs activity is more dramatic at the early phases of viral replication. However, weak or zero reduction in virus concentration, percentage of infection and disease severity was observed when AgNPs were sprayed at the pre-viral infection stage, indicating inability of the AgNPs to activate the inducible systemic resistance of the plant against BYMV infection.The most effective treatment of infected plants with AgNPs was that applied 24 h after inoculation (post-infection treatment).

        <p>Remarkably, the most effective AgNPs (causing nearly complete suppression of viral infection) were those produced by B. licheniformis having the smallest size (9-11 nm), findings which are in accordance with those reported in Lu et al. (2008). Additionally, in the later paper the authors, analyzing monodispersed AgNPs for their ability to inhibit replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV), reported that the large AgNPs were toxic for the cell as well, but the smaller particles showed a minor toxicity at the concentration needed for inhibition of HBV replication. The same trend, with a more pronounced activity, was observed in influenza virus inhibition assays demonstrating that the activity clearly depends on the particle dimension and the spatial distribution of the interacting ligand/receptor molecules (Papp et al., 2010). It has been shown that, besides the immediate interaction with glycoprotein of the virus surface, AgNPs may enter the cell and fulfill their antiviral activity through interactions with the viral nucleic acids (Galdiero et al., 2011).Remarkably, the most effective AgNPs (causing nearly complete suppression of viral infection) were those produced by B. licheniformis having the smallest size (9-11 nm), findings which are in accordance with those reported in Lu et al.

        <p>In conclusion, this research paper provides new insights in the synthesis of AgNPs through reductive reactions that are induced by biological agents of bacterial origin. Newly isolated strains of B. pumilus, B. persicus, and B. licheniformis produced extracellular agents (i.e., peptides) that were able to catalyze the synthesis of AgNPs. Specifically, the oxidation of the hydroxyl groups of extracellular peptides was probably involved in the reduction of silver ions leading to nanoparticles formation. The synthesized AgNPs were quite stable in the reaction mixture, mono-dispersed, of various shapes and were coated with an organic layer in which proteins participated. The nanoparticles, especially those synthesized by B. licheniformis, showed an excellent in vitro antimicrobial activity against important human pathogens and a considerable antiviral activity against BYMV infection, which is of importance for many African countries, since it may cause a significant yield reduction in fava bean crops. This information is valuable for future registration and labeling of the AgNPs as antiviral agents for crop protection and for further elucidation of the mechanisms involved in virus inactivation.In conclusion, this research paper provides new insights in the synthesis of AgNPs through reductive reactions that are induced by biological agents of bacterial origin.
