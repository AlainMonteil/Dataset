        <p>Most optical metamaterials fabricated and studied to date employ metallic components resulting in significant losses, heat and overall low efficiencies. A new era of metamaterial physics is associated with all-dielectric meta-optics, which employs electric and magnetic Mie resonances of subwavelength particles with high refractive index for an optically induced magnetic response, thus underpinning a new approach to design and fabricate functional and practical metadevices. Here we review the recent developments in meta-optics and subwavelength dielectric photonics and demonstrate that the Mie resonances can play a crucial role in the realization of the unique functionalities of meta-atoms, also driving novel effects in the fields of metamaterials and nanophotonics. We discuss the recent research frontiers in all-dielectric meta-optics and uncover how Mie resonances can be employed for a flexible control of light with full phase and amplitude engineering, including unidirectional metadevices, highly transparent metasurfaces, non-linear nanophotonics and topological photonics.Most optical metamaterials fabricated and studied to date employ metallic components resulting in significant losses, heat and overall low efficiencies.

        <p>Electromagnetic metamaterials, artificial media in which subwavelength electromagnetic constituents replace atoms as the basic structural elements to control the light-matter interaction, have led to the prediction and observation of many novel optical phenomena that are not available or are much weaker in natural materials [1][2][3][4][5]. This includes a negative index of refraction, invisibility cloaking, giant chirality, etc. Many such important phenomena are the manifestation of optical magnetism, predicted and observed in specifically designed artificial subwavelength structures that allow a strong magnetic response, even when such structures are made of non-magnetic materials. Indeed, although real quantum-origin magnetism in its conventional sense is not available at high optical frequencies, the metamaterial concept allows the design of artificial 'meta-atoms' to engineer macroscopic magnetic permeability μ and magnetic response by achieving strong resonances in structured non-magnetic systems, through the spatial dispersion and non-local electric-field effects, inducing a strong magneticdipole moment.Electromagnetic metamaterials, artificial media in which subwavelength electromagnetic constituents replace atoms as the basic structural elements to control the light-matter interaction, have led to the prediction and observation of many novel optical phenomena that are not available or are much weaker in natural materials [1][2][3][4][5].

        <p>The most popular constitutive elements of metamaterials are split-ring resonators, cut-wire pairs and metal-dielectric layered structures with the so-called fishnet geometry [3]. Such classical 'meta-atoms' are made of metals where free electrons oscillate back and forth, creating effective loops of current, thus inducing an efficient magnetic response. The meta-atom in the form of a split-ring resonator was first introduced at microwaves to realize artificial magnetically active inclusions with subwavelength footprints, and then it was translated to the optics exploiting the plasmonic features of metallic nanoparticles [3]. This concept was realized in many non-magnetic plasmonic structures ranging from nanobars [6] and nanoparticle oligomers [7,8] to split-ring-based structures [9,10] and more complex metal-dielectric layered structures associated with hyperbolic-type electric and magnetic response of metamaterials [11,12]. These earlier results created a platform for the subsequent development of the entirely new fields of metadevices [13] as well as metasurfaces and metalenses [14,15].The most popular constitutive elements of metamaterials are split-ring resonators, cut-wire pairs and metal-dielectric layered structures with the so-called fishnet geometry [3].

        <p>The idea of using metallic elements in metamaterials is based on the main assumption that the subwavelength trapping of light may occur due to the localization of electromagnetic waves at metallic interfaces in the form of surface plasmon polaritons. Plasmonic resonators are always accompanied by losses because of their response nature: in order to achieve the resonant behavior for subwavelength plasmonic resonators, part of the optical energy must be stored in the kinetic energy of electrons [16]. Even high-T c superconductors cannot be a good alternative for noble metals because they would have to operate at energies less than the superconductive gap, being in the THz or far-IR frequency range [17]. The use of highly doped semiconductors in place of metal is also not a panacea because the decline of the Fermi level necessarily means a decrease in the plasma frequency and, thus, lowering of surface and localized plasmonic resonances, where the noble metals demonstrate superior properties. In particular, doped semiconductors with lower losses have been proposed as new plasmonic materials to replace noble metals [18][19][20]. However, recent studies suggest that noble metals outperform doped semiconductors even with their larger ohmic losses because of the inherently higher plasma frequencies in metals. While the intrinsic loss in doped semiconductors can be an order of magnitude lower than in metals, their electron densities and thus plasma frequencies are at least thirty times smaller.The idea of using metallic elements in metamaterials is based on the main assumption that the subwavelength trapping of light may occur due to the localization of electromagnetic waves at metallic interfaces in the form of surface plasmon polaritons.

        <p>By now, it has become clear that practically useful methods to control light-matter interactions at the nanoscale need to go beyond plasmonics. Probably the most disruptive strategy would be to replace metals by all-dielectric components with high refractive index, supporting the light localization due to dielectric resonators, and provide fine control over the amplitude, phase and polarization of light. Because this approach requires nanostructures of the order of a few hundred nanometers, the ability to describe composite media by averaged parameters via the homogenization procedure can be lost, so such structures should be classified from the viewpoint of 'meta-optics' rather than 'metamaterials'. On the other hand, the use of silicon and other semiconductors brings the great advantage of CMOS compatibility that will be appreciated in practical applications [21].By now, it has become clear that practically useful methods to control light-matter interactions at the nanoscale need to go beyond plasmonics.

        <p>As mentioned above, the magnetic response of many natural materials at optical frequencies is very weak. Thus, only the electric component of light is directly controlled in many optical devices. However, artificial magnetism can be achieved at high frequencies in nanostructured materials. One of the canonical examples is the split-ring resonator (SRR), shown in Fig. 1(a), an inductive metallic ring with a gap (a building block of a majority of metamaterials) that can support an oscillating current, giving rise to an optically induced magnetic moment. However, intrinsic losses of metals set the fundamental limit for the use of SRRs at optical frequencies. This is where high-index dielectric (e.g. silicon) nanoparticles of hundreds of nanometers make an attractive alternative [27]. According to the Mie theory, dielectric nanoparticles can exhibit strong magnetic resonances in the visible [28]. The basic physics of the excitation of such modes is similar to that of SRRs, provided that the electron current in metals is replaced by the displacement current in dielectrics, but silicon nanoparticles have much lower losses. A magnetic resonance originates from the excitation of a particular electromagnetic mode inside the nanoparticle with a circular displacement current of the electric field. This mode is excited when the wavelength of light in the material becomes comparable to the particle's diameter. It has an antiparallel polarization of the electric field at opposite sides of the particle while the magnetic field oscillates up and down in the middle [29] (see Fig. 1 This fundamental phenomenon of strong magnetic resonances in optics was independently observed experimentally throughout the whole visible spectral range from violet to red for silicon nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 100 to 270 nm [30] and 200 to 265 nm [31]. Thus, it makes silicon nanoparticles good candidates for lossless magnetic response at high frequencies and lossless metamaterials, in sharp contrast to plasmonic nanoparticles of the same size and geometry [27] (see Fig. 1(c) and(d)).As mentioned above, the magnetic response of many natural materials at optical frequencies is very weak.

        <p>Dielectric nanoparticles with strong magnetic response can be used as building blocks to explore new types of multipolar interaction at the nanoscale [32]. Coupling of silicon nanoparticles and SRRs allows control of the magnetic interaction between optically induced dipole moments. If the spacing between a nanoparticle and an SRR becomes smaller than a critical value, the induced magnetization can be inverted [33,34]. This approach can be generalized to construct a variety of hybrid structures supporting and controlling optically induced spin waves.Dielectric nanoparticles with strong magnetic response can be used as building blocks to explore new types of multipolar interaction at the nanoscale [32].

        <p>To understand the major characteristics of light scattering at the nanoscale, one usually employs the multipole decomposition of electromagnetic fields. In this way, the Mie scattering is characterized by partial intensities and radiation patterns of dominant excited multipole modes, not only the electric and magnetic dipoles but also higher-order multipolar modes and modes with toroidal geometry. For metallic nanoparticles, the electric-dipole mode usually dominates the Mie scattering. In contrast, incorporating the optical magnetic response for dielectric particles provides an extra degree of freedom for efficient light control, through interference of electric and magnetic dipoles and multipolar modes. In the simplest case, when multipole modes are of the same type and are produced by different elements, the interference physics of dielectric nanoparticles is associated with Fano resonances, and it resembles plasmonic analogues [35]. Nanoparticle structures demonstrate sharp Fano resonances with characteristic asymmetric scattering due to interference between non-radiative and radiative modes. Importantly, magnetic-dipole resonances of individual dielectric particles play a crucial role in the appearance of the Fano resonances [36][37][38].To understand the major characteristics of light scattering at the nanoscale, one usually employs the multipole decomposition of electromagnetic fields.

        <p>The possibility of exciting simultaneously both magnetic-and electric-dipole modes may lead to entirely new classes of scattering phenomena. Kerker [39] revealed that it is possible to suppress the backscattering by using a hypothetical nanoparticle made of a material with identical electric permittivity and magnetic permeability μ. This condition implies that two excited dipole modes have equal amplitudes, and they interfere destructively in the backward direction.The possibility of exciting simultaneously both magnetic-and electric-dipole modes may lead to entirely new classes of scattering phenomena.

A superposition of electric and magnetic resonances of a single core-shell nanoparticle results in the suppression of the backward scattering and unidirectional emission by a single subwavelength element [40].

        <p>To explain the basic physics of these novel interference effects, we remind ourselves that, in the Rayleigh approximation, any single subwavelength element radiates light as an electric dipole, i.e. uniformly in the transverse direction relative to the dipole orientation. Thus, to control any radiation pattern, one needs to have at least two elements and take advantage of the interference of their radiative fields. An ideal optical nanoantenna would emit light predominantly in one predefined direction. The simplest structure exhibiting a unidirectional radiation pattern consists of two dipoles separated by a quarter of a wavelength with an additional π/2 phase shift between them (see Fig. 2(c)). It turns out that waves generated by such a dipole pair interfere constructively in one direction and destructively in the opposite direction. However, the interference condition implies that the system's size should remain of the order of a wavelength.To explain the basic physics of these novel interference effects, we remind ourselves that, in the Rayleigh approximation, any single subwavelength element radiates light as an electric dipole, i.e. uniformly in the transverse direction relative to the dipole orientation.

        <p>Dielectric nanoparticles with high refractive index offer new possibilities for achieving wave interference. Indeed, the coexistence of both electric and magnetic resonances results in unidirectional scattering (see Fig. 2(a)). This property makes subwavelength dielectric nanoparticles the smallest and most efficient nanoantennas. Moreover, unidirectionality can be swapped for different wavelengths. In particular, Fu et al.

Despite its simplicity, this well-known principle intuitively explains why shaping of a wavefront requires imprinting a spatially variant phase distribution onto an incident light field. Control over the wavefront of light is the key to many optical functionalities including focusing, beam shaping, beam deflection and holographic imaging. While conventional optical components providing these functionalities are rather bulky, optical metasurfaces (2D arrangements of designed nanophotonic building blocks) allow for wavefront shaping using just a sheet of nanoscale thickness. Metasurfaces consisting of planar arrangements of designed nanoresonators are of particular interest, as they can provide many degrees of freedom not supported by conventional phase masks, such as a tailored polarization response or engineered spatial or spectral dispersion.

        <p>In the last few years, a new way has been demonstrated to shape the wavefront of a light field with close-to-unity efficiency and full phase coverage. The very efficient approach to create highly transparent metasurfaces is based on disk-shaped silicon nanoresonators carefully designed to exhibit spectrally overlapping electric and magnetic dipolar Mie-type resonances [45]. Such nanoresonators scatter the incoming light almost entirely in the forward direction, thereby mimicking the forwardpropagating behavior of the elementary Huygens' sources [41,46] and making the metasurface highly transparent at the resonance. Furthermore, by using silicon as a constituent material, absorption losses become negligible at near-infrared operation wavelengths, thus boosting the metasurface efficiency compared to intrinsically lossy plasmonic metasurfaces. In combination, all the typical major loss channels of transmitting metasurfaces are eliminated in these silicon Huygens' metasurfaces [47].In the last few years, a new way has been demonstrated to shape the wavefront of a light field with close-to-unity efficiency and full phase coverage.

        <p>To demonstrate this concept for wavefront shaping with high efficiency, Chong et al. [48,49] designed, fabricated and characterized several wavefront-shaping metadevices (see also some related earlier [50] and more recent [51] papers). In order to implement the desired space-variant distribution of transmittance phases, they varied the lattice constant of the silicon nanoresonator arrays as a function of the in-plane sample position; see Fig. 3(a) and(b). This allows the transmission to be kept high enough, while covering a large phase range. Both devices have experimental transmittance efficiencies exceeding 70% and work for any input polarization. Furthermore, they demonstrated tuning of the resonance wavelength of silicon nanoresonator arrays using liquid crystals [52], paving the way towards dynamic wavefront control.

For example, an electric-dipole polarization follows the polar angle unit vector, whereas the field generated from a magnetic-dipole mode follows the azimuthal angle unit vector. This results in 'radial' polarization from an electric dipole in the projection plane perpendicular to the dipole moment and, correspondingly, 'azimuthal' polarization distribution from a magnetic dipole (see Fig. 5(f)).Generation of different localized modes can reshape completely the physics of non-linear effects at the nanoscale [78].

This anapole mode is associated with the concept of non-radiating current configurations, and in optics it can be viewed as an engineered superposition of electric and toroidal optical dipole moments, resulting in destructive interference of the radiation fields. This may happen due to a similarity of the far-field scattering patterns generated by an optical dipole mode and toroidal modes, and, usually, for the generation of toroidal modes in metamaterials, some more complex structures of nanoparticles are suggested [82]. However, dielectric nanoparticles can support the (almost radiationless) anapole mode, allowing an overlap of the toroidal and electric-dipole modes through geometry tuning, with a pronounced dip in the far-field scattering accompanied by the specific near-field distribution [80]. Importantly, these anapole modes can be employed to resolve a major challenge with the efficient coupling of light to nanoscale optical structures. Indeed, as has been shown theoretically [81], a nanoscale laser based on a tightly confined anapole mode in InGaAs nanodisks allows the efficient coupling of light into waveguide channels with four orders of magnitude intensity compared to classical nanolasers, as well as the generation of ultrafast (of 100 fs) pulses via spontaneous mode locking of several anapoles, offering an attractive platform for integrated photonics sources for advanced and efficient nanoscale circuitry.Another important mechanism for enhancing non-linear interactions at the nanoscale is to employ multipolar interference for creating a tight field confinement in the so-called optical anapole mode [80,81].

In particular, several approaches to engineer the non-linear properties of artificial materials, metamaterials and metasurfaces have been introduced, including highharmonic generation from ultrathin metasurfaces based on high-index dielectric resonators, as well as semiconductor-loaded metasurfaces.Given the inherently weak non-linear response of natural materials, non-linear metasurfaces [86,87] can be employed to realize significant non-linear responses in much smaller volumes, with current research devoted to the quest of synthesizing novel materials with enhanced optical nonlinearities at moderate input intensities.

        <p>One of the first demonstrations of a strong non-linear response of metasurfaces was reported [88] for n-doped multi-quantum-well semiconductor heterostructures employing intersubband transitions, with one of the largest known non-linear optical responses with a non-linear susceptibility of greater than 5 × 10 4 picometers per volt for secondharmonic generation under normal incidence. Such non-linear metasurfaces can be applied to engineer the Pancharatnam-Berry phase [89], thus establishing a platform to control the non-linear wavefront at will and design flat non-linear metasurfaces for ef-ficient second-harmonic radiation, including beam steering, focusing and polarization manipulation.One of the first demonstrations of a strong non-linear response of metasurfaces was reported [88] for n-doped multi-quantum-well semiconductor heterostructures employing intersubband transitions, with one of the largest known non-linear optical responses with a non-linear susceptibility of greater than 5 × 10 4 picometers per volt for secondharmonic generation under normal incidence.

        <p>The use of non-linear meta-atoms based on dielectric nanoparticles provides much higher conversion efficiencies for both second-and thirdorder non-linear processes. Recent studies suggest that non-linear nanoparticles can be employed for the demonstration of highly efficient all-dielectric non-linear metasurfaces. One design is a non-linear mirror based on the third-harmonic generation in dielectric metasurfaces that employs strong enhancement of THG in isolated silicon nanodisks optically pumped near the magnetic dipolar resonance [90]. The non-linear mirror generates a third harmonic from a laser with 1556 nm wavelength (thus, the third harmonic should be generated at 519 nm wavelength) in a way that the fundamental wave and the third harmonic are directed in opposite directions from the metasurface plane. After the interaction with the metasurface, all light at the fundamental wavelength gets reflected backward, and all light at the generated third harmonic gets transmitted forward. Such a non-linear mirror can be readily used as a frequency converter for laser cavities. The other type of non-linear mirror can act in the opposite way, transmitting light at the fundamental wavelength and directing the generated third harmonic backwards.The use of non-linear meta-atoms based on dielectric nanoparticles provides much higher conversion efficiencies for both second-and thirdorder non-linear processes.

        <p>These very recent findings open a new direction for non-linear optics, in which phase-matching issues are relaxed, and an unprecedented level of local wavefront control is achieved over thin devices with very large non-linear responses and very low losses.These very recent findings open a new direction for non-linear optics, in which phase-matching issues are relaxed, and an unprecedented level of local wavefront control is achieved over thin devices with very large non-linear responses and very low losses.</p>
        <p>For decades, many branches of physics have been dominated by lattice symmetries and chemical composition as the key concepts in the classification and design of various solid-state materials. However, it has recently been demonstrated that topology may be more important than symmetry in determining certain material properties. Topology is a subtle global property of the system governing how its parts connect. Connection of two topologically distinct materials results in the formation of peculiar states at the interface between them. These topological edge states have a built-in traffic control mechanism that enforces one-way propagation of electrons along the edges or interfaces and protects electron current from scattering on impurities. Materials insulating in a bulk but conducting at the surfaces through topological edge states were discovered in solid-state physics in 2006, and they are currently known as topological insulators [91]. The discovery of topological insulators has triggered a vast pursuit of novel topologically protected states of light creating a new field of topological photonics [92,93]. In solids, such states do not conduct any bulk current but possess conducting surfaces due to topologically protected edge states [94], which can carry current without dissipation even in the presence of impurities. By now, several sophisticated designs have been developed, and unidirectional photon transport has been predicted and demonstrated [92].For decades, many branches of physics have been dominated by lattice symmetries and chemical composition as the key concepts in the classification and design of various solid-state materials.

        <p>Poddubny et al. [96] suggested the first realization of subwavelength topological states at the nanoscale. They revealed that hybridization of the polarization-degenerate modes of a zigzag chain of plasmonic nanoparticles engenders a chiralsymmetric energy spectrum. The structure exhibits a topological transition when the chain changes its structure from a line to a zigzag, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Namely, the spectrum of a straight chain is topologically trivial; it has a vanishing parity of the winding number P. For the zigzag chain this Z 2 topological invariant is non-zero (see Fig. 6(b)), being the hallmark of the edge states at both chain edges [96].Poddubny et al.

        <p>Later, it was established that polymeric arrays of subwavelength silicon nanodisks can support two types of topological edge modes based on magnetic and electric Mie resonances, and their topological properties are fully dictated by the spatial arrangement of the nanoparticles in the array. Kruk et al. [99] observed experimentally and described theoretically topological phase transitions at the nanoscale controlling a change from trivial to non-trivial topological states when the edge mode is excited (see Fig. 6(c)), and they traced these topological phase transitions experimentally by employing near-field scanning optical microscopy.Later, it was established that polymeric arrays of subwavelength silicon nanodisks can support two types of topological edge modes based on magnetic and electric Mie resonances, and their topological properties are fully dictated by the spatial arrangement of the nanoparticles in the array.

        <p>Recently, Kruk et al. [100] demonstrated topology-enhanced THG at photonic edge states in zigzag arrays of silicon nanodisks. The harmonic generation was observed only for one direction of the plane-wave excitation, manifesting the non-linearity-induced non-reciprocal nature of the photonic topological states. Figure 6(d) shows the distribution of the third-harmonic radiation across the zigzag arrays for several different polarizations of the pump. They observed experimentally localized modes at the third-harmonic frequency when the laser pump excites the topological edge states. Non-linear effects are stronger for the edge states due to a higher concentration of the electric field. The observed edge-to-center intensity contrast is about 8. Selective excitation of the left or right edges is controllable by the polarization of the pump wave (shown by arrows in Fig. 6(d)). Namely, the edge is excited when the electric field is transverse to the link between the last pair of nanodisks. The electric-dipole attribution of the edge state was confirmed by full-wave numerical simulations [100].Recently, Kruk et al.

        <p>More recently, a proposal was made for alldielectric 3D meta-crystals consisting of resonant building blocks exhibiting electromagnetic duality between electric and magnetic fields that may be employed to create photonic topological insulators supporting propagating edge states [101]. In such systems, the magneto-electrical coupling plays the role of a synthetic gauge field that determines a topological transition to an 'insulating' regime with a complete photonic bandgap. The proposed all-dielectric meta-crystal design suggests the topological robustness of the surface states enabling reflectionless routing of electromagnetic radiation along arbitrarily shaped pathways in three dimensions (see Fig. 6, right column), which makes these modes promising for applications in photonics. This all-dielectric platform could also avoid undesirable effects such as ohmic loss, which is inevitably present in metallic and plasmonic structures.More recently, a proposal was made for alldielectric 3D meta-crystals consisting of resonant building blocks exhibiting electromagnetic duality between electric and magnetic fields that may be employed to create photonic topological insulators supporting propagating edge states [101].

        <p>Electromagnetic metamaterials were initially suggested for the demonstration of novel wave phenomena such as negative refraction, and later they were employed for engineering electromagnetic space with transformation optics. However, the overall demand for realistic applications of metamaterials in optics is growing, and it cannot be satisfied by conventional designs and concepts, which suffer from large losses in metallic components.
