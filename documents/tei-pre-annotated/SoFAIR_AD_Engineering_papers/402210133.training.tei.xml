However, comparing aerosol generation from different types of vocalization, including singing, across a range of volumes is a rapidly evolving area of research. Here, we measured aerosols from singing, speaking and breathing from a large cohort of 25 professional singers in a range of musical genres in a zero-background environment, allowing unequivocal attribution of aerosol production to specific vocalizations. We do not assess the relative volumes at which people speak and sing. However, both showed steep increases in mass concentration with increase in loudness (spanning a factor of 20-30 across the dynamic range measured, p&lt;0.001). At the quietest volume (50 to 60 dBA), neither singing (p=0.19) nor speaking (p=0.20) were significantly different to breathing. At the loudest volume (90 to 100 dBA), a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.001) was observed between singing and speaking, but with singing only generating a factor of between 1.5 and 3.4 more aerosol mass. Guidelines for musical performances should be based on the loudness and duration of the vocalization, the number of participants and the environment in which the activity occurs, rather than the type of vocalization.examples of clusters of COVID-19 following choral rehearsals.

Early in the pandemic, clusters of COVID-19 were considered to have arisen in several choirs around the world (Charlotte 2020;Miller et al. 2020). This rapidly led to many governments restricting or suspending singing. Concerns that woodwind and brass instruments might also be responsible for virus spread led to similar restrictions on the playing of wind instruments.Pandemic status was declared on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO), with in excess of 51.8 million cases and 1.28 million deaths reported worldwide by 13 th November 2020 (World Health Organisation 2020).

        <p>Consequently, large sections of the cultural sector, along with religious institutions and educational establishments, were unable to rehearse and perform, resulting in profound artistic, cultural, spiritual, emotional and social impacts.

The flux generated is proportional to the amplitude of phonation in speech (Alsved et al. 2020;Asadi et al. 2020). These actions release a plume of material containing particles of varying size, ranging from macroscopic mucosalivary droplets originating from the oral cavity and pharynx, to microscopic aerosols released by the small airways of the lungs (Asadi et al. 2020;Johnson et al. 2011;Morawska et al. 2009;Papineni and Rosenthal 1997). Traditionally, the division between droplets, which are considered to be of sufficient mass to sediment due to gravity, and aerosols, which remain airborne, is defined arbitrarily at 5 µm diameter (Xie et al. 2007;Nicas et al. 2005). However, particle composition and environmental properties like temperature, humidity and airflow influence the biophysical mechanics of the material released and the extent of transport (Tellier et al. 2019;Zayas et al. 2012;Xie et al. 2007;Nicas et al. 2005).Consequently, large sections of the cultural sector, along with religious institutions and educational establishments, were unable to rehearse and perform, resulting in profound artistic, cultural, spiritual, emotional and social impacts.

        <p>Several online reports have attempted to examine the quantities of particulate matter expelled by participants performing a range of activities including singing but have struggled to accurately quantify aerosol and droplets because of the large number of background particulates in the environment. This is the largest study to date with the objective of comparing the relative amounts of aerosols (up to ~10 µm diameter) generated by singing and speaking at the same loudness, and the first to present results from different genres, complementary to other studies with similar experimental aims (Alsved et al. 2020).Several online reports have attempted to examine the quantities of particulate matter expelled by participants performing a range of activities including singing but have struggled to accurately quantify aerosol and droplets because of the large number of background particulates in the environment.

        <p>We present results from a large cohort of 25 professional performers completing a range of exercises including breathing, speaking, coughing and singing in the clean air environment of an operating theatre with laminar flow ventilation. Measurements of particle number concentration alone would be insufficient to determine the total amount of viral material capable of being transmitted: the total mass of particulate matter produced may be a key factor in assessing the potential risk. Thus, measurements of particle size distributions, as well as concentration, are used to assess the mass concentration.We present results from a large cohort of 25 professional performers completing a range of exercises including breathing, speaking, coughing and singing in the clean air environment of an operating theatre with laminar flow ventilation.

        <p>Aerosol concentrations were measured from singing, speaking and breathing in a zero-background environment. The cohort of 25 professional singers performed a broad range of genres, including musical theatre (6), choral (5), opera (5), and other genres: gospel (2), rock (2), jazz (2), pop (1), actor with singing interest (1) and soul (1). 6 identified their voice-type as soprano or mezzo-soprano, 7 as alto, 5 as tenor and 7 as bass or baritone. Aerosol and droplet concentrations were measured with an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS, 500 nm -20 µm, see Aerosol Measurements) in an operating theatre with each participant and researcher required to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (hospital scrubs, theatre hat, and face mask if not the singing participant) (Figure 1a). The operating theatre had an ultra-clean ventilation system (e.g. EXFLOW 32; Howorth Air Technology, Farnworth, UK) which generates a surgical canopy of filtered air vertically downwards. Typically, the filter runs at 50 Hz, leading to a high air exchange rate of 500 -600 air changes per hour. This system reduced the pre-existing particle background number concentration to zero cm-3 .Thus, any particles detected were directly attributable to participant activity, with particle concentrations returning to zero cm -3 between periods of singing, speaking and breathing (Figure 1b). Temperature and relative humidity were typically 20 o C and 45%, respectively.Aerosol concentrations were measured from singing, speaking and breathing in a zero-background environment.

        <p>A standard operating procedure was adopted (see Vocalization experiments) covering 12 activities over ~1 hour, with each activity involving up to 5 repeat actions, with a 30 s pause between each repetition. These activities included breathing, coughing, singing single notes ("/ɑ/") at different pitches, and speaking and singing the "Happy Birthday" song at different loudness. At the beginning of each action, participants stepped forward to the funnel (Figure 1a) such that the dorsum of the nose was aligned to the plane of the base of the cone. Participant position relative to the funnel was monitored to ensure consistency (within 10 cm of the sampling tubes) across all measurements (Figure S1). As in previous studies (Alsved et al. 2020;Asadi et al. 2019;Johnson et al. 2011), we report concentrations sampled through the collection funnel, which allows comparison of particle emission rates on a relative basis between activities. In reality, particle concentrations will become rapidly diluted once particles are exhaled, leading to strong spatial variations.A standard operating procedure was adopted (see Vocalization experiments) covering 12 activities over ~1 hour, with each activity involving up to 5 repeat actions, with a 30 s pause between each repetition.

        <p>Previous studies attempted to minimize the sampling distance between the participant and the APS detection region (Asadi et al. 2019); logistical constraints required that we instead used conductive tubing to sample the aerosol from the performer into the APS. Not only did this allow space for the subject to stand comfortably next to the aerosol instrumentation in a normal performance posture, but it facilitated rapid set-up and dismantling of the instrumentation, essential within the frequently used operating theatre without the need for specialist platforms to mount the instruments. In addition, aerosol concentrations were measured in the same studies from brass and woodwind instruments; using flexible tubing facilitated the use of the same experimental set-up for both singing and for musical instrument, thus allowing direct comparison of aerosol concentrations between singer and instrumentalist. The conductive tubing was intentionally positioned to avoid tight curvature in the bends of the tube, maintaining a ratio of the radius of curvature (r c ) to the inner tube radius (r t ) greater than 50.

            <rs type="creator">Microsoft</rs>
            <rs type="software">Excel</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">Origin</rs> to analyze temporal trends in aerosol concentration, mass concentrations and size distributions. A software custom-written in 
            <rs type="software">LabVIEW</rs> was used to automate this process for improved efficiency of the data analysis. Measured total particle number concentrations were summed over the period of activity and divided by the duration of the activity, reporting a mean concentration (cm -3 ) with a standard deviation, i.e. the average concentration of particles sampled within the funnel volume during the activity. With coughs requiring &lt; 1 s, no averaging across a time-dependent concentration is possible and only the integrated number concentrations per single cough are reported.
        </p>
        <p>Further, particle size distributions were recorded by the APS at 1 s intervals, with 51 size bins equally spaced in the range 0.523 to 20 m in log(diameter) space. Average size distributions were calculated first by determining the mean size distribution for each participant and then calculating the mean and standard deviation across all participant size distributions for each activity. Mass concentrations were calculated assuming particle density was 1000 kg•m -3 . Our reported number concentrations and particle size distributions for speaking and breathing are consistent with previously published data (Asadi et al. 2019). We would caution the reader to recognize that, at the smallest particle sizes, the APS reported concentration is likely to be less accurate than that at the larger sizes. In particular, all particles smaller than 0.523 µm are put in a single size bin, providing no discrimination in size. That size bin (smaller A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t than 0.523 µm) was excluded from the analysis in this study. Thus, we report aerosol concentrations from 51 size bins, ranging from 0.523 to 20 µm in diameter.Further, particle size distributions were recorded by the APS at 1 s intervals, with 51 size bins equally spaced in the range 0.523 to 20 m in log(diameter) space.

        <p>The 
            <rs type="software">lme</rs> package in R-software was used to fit linear random effect models with log-base-e transformed particle concentration or mass as the dependent variable. The independent variables were activity (where loudness was considered as part of activity) or vocalization (speaking or singing) and acoustic loudness (50-60, 70-80 and 90-100 dBA); the random effect was participant identification number in both cases. In the second analysis, an interaction term between vocalization and loudness was considered but not found to be significant, so the final model does not include such a term. In the Figures, the lower and upper hinges (ends of boxes) correspond to the first and third quartile (the 25th and 75th percentiles). The upper whisker extends from the upper hinge to the largest value but no further than 1.5×IQR (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, the distance between the 1 st and 3 rd quartiles). The lower whisker extends from the lower hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5×IQR. Data beyond the ends of the whiskers are "outlying points" and indicated in red. All components of the box plots were calculated based on the logarithmically-transformed data, owing to lognormal nature of the data, but the plotted and tabular values reported are converted back to linear space for clarity.
        </p>
        <p>A complete analysis of the time-averaged total particle number and mass concentrations for all 25 participants is reported in Figure 2 and the absolute results summarized in Table 1; data normalized to the aerosol concentration from speaking at 70-80 dBA are compared in Figure S2 and Table S1. The aerosol number concentration generated across all participants took a log-normal distribution, consistent with the data presented in a previous publication; concentrations must always be positivevalued and a small number of individuals generate a significantly larger aerosol flux than the median (Asadi et al. 2019). This is particularly apparent for breathing, where measurements from individuals spanned almost three orders of magnitude. Indeed, 4 participants produced more aerosol in number concentration while breathing than while speaking at 90-100 dBA. The reproducibility of concentration from singing a single note (70-80 dBA) was not only apparent in single participant data (Figure 1b), but also across the cohort, with median concentrations in good agreement (0.83 and 0.91 cm -3 at beginning A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t and end, respectively). Using a mixed effects model where loudness was implicit (i.e. was considered as part of the activity), at the lowest volume (50-60 dBA), neither singing (p=0.19) nor speaking (p=0.20) was significantly different in particle production to breathing, with median number concentrations of 0.10 (IQR 0.07 -0.17), 0.19 (IQR 0.09 -0.30) and 0.28 (IQR 0.07 -0.64) cm -3 for speaking, singing and breathing, respectively. Where loudness is explicit and separate from activity a mixed effects model showed a statistically significant (p &lt; 1×10 -5 ) enhanced aerosol number concentration for singing when compared to speaking. This enhancement was small relative to the much larger changes associated with increase in loudness (p &lt; 0.001). Aerosol number concentration increased by a factor of 10-13 as loudness increased from 50-60 dBA to 90-100 dBA, suggesting that shouting should be associated with little difference in risk to singing at loud volume. This result is comparable with that from previous works. For example, Asadi et al. who also observed a linear increase in the mean generated aerosol number concentration from speech with increasing sound pressure level (dBA) when reported in log space, as in Figure 2a. They reported a factor of ~6.4 increase in particle number concentration generated by reading a passage of text at a 'near yelling' volume (95 dBA) compared to the lowest sound pressure they studied (60 dBA) (Asadi et al. 2019).A complete analysis of the time-averaged total particle number and mass concentrations for all 25 participants is reported in Figure 2 and the absolute results summarized in Table 1; data normalized to the aerosol concentration from speaking at 70-80 dBA are compared in Figure S2 and Table S1.

        <p>Alsved et al. also observed an increase in aerosol production with increasing sound pressure for two types of vocalization at two volumes. Going from 'normal' to 'high' sound pressure led to a greater sampled aerosol flux for speech (270 to 570 particles.s -1 , respectively) as well as for singing (690 to 980 particles.s -1 ) (Alsved et al. 2020).Alsved et al. also observed an increase in aerosol production with increasing sound pressure for two types of vocalization at two volumes.

        <p>The possibility that singing, speaking and breathing generate aerosol particles of different sizes cannot be inferred by comparing particle number concentrations alone. Instead, we must compare the aerosol size distributions from these activities. Previously, two overlapping modes in the size distribution of particles from speaking and coughing have been identified (Asadi et al. 2019;Johnson et al. 2011).The possibility that singing, speaking and breathing generate aerosol particles of different sizes cannot be inferred by comparing particle number concentrations alone.

The mode of lowest size is generated in the lower respiratory tract with a second mode generated in the region of the larynx, expected to be the most important in voicing.

        <p>Johnson et al. considered the influence of evaporation on the recorded size distribution and the reduction in moisture content that occurs when particles are exhaled from the warm and humid respiratory tract (Asadi et al. 2019). They presented parameterizations for both the uncorrected measured size distribution and also assuming a correction to account for the effect of evaporation on the size distribution (Johnson et al. 2011). In our work, the diameters of the exhaled aerosol droplets can be assumed to have decreased significantly due to evaporation before they were detected by the APS, in much the same way as recognized by Johnson et al. Given the hygroscopic growth curves of respiratory fluids remain uncertain at the very high humidities of the lung, and the RH and temperature of the airflow entering the APS inlet is ill-defined, we have chosen not to attempt to correct our particle sizes but instead compare our size distributions with the uncorrected parameterization from Johnson et al. in Figure 4a. With an estimated transit time of ~0.2 s from the sampling volume to the detector, we can assume that most of the size distribution had progressed fully or close to equilibration within this time window (Walker et al. 2020;Haddrell et al. 2019). Indeed, our distribution for speaking is in excellent agreement with the shape of the distribution reported by Johnson et al. for particles larger than 800 nm diameter up to above 7 m in diameter, and this size distribution is very similar to our observed distribution for singing. Although the absolute concentrations were a factor of ~6 larger in our A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t measurements, it should be recognized that the absolute value carries little meaning, reflecting only the instantaneous value recorded by the APS from the sampling funnel, which will depend on the sampling specifications (Asadi et al. 2019).Johnson et al. considered the influence of evaporation on the recorded size distribution and the reduction in moisture content that occurs when particles are exhaled from the warm and humid respiratory tract (Asadi et al. 2019).

        <p>[Figure 4] Measured size distributions for speaking and singing were fitted to bimodal lognormal distributions, consistent with previous studies for speaking, breathing and coughing (Asadi et al. 2019;Johnson et al. 2011;Morawska et al. 2009). The fits for the different levels of loudness and types of vocalization all gave very similar mean diameters and variance for both the lower respiratory tract and laryngeal modes, further supporting the conclusion that speaking and singing can be treated similarly, generating particles of similar size distributions (Table S2). However, both vocalizations generated larger particles than breathing: although the size distribution from breathing was well-represented by a bimodal lognormal distribution, the larger, laryngeal mode has shifted to a smaller diameter and had a narrower variance than for speaking and singing. The mean size distributions were normalized with respect to the greatest value of dN/d log(D p ) for each activity (Figure 4b), demonstrating the increase in concentration of particles generated in the laryngeal mode with respect to those from the lower respiratory tract, as vocalization loudness increased. Figure 4c compares the size distribution of particles generated from speaking at 90-100 dBA by three individual subjects that spanned the range in aerosol mass generated for this activity. The size distributions highlight the participant-to-participant variation, which spanned more than an order of magnitude in concentration of aerosol generated. However, the general shapes of the bimodal size distributions were similar in all cases with particles detected up to &gt;10 m diameter, albeit at very low concentration. The similarity in the size distributions ensured that robust comparisons about the relative mass concentrations of aerosols generated by speaking and singing at the same loudness could be made.[Figure 4] Measured size distributions for speaking and singing were fitted to bimodal lognormal distributions, consistent with previous studies for speaking, breathing and coughing (Asadi et al. 2019;Johnson et al. 2011;Morawska et al. 2009).

        <p>The consequences of different size distributions are apparent when aerosol mass concentration is reported (Figure 2b, see Tables 1 andS1). This comparison is most important when considering the potential of the different activities to transmit infection. Speaking and singing generated statistically significant differences in mass concentrations of aerosol at similar level of loudness; however, these were modest (median singing values only a factor of 1.5-3.4 times larger than speaking) relative to the effects of the loudness of vocalization (a factor of 20-30 increase). Converting from a number concentration to a mass concentration for breathing, resulted in the mass concentration range shifting to A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t lower values relative to speaking and singing, a consequence of the different size distributions associated with voicing and breathing (median values 24 and 36 times higher for speaking and singing at the highest loudness, respectively, compared with breathing).The consequences of different size distributions are apparent when aerosol mass concentration is reported (Figure 2b, see Tables 1 andS1).

        <p>This study demonstrates that the assessment of risk associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in large groups due to respirable particles from speaking and singing should consider the number and mass concentrations of particles generated by these activities. The statistically significant, yet relatively modest differences detected between the type of vocalization at the loudest volume studied, were eclipsed by the effects of loudness on aerosol production, which varied by more than an order of magnitude from the quietest to loudest volume studied, whether speaking or singing. By contrast, the number of particles produced by breathing covered a wide range (spanning from quiet to loud speaking and singing) but has a size distribution shifted to smaller particle sizes, in principle mitigating some of the potential risk associated with the wider emission range. The results of this study are in agreement with that from Alsved et al., who studied the aerosol concentration generated from a cohort of twelve singers when they individually spoke or sang at two levels of sound pressure (Alsved et al. 2020).This study demonstrates that the assessment of risk associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in large groups due to respirable particles from speaking and singing should consider the number and mass concentrations of particles generated by these activities.

        <p>Singing was shown to generate a greater particle concentration than speaking at an equivalent sound pressure, but the increase in sound pressure showed a large increase in particle production for both types of vocalization.

        <p>We also found that a minority of participants emitted substantially more aerosols than others, sometimes more than an order of magnitude above the median, consistent with the long-tail of a lognormal distribution when viewed in linear-concentration space. This observation is consistent with a previous study (Asadi et al. 2019). However, the highest emitters were not consistently the highest across all activities, suggesting the magnitude of emission from an individual may be highly activity specific. It is unclear why some participants emitted substantially more than others, and further studies are required to better characterize the variability of aerosol emission across the population, as well as the consistency of emission from an individual over time.We also found that a minority of participants emitted substantially more aerosols than others, sometimes more than an order of magnitude above the median, consistent with the long-tail of a lognormal distribution when viewed in linear-concentration space.

        <p>These conclusions have important policy implications in the context of creating guidelines to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Breathing produces smaller particles than singing and speaking, suggesting that vocalization may carry higher risk than breathing if the potential SARS-CoV-2 dose delivered by an individual infected with the virus scales with particle mass. Size distributions are comparable across speaking and singing at the same loudness and generate relatively similar, yet statistically significantly different, numbers of particles. Most importantly, number concentrations from speaking and singing rise in parallel with increasing loudness. Given that speaking and singing produce numbers of particles of the same order of magnitude, and that increasing loudness increases that number by orders of magnitude, guidelines from public health bodies should focus on the loudness at which the vocalization occurs, the number of potentially infectious participants (source strength), the environment (ventilation) in which the activity occurs and the duration of the rehearsal and period over which performers are vocalizing (Charlotte 2020;Miller et al. 2020). For certain vocal activities and venues, amplification may be a practical solution to reduce the loudness of singing by the performers.These conclusions have important policy implications in the context of creating guidelines to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

        <p>Based on the differences observed between vocalization and breathing and given that it is likely that there will be many more audience members than performers, singers may not be responsible for the greatest production of aerosol during a performance, and for indoor events measures to ensure adequate ventilation may be more important than restricting a specific activity. 2a (in cm -3 ), and mass concentration correspond to the series of expiratory activities plotted in Figure 2b (in μg•m -3 ).Based on the differences observed between vocalization and breathing and given that it is likely that there will be many more audience members than performers, singers may not be responsible for the greatest production of aerosol during a performance, and for indoor events measures to ensure adequate ventilation may be more important than restricting a specific activity. 2a (in cm -3 ), and mass concentration correspond to the series of expiratory activities plotted in Figure 2b (in μg•m -3 ).</p>
