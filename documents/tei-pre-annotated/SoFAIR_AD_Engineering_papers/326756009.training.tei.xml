        <p>Purpose: To address the challenges regarding the concept of Industry 4.0 and the diversification methodology and based on the strategic guidance towards Industry 4.0, we propose a process model as a guiding framework for Industry 4.0 collaborative diversification vision, strategy and action building. In this paper we suggest a stage process model to guide and train companies to identify new opportunities for diversification within Industry 4.0. Systematically carrying out the stages will take a company to their individual specific vision and collaborative vision between different companies in the Industry 4.0 scenario. Design/methodology/approach: This new collaborative diversification methodology involves industry within the pilot program; from the diversification and capacity assessment analysis of the company`s profile, skills and technologies that dominates, to identify the diversification opportunity map and its business modeling within the Industry 4.0 paradigm.Purpose: To address the challenges regarding the concept of Industry 4.0 and the diversification methodology and based on the strategic guidance towards Industry 4.0, we propose a process model as a guiding framework for Industry 4.0 collaborative diversification vision, strategy and action building.

        <p>Due to the rapid development of the global economy, many companies choose diversification as their strategic choice (Song &amp; Wang, 2011) in addition to the incorporation of new economic activities, has become an essential fact to become or remain a dynamic company and future. Therefore, diversification has caught the attention of the business world, as well as numerous researchers from different areas in recent decades, seeking to identify the factors that affect it, and demonstrate its effects on business performance.Due to the rapid development of the global economy, many companies choose diversification as their strategic choice (Song &amp; Wang, 2011) in addition to the incorporation of new economic activities, has become an essential fact to become or remain a dynamic company and future.

        <p>There are several ways the company can diversify, either because the new business you want to enter is related or unrelated to the sector which is currently the company, or because they are in different geographical areas, or according to the input mode, either by internal development, acquisition or strategic alliances (Chiang, 2010). Specifically, the strategy of diversification in this project is a related strategy with the new business to which the company wants to enter. For this purpose the existence of overlaps between the two value chains will be key to facilitate and lead the process of diversification.There are several ways the company can diversify, either because the new business you want to enter is related or unrelated to the sector which is currently the company, or because they are in different geographical areas, or according to the input mode, either by internal development, acquisition or strategic alliances (Chiang, 2010).

        <p>The study of the diversification strategy is an important topic in studies on competitiveness, since it has been shown that their choice is critical for the success of this strategy. Some of these studies surrounding this election with barriers to entry, location, or the cultural effects involving the process of sinking into new businesses.The study of the diversification strategy is an important topic in studies on competitiveness, since it has been shown that their choice is critical for the success of this strategy.

        <p>Overall, diversification involves the participation of the same company in different businesses. Therefore, a company decides to expand its business lines into related or different sectors, called diversified company, while those who choose to keep their operations in one segment is known as specialized company.Overall, diversification involves the participation of the same company in different businesses.

        <p>The diversification strategy can be described by the degree of participation in different businesses and the underlying pattern of relations between the various business enterprises. Already in more recent studies Lichtenthaler (2005), define diversification as the "Increasing in products and markets within a company" while others such as Lin and Su (2008) define it as a means by which a company expands from its field in other markets products or services. Martinez and Fernandez (2009) describe as a "Growth of a company through the entry into new lines of business" and Andrés-Alonso and Fuente-Herrero (2004) diversification like a source of growth options.The diversification strategy can be described by the degree of participation in different businesses and the underlying pattern of relations between the various business enterprises.

        <p>In summary we can confirm that the strategy of diversification means when a company decides to expand its line of business, with new products in new markets, which is also known as product diversification, and that when these markets are external geographically, is refers to an international, global, or geographic diversification.In summary we can confirm that the strategy of diversification means when a company decides to expand its line of business, with new products in new markets, which is also known as product diversification, and that when these markets are external geographically, is refers to an international, global, or geographic diversification.</p>

        <p>Europe´s industry is facing substantial economic challenges due to an increasing pace of societal and technological development, such as a decreasing availability of natural resources, increasing energy prices, increasing age of employees and globalization of markets. Moreover, customer increasingly demand for improved product-service innovation, product variety, quality standards, support services and immediacy of satisfaction.Europe´s industry is facing substantial economic challenges due to an increasing pace of societal and technological development, such as a decreasing availability of natural resources, increasing energy prices, increasing age of employees and globalization of markets.

        <p>These challenges need industrial enterprises that are capable of managing their whole value-chain in an agile and responsive manner. Companies need virtual and physical structures that allow for close cooperation and rapid adaption along the whole lifecycle from innovation to production and distribution (Walters &amp; Rainbird, 2007).These challenges need industrial enterprises that are capable of managing their whole value-chain in an agile and responsive manner.

        <p>Many companies, therefore, realize that a more holistic approach towards the management of diversification and growth is needed, but in most SMEs, the preconditions needed for a systematic diversification process do not exist (awareness, knowledge, process, techniques, tools, etc.). Therefore, this contribution describes a systematic approach towards the identification of new diversification opportunities.Many companies, therefore, realize that a more holistic approach towards the management of diversification and growth is needed, but in most SMEs, the preconditions needed for a systematic diversification process do not exist (awareness, knowledge, process, techniques, tools, etc.).
