        <p>Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is a crucial and widely recognised technology designed to capture renewables and recover industrial waste heat helping to balance energy demand and supply on a daily, weekly or even seasonal basis in thermal energy systems [4]. Adopting TES technology not only can store the excess heat alleviating or even eliminating the thermal power fluctuations but also mitigate the mismatching in time and location between the energy supply and corresponding demand from consumers [5]. TES technologies can be classified into three categories including Sensible Thermal Energy Storage (STES), Latent Thermal Energy Storage (LTES) and Thermo-Chemical (Sorption) Energy Storage (TCS) as shown in Fig. 1.Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is a crucial and widely recognised technology designed to capture renewables and recover industrial waste heat helping to balance energy demand and supply on a daily, weekly or even seasonal basis in thermal energy systems [4].

        <p>A general definition of medium-high temperature PCMs is the materials with a phase change temperature (PCT) over 100 • C [16,17]. The density and latent heat of PCMs determine the energy storage density during the phase change process. Other than the energy storage density, the candidate PCM also significantly depends on the melting temperature, thermochemical stability, corrosion to the container, as well as the cost [12]. To achieve an improved match with LTES systems and objective applications, PCMs should meet a series of requirements, as shown in Fig. 3.A general definition of medium-high temperature PCMs is the materials with a phase change temperature (PCT) over 100 • C [16,17].

        <p>As is shown in Table 2 and Table 3, it can be seen that many salts and salt compositions, with a melting temperature in the range of 150-400 • C, are quite suitable to be used in heat recovery technologies [12,37]. Among all the salts and salt compositions, NaNO 3 , KNO 3 and their compositions have been extensively used in solar power plants due to their proper melting temperature and relatively high latent heat [38,39]. From the design perspective, low working temperature is desirable to reduce the operational and maintenance costs of the system. Recently, lithium salts have received increasing attention due to their low melting temperature, low density and high latent heat [40]. Lithium salts have been added and mixed with other salts to form salt compositions used in solar power plants. As the results presented in Fig. 5, the benefits of lithium salt additives can reduce the melting temperature, expand the working temperature and improve thermal stability compared with a commercial salt composition (34KNO 3 -66NaNO 3 ).As is shown in Table 2 and Table 3, it can be seen that many salts and salt compositions, with a melting temperature in the range of 150-400 • C, are quite suitable to be used in heat recovery technologies [12,37].

        <p>Although Birchena et al. [32,45] conducted early studies to explore the potential application of metals and alloys as PCMs for energy storage, metallic materials have not been extensively considered as PCMs in real-world heat recovery applications. Because these materials possess high density and low specific latent heat per mass unit, they are not suitable for the application under weight-sensitive conditions [46]. More recently, some preliminary studies were conducted to investigate the thermal properties and heat transfer performance of aluminiumbased and magnesium-based alloys [47][48][49][50][51], which demonstrated the advantages of the metallic materials with low melting temperature metals over the conventional salts, as well as demonstrating their promising applications in solar power plants, steam generation systems and industrial processes.

        <p>Porous media should have the characteristic of high thermal conductivity to efficiently enhance the PCM thermal conductivity, as well as high porosity to maintain enough PCM filling ratio and high energy storage density [4]. The commonly used porous media mainly includes metal foam and expanded graphite (graphite foam).

        <p>It can be concluded from Table 5 that porous materials can potentially improve the thermal conductivity of PCM. However, it is worth noting that both metal foam and expanded graphite reduced the natural convection of liquid PCM during the charging process, and the adverse effect is not observed during the discharging process. For instance, Zhang et al. [58] demonstrated that the natural convection was weakened in the liquid molten-salt with metal foam, while the discharging process was enhanced due to the presence of the metal foam. Zhu et al. [59] obtained similar results that the increase of PPI (pore per inch) of metal foam could suppress the convective heat transfer so that reduce the energy storage performance of the composite PCM. Attention should be paid to the mass/volume fraction in order to balance the trade-off between the thermal conductivity enhancement and natural convection reduction. According to the above discussion and results summarised in Table 5, it can be demonstrated that the melting/solidification process of LTES system can be significantly enhanced with the porous materials. Nevertheless, in this technique, the geometric parameters and mass/volume fraction, which have a significant influence on the performance of LTES systems, should be important considerations. Finally, the elaboration method to prepare composite of PCM and porous material should be a focus of future studies, since PCM composites obtained by different elaboration routes may quite differ in thermal conductivity enhancement.It can be concluded from Table 5 that porous materials can potentially improve the thermal conductivity of PCM.

        <p>Carbon nanomaterials are the most commonly used nanoparticle additives as they have high thermal conductivity, stable chemical nature, extensive usability and low density [25]. Carbon nanomaterials mainly include multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT), graphite and graphene as shown in Fig. 7. The mass fraction has significant effects on the thermal properties of the formed PCM composites. As a study conducted by Tao et al. [71] showed, the specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of PCM composites first increased and then decreased with the mass fraction of carbon nanomaterials rising. Except for carbon nanomaterials, the metal nanoparticles and metal oxide nanoparticles are also used as additives to enhance the thermal conductivity of PCM [72,73]. Metal-based materials possess quite high thermal conductivity as stated previously which is beneficial for thermal conductivity enhancement. However, metal-based materials are not commonly used for medium-high temperature PCM due to their active chemical nature, causing them to be highly reactive with base PCM at high temperatures [25]. Additionally, most of the metal particles and metal oxide particles have a high density, which further restricts their applications.Carbon nanomaterials are the most commonly used nanoparticle additives as they have high thermal conductivity, stable chemical nature, extensive usability and low density [25].

        <p>Except for the thermal conductivity, latent heat is also a crucial thermophysical parameter determining the thermal energy storage performance. Therefore, when adding nanoparticles into the basic PCM, attention should also be paid on the variation of latent heat. In mediumlow temperature PCMs, Babapoor and Karimi [74] pointed out that the addition of nanoparticles tended to undesirably reduce the latent. In contract, Rufuss et al. [75] demonstrated by adding copper oxide and titanium oxide into the paraffin improved the latent heat by 15.7% and 64.7% compared with that of the basic paraffin. The reason may be attributed to mechanisms including the effects of nanoparticle concentration, surface charge states of nanoparticles, layering in the solid and liquid interface and the movement of phonons [76]. As for the mediumhigh temperature PCMs discussed in this review, Zhang et al. [77] demonstrated that the addition of graphene nanosheet into Li 2 CO 3 -Na 2 CO 3 -K 2 CO 3 decreased the latent heat of basic PCM from 247.1 J/g to 195.6 J/g. Han et al. [78] characterized the thermal properties of composite PCM after adding Al 2 O 3 , CuO and ZnO into MgCl 2 -KCl-NaCl with the same concentration of 0.7 wt%, respectively. The results indicated that the latent heat of basic salt was decreased by 2.4%, 6.4 and 7.6% while the addition of Al 2 O 3 achieved a much higher improvement of thermal conductivity compared with CuO, and ZnO. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the variation of latent heat when adding nanoparticle additives into the base PCMs to enhance the thermal conductivity, since the existing of nanoparticles may lead to either a reduction or improvement of the latent heat, which depends on the types of nanomaterials, concentrations of nanomaterials as well as the melting-solidification process.Except for the thermal conductivity, latent heat is also a crucial thermophysical parameter determining the thermal energy storage performance.

[75] demonstrated by adding copper oxide and titanium oxide into the paraffin improved the latent heat by 15.7% and 64.7% compared with that of the basic paraffin. The reason may be attributed to mechanisms including the effects of nanoparticle concentration, surface charge states of nanoparticles, layering in the solid and liquid interface and the movement of phonons [76]. As for the mediumhigh temperature PCMs discussed in this review, Zhang et al. [77] demonstrated that the addition of graphene nanosheet into Li 2 CO 3 -Na 2 CO 3 -K 2 CO 3 decreased the latent heat of basic PCM from 247.1 J/g to 195.6 J/g. Han et al. [78] characterized the thermal properties of composite PCM after adding Al 2 O 3 , CuO and ZnO into MgCl 2 -KCl-NaCl with the same concentration of 0.7 wt%, respectively. The results indicated that the latent heat of basic salt was decreased by 2.4%, 6.4 and 7.6% while the addition of Al 2 O 3 achieved a much higher improvement of thermal conductivity compared with CuO, and ZnO. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the variation of latent heat when adding nanoparticle additives into the base PCMs to enhance the thermal conductivity, since the existing of nanoparticles may lead to either a reduction or improvement of the latent heat, which depends on the types of nanomaterials, concentrations of nanomaterials as well as the melting-solidification process.</p>
        <p>A summary of thermal conductivity enhancement for medium-high temperature PCM with nanomaterial additives is shown in Table 6. It can be concluded that using carbon nanomaterials as additives offers a significant advantage because they possess high thermal conductivity, stable chemical property and low density. The application of carbon nanomaterials should focus on the aspect ratio of different materials since the large aspect ratio of nanomaterials will lead to higher thermal conductivity enhancement. As highlighted, carbon fibres, graphene and carbon nanotubes have a large aspect ratio [25]. The geometrical parameters and mass/volume fraction of nanomaterial also influence the thermal conductivity enhancement, as was investigated by Tao et al. [71]. Also, different preparation and dispersion techniques influence the extent of thermal conductivity enhancement as discovered by Nomura et al. [79]. Meanwhile, the preparation methods may affect the homogeneity of formed composite PCMs. Zhong et al.

[80] to comprehensively analyse the preparation strategies for composite PCMs with nanomaterials. It was concluded that a well-designed preparation method could benefit the rational utilization of nanoparticle additives and reduce adverse environmental footprints released by the production and application of nanomaterial. Therefore, elaboration methods should be carefully identified to achieve the optimal thermal conductivity of the PCM composite adding with nanomaterials.A summary of thermal conductivity enhancement for medium-high temperature PCM with nanomaterial additives is shown in Table 6.

        <p>To achieve the optimal heat transfer performance using fins in LTES system, more attention should focus on the selection and optimisation of geometrical parameters. Wang et al.

Results showed that fin ratio and fin angle were important to accelerate the melting performance while fin thickness has an insignificant effect on the meting process. Elmaazouzi et al.

The simulation results showed, when respectively inserting 10 fins, 30 fins and 50 fins, the total melting time could be reduced by 31%, 56.5% and 65% compared that of the basic case without fins. It can be found that the total melting time decreased with a smaller rate while the fin number increases. Zauner et al. [94] studied the heat transfer performance of a polyethene PCM storage which was designed for a solar-driven jet ejector chiller plant. Results concluded that increasing fin numbers did not further improve heat storage performance. Fins are also employed in the HTF side to enhance the heat transfer rate between the HTF and tube wall. Tao et al. [91] numerically compared the heat transfer performance of a molten salt LTES system using four different HTF tubes in a solar thermal power plant. Results showed that the three enhanced tubes could reduce the melting time by 19.9%, 26.9% and 30.7% for the dimpled tube, cone-finned tube and helically-finned tube, respectively compared to the smooth tube. Elmaazouzi et al.

        <p>From a general point of view and without considering specified applications, several different experimental and numerical studies were conducted to explore the charging-discharging performance and suitable configuration of LTES coupled with a diesel engine [168][169][170][171] based on the same layout (see Fig. 24). Gopal et al. [168] conducted an energy and exergy analysis of a coupled system of LTES and a twocylinder diesel engine under different operating loads. The engine coolant was taken as the heat source with the temperature of 80 • C and the paraffin was used as PCM. Results showed that the energy efficiency of the integrated system varied from 3.19% to 34.15% while the exergy efficiency ranged from 0.25% to 27.41%, which indicated that both the PCM and HTF should have higher working temperatures in order to minimise heat loss. The following two studies conducted by Pandiyarajan et al. [169,170] employed castor oil and paraffin as HTF and PCM, respectively. In this two studies, the charging experiments were conducted under different engine operating conditions including 25%, 50%, 75% and full load, and the exhaust temperature reached about 160 • C, 250 • C, 280 • C and 350 • C, respectively. Results showed that up to 15.2% of fuel could be saved compared with the same setup without the LTES system. These studies also pointed out the significance of selecting proper PCM and HTF to match the heat source temperature, as well as the potential increased efficiency of using a cascaded LTES layout. Based on previous single-LTES system, Chinnapandian et al. [171] continued to study the double-LTES system, in which d-sorbitol and paraffin were used as PCMs and arranged in cascaded layout. The engine working conditions were identical to the above two studies and the temperature of engine exhaust was also set as 160 • C, 250 • C, 280 • C and 350 • C under four different conditions. It was observed, based on experimental results, that the total recovered waste heat of the double-LTES system was improved up to 20% in contrast to the single-LTES system. Prabu and Asokan [172] conducted experimental work based on the same layout and the same engine operating conditions, but the cylindrical capsules were replaced by spherical containers for PCM encapsulation. The polyethene and water were selected as PCM and HTF, respectively. The experimental results showed that recovered heat accounted for about 7% of the total exhaust waste heat. The above studies preliminarily investigated the energy storage performance of LTES taking the engine coolant and exhaust as heat source without considering the specific applications, which demonstrated the feasibility and high efficiency of coupled LTES-engine system. The proposed system prototype is potential to be applied in the future LTES-based heat recovery system. As for specification applications of LTES in engine waste heat recovery, Jungwook Shon et al. [173] proposed an LTES system using xylitol as PCM to recover the waste heat of engine coolant, and the temperature of coolant was set as about 100 • C according to the conventional engine driving conditions. The recovered heat was used to quickly increase the temperature of the engine during the cold-starting process. The results showed that the warm-up time was reduced by 33.7%. In order to mitigate the thermal power fluctuation of exhaust gas, Yu et al. [174] proposed an organic Rankine cycle system integrating with double latent thermal energy storage to recover the waste heat of engine exhaust gas as shown in Fig. 25. In this study, a real temperature profile of engine exhaust was adopted as a heat source at the temperature range of about 200-400 • C. This pioneering work used salt compositions as PCMs, and twelve salt compositions were screened in detail. Results demonstrated that the fluctuation of the engine exhaust heat can be potentially overcome by the proposed solution. Additionally, the effects of LTSE volume and layouts established that ORC can be combined with double LTES delivered 17.2% greater total power output than that of single LTES under the same LTES volume and operational conditions. When the LTES using medium-high temperature PCMs is considered for waste heat recovery of engine exhaust and coolant, the matching of PCM melting temperature and heat source temperature is quite important. Generally, the temperature of engine coolant is between 80-100 • C, and the coolant loop is generally pressurized to maintain the coolant in the liquid phase with the antifreeze boiling temperature being just above 120 • C. According to Table 1, some organic PCM with melting temperature lower than 120 • C such as RT 100 (100 • C), Dimethyl fumarate (102 • C) and Oxalic acid (105 • C) can be selected. In addition, there are a large number of organic PCMs and salt hydrates with the melting temperature at the range of 60-100 • C [175,176]. As for the temperature of engine exhaust, it is generally between the 200-800 • C for diesel and gasoline engines shown in Fig. 26 [177], therefore, salt and salt composite listed in Table 3 and metallic materials listed in Table 4 can be carefully selected according to the requirements of objective heat recovery systems and cost.From a general point of view and without considering specified applications, several different experimental and numerical studies were conducted to explore the charging-discharging performance and suitable configuration of LTES coupled with a diesel engine [168][169][170][171] based on the same layout (see Fig. 24).

        <p>(1) Medium-high temperature PCMs mainly include some organic compounds, inorganic salt and metallic materials, which possess quite different thermophysical properties. For organic materials, sugar alcohols have a higher melting temperature and latent heat as well as greater supercooling. For pure inorganic salts, they are high in working temperature, thermal stability, and specific heat. The eutectic salts provide additional options to modify the thermophysical properties of pure salts. However, the prediction of thermophysical properties for salt compositions is challenging because of the lack of experimental data. Composites with lithium salts have been emerging as important options since they can reduce the melting temperature, expand the working temperature and promote thermal stability. As for metallic materials, although they have high thermal conductivity and energy storage capacity per volume unit, they have not been widely applied as(1) Medium-high temperature PCMs mainly include some organic compounds, inorganic salt and metallic materials, which possess quite different thermophysical properties.
