        <p>Eubacterium hallii is considered an important microbe in regard to intestinal metabolic balance due to its ability to utilize glucose and the fermentation intermediates acetate and lactate, to form butyrate and hydrogen. Recently, we observed that E. hallii is capable of metabolizing glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA, reuterin) with reported antimicrobial properties. The key enzyme for glycerol to 3-HPA conversion is the cobalamin-dependent glycerol/diol dehydratase PduCDE which also utilizes 1,2propanediol (1,2-PD) to form propionate. Therefore our primary goal was to investigate glycerol to 3-HPA metabolism and 1,2-PD utilization by E. hallii along with its ability to produce cobalamin. We also investigated the relative abundance of E. hallii in stool of adults using 16S rRNA and pduCDE based gene screening to determine the contribution of E. hallii to intestinal propionate formation. We found that E. hallii utilizes glycerol to produce up to 9 mM 3-HPA but did not further metabolize 3-HPA to 1,3-propanediol. Utilization of 1,2-PD in the presence and absence of glucose led to the formation of propanal, propanol and propionate. E. hallii formed cobalamin and was detected in stool of 74% of adults using 16S rRNA gene as marker gene (n = 325). Relative abundance of the E. hallii 16S rRNA gene ranged from 0 to 0.59% with a mean relative abundance of 0.044%. E. hallii PduCDE was detected in 63 to 81% of the metagenomes depending on which subunit was investigated beside other taxons such as Ruminococcus obeum, R. gnavus, Flavonifractor plautii, Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, and Veillonella spp. In conclusion, we identified E. hallii as a common gut microbe with the ability to convert glycerol to 3-HPA, a step that requires the production of cobalamin, and to utilize 1,2-PD to form propionate. Our results along with its ability to use a broad range of substrates point at E. hallii as a key species within the intestinal trophic chain with the potential to highly impact the metabolic balance as well as the gut microbiota/host homeostasis by the formation of different short chain fatty acids.Eubacterium hallii is considered an important microbe in regard to intestinal metabolic balance due to its ability to utilize glucose and the fermentation intermediates acetate and lactate, to form butyrate and hydrogen.

        <p>The mammalian intestine is densely populated by trillions of bacteria belonging to an estimated 500-1,000 species that are predominantly classified as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Under conditions of health, host and microbiota live in a mutualistic relationship. The host supplies energy sources through ingestion of food and secretion of metabolites from the epithelium, and the key roles of the microbiota are the breakdown of nutrients such as dietary and host derived glycans, the synthesis of hormones and vitamins, and colonization resistance to pathogens (Chassard and Lacroix, 2013;Lee and Hase, 2014). Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as butyrate, acetate and propionate, formed during microbial fermentation of dietary or host derived carbohydrates, supply the host with energy but also mediate interactions with the immune system (Louis et al., 2014).The mammalian intestine is densely populated by trillions of bacteria belonging to an estimated 500-1,000 species that are predominantly classified as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.

        <p>Trophic interactions of microbes are required for glycan degradation and fermentation. Complex carbohydrates derived from diet or host (mucins) are degraded by fibrinolytic or mucinolytic bacteria, further metabolism of the hexoses and pentoses yields acetate, propionate, butyrate, formate, succinate, and lactate (Chassard and Lacroix, 2013;Louis et al., 2014). Propionate and butyrate are final products of bacterial metabolism that can be taken up by the host. Succinate can be further metabolized (for e.g., by Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens) to form propionate. Formate is a substrate for methanogenic archaea. Lactate can be used by many species. For example Veillonella forms mainly acetate and propionate from lactate. Members of the Lachnospiraceae such as Eubacterium hallii and Anaerostipes spp. utilize acetate and lactate to produce butyrate and also hydrogen (Duncan et al., 2004).Trophic interactions of microbes are required for glycan degradation and fermentation.

        <p>Due to its ability to utilize the intermediate lactate, E. hallii is considered an important microbe in regard to intestinal metabolic balance as lactate accumulation has been associated with several intestinal diseases and malabsorption (Hove et al., 1994;Duncan et al., 2004). However, the substrate utilization spectrum is not limited to lactate and acetate, as E. hallii also forms butyrate from glucose (Duncan et al., 2004), but does not grow on or utilize more complex oligo-and polysaccharides (Scott et al., 2014).Due to its ability to utilize the intermediate lactate, E. hallii is considered an important microbe in regard to intestinal metabolic balance as lactate accumulation has been associated with several intestinal diseases and malabsorption (Hove et al., 1994;Duncan et al., 2004).

        <p>Recently, we observed that E. hallii is capable of metabolizing glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) which in aqueous solution exists in a multi-compound system called reuterin (Engels et al., 2016). Reuterin has antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and yeast, probably by causing oxidative stress through interaction with intracellular glutathione (Schaefer et al., 2010;Vollenweider et al., 2010). Reuterin formation has previously been reported for members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus (Vollenweider and Lacroix, 2004). The key enzyme that catalyzes glycerol to 3-HPA conversion is the glycerol/diol dehydratase PduCDE (Morita et al., 2008). A second substrate of this enzyme is 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD) which can be further metabolized to propanol or propionate thereby generating one ATP (Gänzle, 2015; Figure 1). Glycerol/diol dehydratases are cobalamin (vitamin B12)-dependent enzymes. In Lactobacillus reuteri, a cluster of 58 genes is involved in the biosynthesis of reuterin and cobalamin (Morita et al., 2008). The pdu operon harbors genes encoding for the glycerol/diol dehydratase as well as enzymes which enable the formation of propionate if 1,2-PD is present as substrate; genes required for cobalamin synthesis are located within the cbi-cob-hem operon (Santos et al., 2008). We observed that E. hallii harbored an almost complete pdu and cob loci, however, in comparison to L. reuteri, gene synteny of the pdu-cbi-cob-hem cluster was not preserved (Engels et al., 2016; Supplementary Figure S1). E. hallii thus possesses the genomic potential to metabolize glycerol and 1,2-PD, and to synthesize cobalamin, however, phenotypic confirmation is missing.Recently, we observed that E. hallii is capable of metabolizing glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) which in aqueous solution exists in a multi-compound system called reuterin (Engels et al., 2016).

        <p>Glycerol and 1,2-PD are readily available in the gastrointestinal tract as they are derived from the metabolism of triglycerides, or fucose and rhamnose, respectively. Latter are building blocks of dietary (for e.g., human milk oligosaccharides) or host derived glycans (mucin; Podolsky, 1985;Casas and Dobrogosz, 2000). The ability of E. hallii to metabolize glycerol and 1,2-PD could result in a competitive advantage by the formation of the antimicrobial compound reuterin or the production of propionate, respectively. Therefore, our primary goal was to investigate the glycerol and 1,2-PD metabolism of E. hallii. We also investigated the relative abundance of E. hallii in adult stool samples derived from the human genome project (HMP, Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012) using 16S rRNA and pduCDE gene screening to determine the contribution of E. hallii to intestinal propionate formation.Glycerol and 1,2-PD are readily available in the gastrointestinal tract as they are derived from the metabolism of triglycerides, or fucose and rhamnose, respectively.

            <rs type="software">DIAMOND</rs> (Buchfink et al., 2015). Sequences that were successfully aligned in the previous step were extracted and realigned against the RefSeq database (Pruitt et al., 2007) using 
            <rs type="software">DIAMOND</rs>. The bit score of alignments of paired reads that mapped to the same reference sequence were boosted by 30%. Reads with the best scoring alignment to PduC, PduD or PduE of E. hallii or L. reuteri were included in analysis.
        </p>
        <p>Ten datasets with in particular high (SRS017521, SRS011271, SRS018427, SRS050422, SRS015431) or low abundance (SRS048164, SRS013800, SRS019787, SRS016018, SRS016585) of E. hallii underwent a deeper metagenomic analysis. The full datasets were aligned against the RefSeq database using 
            <rs type="software">DIAMOND</rs>. Alignment scores were boosted if mate pairs aligned to the same reference. Results were then taxonomically classified using MEGAN's lowest common ancestor algorithm in combination with the NCBI taxonomy (Huson et al., 2011). Functional classification was performed by extracting the best scoring alignment of each read and mapping it to the GI protein names.

        <p>We used two E. hallii isolates that are currently available from public culture collections which were both isolated from human stool samples: the type strain E. hallii DSM 3353 and the E. halliilike isolate DSM 17630 (L2-7, Duncan et al., 2004). Both strains were grown in mYCFA medium containing various combinations of glucose, lactate, glycerol, and 1,2-PD (Table 1, Supplementary Table S1).We used two E. hallii isolates that are currently available from public culture collections which were both isolated from human stool samples: the type strain E. hallii DSM 3353 and the E. halliilike isolate DSM 17630 (L2-7, Duncan et al., 2004).

        <p>Eubacterium hallii reached highest OD (&gt;1.5) when grown in the presence of glucose. E. hallii DSM 3353 and DSM 17630 used 32.8 ± 9 and 21.3 ± 5.1 mM of glucose supplied while producing equimolar amounts of butyrate (Supplementary Table S2, Figures 2A,B and3A,B). When glycerol was added (mYCFA_glc_gly), growth of E. hallii was reduced and reached a maximum OD 600 of about 0.7; little amounts of butyrate (&lt;4 mM) were formed.Eubacterium hallii reached highest OD (&gt;1.5) when grown in the presence of glucose.

When glycerol was added (mYCFA_glc_gly), growth of E. hallii was reduced and reached a maximum OD 600 of about 0.7; little amounts of butyrate (&lt;4 mM) were formed.</p>
        <p>Eubacterium hallii DSM 3353 and DSM 17630 were also grown in the presence of lactate (mYCFA_lac), and of both lactate and glycerol (mYCFA_lac_gly). In mYCFA_lac, the lag phase was extended and the final OD 600 of E. hallii was lower than in mYCFA_glc (Figures 2A and3A). The molar amount of butyrate produced was approximately half of the molar sum of lactate and acetate utilized (Supplementary Table S3). All lactate was utilized within 12 and 24 h of fermentation of E. hallii DSM 3353 and 17630, respectively, (Supplementary Table S3). The addition of glycerol to mYCFA containing lactate (mYCFA_lac_gly) also inhibited growth, lactate and acetate consumption (Figures 2A and3A, Supplementary Table S3).Eubacterium hallii DSM 3353 and DSM 17630 were also grown in the presence of lactate (mYCFA_lac), and of both lactate and glycerol (mYCFA_lac_gly).

        <p>When only glycerol was supplied instead of glucose (mYCFA_gly), E. hallii DSM 3353 did not grow while the OD 600 of DSM 17630 increased by 0.35 units within 3 h of incubation (Figures 2A and3A). The amount of butyrate produced was less than 3 mM for both strains and acetate was not utilized (Figures 2B and3B, Supplementary Table S3). Glycerol was converted to 3-HPA in all samples containing glycerol (Figures 2C,D and3C,D), irrespective of any other carbon sources present. Maximum 3-HPA concentrations were obtained after 6 h of incubation corresponding to 7 and 9 mM for E. hallii DSM 3353 and DSM 17630, respectively. Thereafter, the concentration of 3-HPA decreased steadily to undetectable levels. 1,3-PD was either not detected or present only at very low concentration of less than 1 mM throughout the incubations (data not shown). The reference compound for 3-hydroxypropionate, the alternative end product for glycerol metabolism (Figure 1; Gänzle, 2015) eluated as two peaks. As after growth of E. hallii in the presence of glycerol, no peaks at the rention times of the 3-hydroxypropionate standard appeared, it was assumed that 3-hydroxypropionate was not formed.When only glycerol was supplied instead of glucose (mYCFA_gly), E. hallii DSM 3353 did not grow while the OD 600 of DSM 17630 increased by 0.35 units within 3 h of incubation (Figures 2A and3A).

        <p>We also investigated the growth behavior of E. hallii in the sole presence of 1,2-PD (mYCFA_pd), and in combination with glucose (mYCFA_pd_glc). The presence of 1,2-PD impacted the growth of the two E. hallii strains differently: Growth of E. hallii DSM 3353 was similar in the presence and absence of 1,2-PD while the final optical density of E. hallii DSM 17630 was significantly reduced by the addition of 1,2-PD (Figures 4A and5A). In mYCFA_pd_glc neither strain used glucose, and butyrate was not produced (Figures 4B and5B, Supplementary Table S2).We also investigated the growth behavior of E. hallii in the sole presence of 1,2-PD (mYCFA_pd), and in combination with glucose (mYCFA_pd_glc).

In mYCFA_pd_glc neither strain used glucose, and butyrate was not produced (Figures 4B and5B, Supplementary Table S2).</p>
        <p>In mYCFA_pd, E. hallii DSM 3353 consumed all 1,2-PD within 9 h of incubation (Figures 4C and5C), resulting in the accumulation of propanal, propanol and propionate (Figures 4 and5D-F). The molar yield of propanal, propanol and propionate added up to the molar amount of 1,2-PD used (Figure 6). Slower 1,2-PD utilization was detected when glucose was added (mYCFA_pd_glc) then without (mYCFA_pd). Hereby propanal did not accumulate and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) more propanol was formed by E. hallii DSM 3353 (Figure 4). The utilization of 1,2-PD and corresponding metabolite formation was similar for E. hallii DSM 17630, however, the final amount of propanol produced was not significantly different in the absence or presence of glucose (Figure 5). E. hallii DSM 3353 and DSM 17630 produced about 20 and 10 mM of propionate, respectively, after 24 h of incubation, independently of the presence of glucose (Figures 4E and5E).In mYCFA_pd, E. hallii DSM 3353 consumed all 1,2-PD within 9 h of incubation (Figures 4C and5C), resulting in the accumulation of propanal, propanol and propionate (Figures 4 and5D-F).

        <p>The glycerol/diol dehydratase of L. reuteri is a cobalamindependent enzyme. E. hallii DSM 3353 possesses most of the genes necessary to form cobalamin (Engels et al., 2016; Supplementary Figure S1). To investigate whether E. hallii is able to synthesize cobalamin, a reporter strain assay employing cobalamin-auxotrophic L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM 20355 as indicator strain was conducted. L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis grew after addition of cellular extracts of L. reuteri DSM 20016 and L. rossiae DSM 15814, which were used as positive controls. Addition of cell extracts of both E. hallii strains also resulted in growth of L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis (Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, we could confirm here that both strains of E. hallii are able to form cobalamin.The glycerol/diol dehydratase of L. reuteri is a cobalamindependent enzyme.

        <p>To determine the MIC 50 values of reuterin toward E. hallii, both strains were grown in serial dilutions of reuterin in YCFA medium. OD 600 values measured after 24 h of growth at 37 • C were plotted against corresponding 3-HPA concentrations (Supplementary Figures S3A,B). The inflection points of the resulting curves were used to calculate MIC 50 values. The MIC 50 values of reuterin were determined to be 3.7 ± 0.2 mM (quantified as 3-HPA) for E. hallii DSM 3353 and also for E. hallii DSM 17630. In correspondence with these MIC 50 values, visible growth of both strains was detectable in the presence of up to 7-8 mM 3-HPA (Supplementary Figures S3A,B).To determine the MIC 50 values of reuterin toward E. hallii, both strains were grown in serial dilutions of reuterin in YCFA medium.

        <p>We screened a total of 325 16S rRNA gene libraries obtained from the HMP for the occurrence and relative abundance of E. hallii. Sequences were aligned against the 16S rRNA gene of E. hallii strains DSM 17630 and DSM 3353. Successfully aligned sequences were then aligned against the Silva 16S rRNA database to remove false positives. E. hallii was detected in stool of 74% of the donors. Relative abundance ranged from 0 to 0.59% with a mean relative abundance of 0.044%. Most individuals harbored E. hallii with relative abundance of less than 0.1% (Supplementary Figure S4). We also used pduCDE as functional marker genes to screen 152 metagenomes derived from stool of adults in the scope of the HMP for the presence of E. hallii and L. reuteri. Sequences were aligned against a database that contained PduC, PduD, and PduE from E. halli and L. reuteri using 
            <rs type="software">DIAMOND</rs>. Successfully aligned sequences were then aligned against the RefSeq protein database in order to remove false positives. Depending on which Pdu subunit was investigated, occurrence ranged from 63 to 81% for E. hallii (Table 2). In comparison, L. reuteri was low abundant (0 to 2%) and PduC was only detected in 3 of 152 metagenomes.

        <p>To further investigate to which extent E. hallii contributes to glycerol/1,2-PD metabolism, we determined species contributing glycerol/diol dehydratases using 10 metagenomes with high (MG1-5) or low (MG6-10) abundance of E. hallii PduCDE (Figure 7). In accordance to results obtained by screening for the presence of PduCDE, contribution of E. hallii to the entire glycerol/diol dehydratase pool was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in MG1-5 (23.6 ± 10.6%) than in MG6-10 (2.3 ± 2.4%). However, the relative abundance of all glycerol/diol dehydratases in metagenomes with high (MG1-5) or low (MG6-10) abundance of E. hallii was not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05, log -3.2 ± 0.4 versus -4.7 ± 0.9 relative abundance). In 9 out of 10 metagenomes, E. hallii, Ruminococcus obeum, R. gnavus, Ruminococcus sp. CAG:9, Flavonifractor prautii, Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, and Veillonella spp. contributed more than 59% of all glycerol/diol dehydratases reads while in MG8, all glycerol/diol dehydratases reads were assigned to Escherichia coli (Figure 7). In general, a diverse pool of taxons potentially contributing to glycerol and 1,2-PD metabolism and thus propionate formation was identified.To further investigate to which extent E. hallii contributes to glycerol/1,2-PD metabolism, we determined species contributing glycerol/diol dehydratases using 10 metagenomes with high (MG1-5) or low (MG6-10) abundance of E. hallii PduCDE (Figure 7).

        <p>To investigate the contribution of the three major propionate formation pathways in the human gastrointestinal tract, we screened the previously mentioned 10 metagenomes for the relative abundance of genes encoding methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase Mmda, and lactoyl-CoA dehydratase Ldc, which are key enzymes in succinate and acrylate pathways (Reichardt et al., 2014), and compared to relative abundance of PduCDE of the propanediol pathway. There was no significant difference in relative abundance of key enzymes of the three propionate pathways between metagenomes with high or low abundance of E. hallii. Based on the relative abundance of the key proteins of all three pathways, the propanediol pathway contributed on average 31% to propionate formation, the succinate pathway 64%, and the acrylate pathway 5%.To investigate the contribution of the three major propionate formation pathways in the human gastrointestinal tract, we screened the previously mentioned 10 metagenomes for the relative abundance of genes encoding methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase Mmda, and lactoyl-CoA dehydratase Ldc, which are key enzymes in succinate and acrylate pathways (Reichardt et al., 2014), and compared to relative abundance of PduCDE of the propanediol pathway.

        <p>Previous studies reported high abundance E. hallii in stool of 84 adults from Italy with 5.8, 4.8, and 3.2% in young adults, elderly and centenarians, respectively, determined using HitChip (Biagi et al., 2010). In contrast the stool of 9 out of 10 adults presumably from the UK contained between 0.03 and 2% (mean 0.34%) as determined using FISH (Hold et al., 2003). Relative abundance of E. hallii was 10-100 fold less in libraries derived from HMP. Despite this discrepancy, we observed high occurrence rates of E. hallii. Thus, E. hallii seems a regular constituent of an adult-like gut microbiota.Previous studies reported high abundance E. hallii in stool of 84 adults from Italy with 5.8, 4.8, and 3.2% in young adults, elderly and centenarians, respectively, determined using HitChip (Biagi et al., 2010).

        <p>In contrast to E. hallii, L. reuteri was only rarely detected in adults. The ability to produce reuterin is conserved in strains of L. reuteri isolated from human feces (Frese et al., 2011). However, while being autochthonous in rodents and pigs forming biofilms at the non-glandular stratified squamous epithelium lining the upper gastrointestinal tract, L. reuteri occurs and persists only in the human gastrointestinal tract of some individuals (Walter, 2008), a finding that, we confirmed in this study.In contrast to E. hallii, L. reuteri was only rarely detected in adults.

        <p>When grown in the presence of glucose, both E. hallii strains produced equimolar amounts of butyrate. Molar amount of butyrate produced in mYCFA_lac was approximately half of the molar sum of lactate and acetate utilized; both findings are well in agreement with previous reports (Duncan et al., 2004). Glycerol is an abundant carbon source in the human intestine resulting from incomplete digestion and absorption of triglycerides, from luminal microbial fermentations, digestion of luminal fats, sloughed mucus and desquamated epithelial cells, as well as from intestinal clearing of endogenous plasma glycerol (Casas and Dobrogosz, 2000). According to Degnan et al. (2014a,b) an estimated 11% of gut microbes possess cobalamin-dependent glycerol/diol dehydratases and therefore have the genomic potential to synthesize reuterin from glycerol. The ecological role of reuterin formation remains to be elucidated. In growing cultures of L. reuteri, 3-HPA gets immediately reduced to 1,3-PD by a 1,3-PD dehydrogenase when glycerol and glucose are present to enable co-factor regeneration (Gänzle, 2015; Figure 1). Only during stationary phase in the absence of glucose, 3-HPA gets released from L. reuteri cells and accumulates in the medium (Vollenweider and Lacroix, 2004). For E. hallii, the formation of reuterin was observed whenever glycerol was present. The inconsistency of molar amounts of glycerol used and of 3-HPA detected during growth of E. hallii might be due to degradation of 3-HPA or its binding to proteinaceous compounds present in mYCFA and is well in agreement with previous observations (Luthi-Peng et al., 2002;Engels et al., 2016). Concentrations of about 7-8 mM (quantified as 3-HPA) completely inhibited visual growth and metabolism of the producer strain which is in agreement with growth inhibition observed in MIC 50 assays. MICs of E. hallii were approximately 10-fold less than those observed for L. reuteri (30-50 mM) but were in the range of those reported for other Eubacterium spp. (Cleusix et al., 2007). In contrast to L. reuteri, metabolism of 3-HPA to 1,3-PD was not observed under the test conditions suggesting that E. hallii is not able to regenerate co-factors this way. Therefore glycerol metabolism and reuterin formation does not seem to enhance competitiveness of E. hallii in its ecological niche.When grown in the presence of glucose, both E. hallii strains produced equimolar amounts of butyrate.

        <p>The other possible substrate of glycerol/diol dehydratases is 1,2-PD (Figure 1). 1,2-PD is derived from fermentation of fucose and rhamnose which are transformed by the activity of fucose/rhamnose isomerases, kinases and aldolases finally yielding L-lactaldehyde which can be further reduced to 1,2-PD by the activity of a propanediol oxidoreductase (Boronat and Aguilar, 1981). E. hallii does not harbor genes related to fucose and rhamnose utilization (genome ID: SAMN02415618). However, several gut microbes are capable of forming 1,2-PD (Saxena et al., 2010). Within the draft genome of E. hallii, we could identify homologs of L. reuteri pduQ, pduP, and pduW (Supplementary Figure S1) encoding enzymes which catalyze the transformation of propanal to propanol and propionate. There was, however, no homolog of L. reuteri pduL which presumably encodes the enzyme that transforms propionyl-CoA to propionyl phosphate. Nevertheless, as we observed the formation of propionate, it can be assumed that another enzyme is responsible for the phosphorylation. It can also be suggested that the metabolism of 1,2-PD to propionate increases the competitive advantage of E. hallii as this transformation generates one additional ATP (Gänzle, 2015).The other possible substrate of glycerol/diol dehydratases is 1,2-PD (Figure 1). 1,2-PD is derived from fermentation of fucose and rhamnose which are transformed by the activity of fucose/rhamnose isomerases, kinases and aldolases finally yielding L-lactaldehyde which can be further reduced to 1,2-PD by the activity of a propanediol oxidoreductase (Boronat and Aguilar, 1981).

        <p>Eubacterium hallii formed similar amounts of propionate in the presence or absence of glucose and did not utilize glucose if 1,2-PD was present. In contrast, butyrate formation from lactate only occurred when glucose was depleted (Duncan et al., 2004). In vivo, both pathways can be expected to happen as glucose is generally of low abundance in the colon. Due to its versatile metabolic activity, E. hallii seems to be able to impact the ratios of acetate and lactate and of butyrate and propionate. Both butyrate and propionate are important in gut microbiota/host homeostasis as they interact with the host epithelium and impact the immune system. Butyrate is a main energy source of colonocytes, it impacts cell proliferation and differentiation, and lowers the risk of colitis and colorectal cancer (Wong et al., 2006;Plöger et al., 2012). Propionate acts as a precursor for gluconeogenesis in the liver and also impacts cell differentiation with potential health promoting impact on intestinal inflammation, and cancer development (Reichardt et al., 2014).Eubacterium hallii formed similar amounts of propionate in the presence or absence of glucose and did not utilize glucose if 1,2-PD was present. In contrast, butyrate formation from lactate only occurred when glucose was depleted (Duncan et al., 2004).

        <p>In the intestine, acrylate, propanediol and succinate pathways lead to the production of propionate (Reichardt et al., 2014). The latter has been considered to contribute the most to propionate formation due to the widespread occurrence of the key gene Mmda encoding a methylmalonyl decarboxylase (Reichardt et al., 2014). Also here, the succinate pathway was identified as the most abundant propionate synthesizing pathway based on abundance of Mmda. However, the frequent detection of genes encoding glycerol/diol dehydratases suggests that 1,2-PD conversion contributes significantly to propionate formation, and that E. hallii is a relevant species in regard to intestinal propionate production. Among other species identified as glycerol and 1,2-PD utilizers by the activity of glycerol/diol dehydratases and therefore potential propionate producers were R. obeum and R. gnavus, F. prautii and I. butyriciproducens, and Veillonella spp. R. gnavus is known to utilize mucins and degrades fucosylated glycans to propanol and propionate most likely via the formation of 1,2-PD (Crost et al., 2013). F. prautii and I. butyriciproducens of Clostridium cluster IV do not utilize fucose (Kläring et al., 2013). Roseburia inulivorans which utilizes fucose and degrades it to propionate and propanol (Scott et al., 2006), was not recovered in the screening conducted.In the intestine, acrylate, propanediol and succinate pathways lead to the production of propionate (Reichardt et al., 2014).

        <p>Glycerol/diol dehydratases are cobalamin dependent enzymes, and indeed, E. hallii produces cobalamin. Cobalamin formation is widespread among gut microbes and a variety of enzymes are cobalamin co-factor dependent (Degnan et al., 2014b). Nevertheless, the gut microbiota most likely does not supply cobalamin to the host in sufficient quantities as the main site of cobalamin formation is the colon whereas cobalamin specific receptors are located in the small intestine (Degnan et al., 2014b). Additionally, microbial competition for cobalamin is high, an estimated 80% of species requires cobalamin as co-factor, but only 25% can produce it (Degnan et al., 2014a). Considering this ecological context, E. hallii again gains competitive benefit within the gut microbiota as it is able to form cobalamin.Glycerol/diol dehydratases are cobalamin dependent enzymes, and indeed, E. hallii produces cobalamin.
