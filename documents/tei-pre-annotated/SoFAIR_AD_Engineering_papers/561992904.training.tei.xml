        <p>High entropy alloys (HEAs), offering a multi-dimensional compositional space, provide almost limitless design opportunities surpassing the frontiers of structural materials development.

        <p>Most conventional metals and alloys display a trade-off effect associated with their strength-ductility values, often highlighted by the well-known banana-shaped variation of strength vs. ductility. In other words, strength increment in metallic alloys is often associated with simultaneous reduction in ductility and vice-versa [1][2][3] . In this regard, one of the critical research problems in the area of structural materials is to design materials that successfully evade this inverse strength-ductility relationship [4 , 5] . To achieve this for conventional alloys, the most potent design aspect still pertains to exploiting the local scale compositional and microstructural heterogeneities, wherein different phases or grain orientations display varying elastic stiffness and strain accommodation mechanisms. By appropriate thermo-mechanical processing, a non-homogeneous composite like mechanical response can be triggered such that different regions in the microstructure contribute to strengthening and higher ductility, respectively [5] . However, when considering dilute conventional alloys, where a well-defined solvent matrix is present in addition to low alloying amounts of different solute elements, the possibility to generate significant and diverse phase heterogeneities at multiple length scales becomes quite difficult or rather impossible to achieve.Most conventional metals and alloys display a trade-off effect associated with their strength-ductility values, often highlighted by the well-known banana-shaped variation of strength vs. ductility.

        <p>The last decade has seen emergence of a newly developed class of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) or multicomponent alloys that ideally comprise of equiatomic or near equiatomic proportions of four to five elements, giving rise to a single-phase solid solution [6 , 7] . The concept of achieving a single-phase matrix, despite the absence of well-defined solvent, is based upon the precedence of entropic stabilization over enthalpy contributions of the expected intermetallic phase formations [7] . However, the current state of the art with regards to design of HEAs reveals that the majority of the alloys fabricated exist either as multi-phase or the known single phase compositions decompose over long durations into more than one phases [8 -14] . This is owing to the significant compositional fluctuations and phase reordering during the thermomechanical processing and subsequent room temperature characterization of these alloys [14 -16] .The last decade has seen emergence of a newly developed class of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) or multicomponent alloys that ideally comprise of equiatomic or near equiatomic proportions of four to five elements, giving rise to a single-phase solid solution [6 , 7] .

        <p>The current viewpoint paper, hence, presents the key metal physics behind strengthening and related microstructural design possibilities in HEAs. An insight into the theoretical models of solid solution strengthening in HEAs is briefly discussed, along with emphasis upon the inherent limitations of application of such models for currently existing HEAs, which are far away from random solid solutions. Moreover, the inadequacies with respect to predicting strengthening solely based upon solute induced lattice friction hardening and the need of alternative strengthening contributions is highlighted. The article further critically discusses strengthening aspects in multiphase HEAs and design pathways for structurally advanced HEAs. Finally, a clear advantage of multi-phase HEA nano/microstructures that trigger multi-scale strengthening over single-phase HEAs in terms of overall mechanical response will be justified.The current viewpoint paper, hence, presents the key metal physics behind strengthening and related microstructural design possibilities in HEAs.

        <p>In general, HEAs are supposed to represent random solidsolution alloys with many components [7 , 24] . To a certain extent it is accepted that solid solution hardening is one of the principal causes of the exceptional mechanical properties of HEAs [25] . The high yield strength of some HEAs is mainly related to the solid solution strengthening and interface strengthening effects. In some systems the contributions to yield strength and interface strengthening showed to be equally distributed, i.e. half of its value is due to interface/ grain-boundary strengthening and the other half is caused by solid solution hardening effect.In general, HEAs are supposed to represent random solidsolution alloys with many components [7 , 24] .

        <p>Despite the obvious importance of solid solution to the strengthening of metallic alloys, it is not so obvious how to describe the physical mechanisms behind these phenomena in case of concentrated alloys. A couple of points were clarified recently and a number of critical issues are mentioned in the following [26 -38] . Solid solution strengthening in metallic alloys manifests due to either direct or indirect interactions between solute atoms and dislocations. When an incoming dislocation approaches the vicinity of a solute atom, it gives rise to the following dislocation/solute interactions: Elastic stress field of the solute and dislocation interact as well as the line energy of the dislocation is modified owing to the difference in atomic sizes and shear moduli of the solute and solvent; Contributions from the changing interatomic bonding environments due to presence of solutes inside dislocation core and stacking faults also referred to as 'Suzuki' strengthening effect.Despite the obvious importance of solid solution to the strengthening of metallic alloys, it is not so obvious how to describe the physical mechanisms behind these phenomena in case of concentrated alloys.

        <p>From a classical perspective, the type of obstacles can be broadly divided into categories depending on the range of interactions. Fleischer [39] and Friedel [40] were the first to postulate independently that isolated solutes atoms act as direct pinning agents. In the words of Fred Kocks, Ali Argon and Mike Ashby [41] , "discrete obstacles describe obstacles to slip whose dimensions are limited in both directions in the slip plane (although not necessarily perpendicular to it). The limits of the obstacles do not have to be sharp, they merely must be sharp enough for it to be treated as an individual". Most of the theoretical concepts developed since the 1960s by Jacques Friedel, Robert Fleischer, Frank Nabarro, Reiner Labusch and later by Michael Zaiser [39 , 41 -45] were focused on rather dilute solid solution alloys which is obviously not the case in HEAs and MEAs (Medium Entropy Alloys). Some obstacles may have long-range elastic stress fields, such as the interaction between a dislocation and the stress fields of all the other dislocations or solutes (diffuse obstacles) or interact only locally with the dislocation line (localized obstacles). In contrast to most of the (preliminary) theoretical descriptions in HEAs, in real crystals the dislocation lines are seldom straight and the obstacle will bend nearby parts of the dislocation through a large or small angle against the line tension T, described in the dimensionless Labuschparameter:From a classical perspective, the type of obstacles can be broadly divided into categories depending on the range of interactions.

        <p>where F max denotes the maximum applied force that the obstacle can resist; L obs is the range of interaction and is the mean obstacle spacing in the slip plane . When n 0 &lt; 1, the interaction of the dislocation line with the obstacle takes place over a small segment and the interaction is then considered to be a point force. In that case an effective obstacle strength can be calculated as was first derived by Friedel [40] . In steady state, Friedel statistics assume that a dislocation released at one obstacle must, on average pick up exactly one on another site. However, from a comparison between experimental in-situ pulsed-nuclear magnetic resonance and the values predicted using Friedel statistics, it can be concluded that in each dislocation jump a number of effective solute atoms (several orders of magnitude bigger than unity) is bypassed [46 -48] . These experiments based on spin-lattice relaxation measurements show that fluctuations in the quadrupolar field caused by moving dislocations in alloys are very different from those in ultra-pure metallic systems. We do not intend to summarize all details in this contribution but the basic idea is that dislocations (in cubic systems, like FCC and BCC) have a disturbed cubic symmetry around the core and therefore dislocations possess non-zero components of the (electric) field gradients at the nuclei. In crystals the individual atoms or ions are assumed to have spherical symmetry in a first approximation. Thus the electric field gradients due to their own electron cloud vanish and the electric field gradients at a nucleus in the lattice originate from neighboring atoms. As a consequence through the interactions of the non-zero electric field gradients V i -q around dislocations and the nuclear electric quadrupole moment ˆ Q i q a quadrupole-field Hamiltonian ˆ H Q exists, provided of course that the nuclear spin I &gt; ½ (like Al for FCC, V for BCC) since otherwise the nuclear electric quadrupole moment ˆ Q i q at the nucleus i is equal to zero and ˆ H Q = 0 anyway.where F max denotes the maximum applied force that the obstacle can resist; L obs is the range of interaction and is the mean obstacle spacing in the slip plane .

        <p>In fact ˆ H Q contributes to the spin-lattice relaxes time, i.e. making the relaxation between spin system and lattice reservoir more effective depending on the coupling strength between lattice and spin systems. When dislocations are forced to move in the lattice the quadrupole-field Hamiltonian fluctuates at the nuclei, since the surroundings around the nuclei changes locally when dislocations are passing by. In other words the spin-lattice relaxation rate is affected by moving dislocations due to variations in the effective quadrupole-field Hamiltonian. Therefore by measuring the spinlattice relaxation rate (in the rotating frame 1/ T 1 ρ , usually near magnetic resonance) in-situ, i.e. inside a magnetic field during deformation, as a function of strain rate the mean free path can be measured directly. The fundamental idea here is to correlate the measurable spin-lattice relaxation time to the applied strain rate using the Orowan equation, i.e. to get experimental values of the waiting/run times of mobile dislocations, of mobile dislocation densities and of mean jump distances (for more details reference is made to [46 -48] ).In fact ˆ H Q contributes to the spin-lattice relaxes time, i.e. making the relaxation between spin system and lattice reservoir more effective depending on the coupling strength between lattice and spin systems.

        <p>Both the spin-lattice relaxation data and the data obtained from strain-rate change experiments on several alloy systems indicate that Friedel's approximation of solution hardening is violated and is not applicable, neither in dilute or concentrated HEAs. In fact, only fairly strong obstacles at very low concentrations seem to fall inside the range where Friedel's model is justified. Rather, that physical description seems to work for describing the interaction between moving dislocations and forest dislocations, not for solutes and definitely not for HEA/MEAs.

        <p>The diffuse forces bend the dislocation line into an arc of radius R against the line tension T. The physical picture given by Nabarro underlying the Labusch derivation is that of a mean fluctuation in the sign of the obstacle interaction, positive and negative, whereas in the Friedel picture, all obstacles are repulsive. For rather strong diffuse obstacles, the radii of the arcs into which the dislocation line is bent are of the order of the obstacle spacing, .

        <p>In context with MEAs/HEAs, it is important to reiterate that these models were primarily developed to gauge the solute strengthening response in conventional alloys i.e. for dilute alloys. In that respect, the scenario is expected to be much more complicated when applying the aforementioned approach in the case of highly concentrated alloys such as HEAs, wherein an accurate demarcation between solute and solvent cannot be established anymore. A dislocation pinned at, due to size effects, different obstacles in HEAs may "unzip" along its entire length after thermal activation of only one segment of the dislocation across the barrier, since at that very moment the critical breakaway angle of all other segments might be exceeded.In context with MEAs/HEAs, it is important to reiterate that these models were primarily developed to gauge the solute strengthening response in conventional alloys i.e. for dilute alloys.

        <p>First attempts for a theoretical assessment of solid solution strengthening in single phase HEAs were made by Toda-Caraballo and Rivera-Diaz-del-Castillo [35 , 36] , which was essentially an extension of the Labusch type model for conventional alloys that considers a random distribution of solute atoms as diffuse obstacles for dislocation motion. The misfit in atomic size contribution is calculated by measuring individual interatomic spacing with respect to the mean lattice parameter obtained through averaging all interatomic spacing between like-like and like-unlike elements in the alloy. In the same way, the modulus misfit is measured over a reference value that corresponds to a mean shear modulus for the HEA as obtained from the weighted average of individual shear moduli contributions of each alloying element.First attempts for a theoretical assessment of solid solution strengthening in single phase HEAs were made by Toda-Caraballo and Rivera-Diaz-del-Castillo [35 , 36] , which was essentially an extension of the Labusch type model for conventional alloys that considers a random distribution of solute atoms as diffuse obstacles for dislocation motion.

        <p>Solid solution strengthening mechanisms in random FCC alloys were also theoretically evaluated by Curtin and co-workers, wherein an effective medium-based strengthening model was established [37] . Each element is considered as a solute in a mean field solvent, which is described by the averaged properties of the alloy i.e. lattice spacing, elastic constants and stable and unstable stacking fault energies. In comparison to the model proposed by Toda-Caraballo and Rivera-Diaz-del-Castillo, the effective mediumbased strengthening theory also reintroduced the influence of stress field fluctuations due to the presence of solutes on the dislocation line tension, thereby also considering the effect of mesoscopic stress fluctuations on the solute hardening response. In contrast to the general ideas around HEAs the work leads to the surprising findings that the strength does not directly depend on the number of components, and is not maximized by the equi-atomic composition. In particular, the strongest and most temperature-insensitive materials are achieved by maximizing the concentration-weighted mean-square misfit volume quantity and/or increasing the shear modulus.Solid solution strengthening mechanisms in random FCC alloys were also theoretically evaluated by Curtin and co-workers, wherein an effective medium-based strengthening model was established [37] .

        <p>Despite the fact that the aforementioned theoretical models provide interesting insights on the role of lattice distortion on yield strength increment in HEAs, application of these models to experimentally designed HEAs possesses a major limitation with respect to complete determination of the strengthening response. In particular, the assumption of a random solid solution HEAs in the abovementioned models is practically difficult to achieve owing to the enthalpy driven phase reordering or separation during thermomechanical processing in most HEA microstructures [14] . Such correlated atomic rearrangements invariably lead to strong compositional fluctuations that either display short-range or long-range order, wherein confounding effects of solute clusters/secondary phases adulterate the pure solid solution strengthening response. This notion also obviates the commonly postulated assertion that HEAs or concentrated alloys would ideally be stronger than conventional alloys owing to enhanced solid solution strengthening. Consequently, the impact of such local chemical ordering on dislocation motion becomes a critical aspect that needs to be evaluated and strengthening models purely based upon lattice friction induced hardening would not hold valid for most of the currently existing HEAs.Despite the fact that the aforementioned theoretical models provide interesting insights on the role of lattice distortion on yield strength increment in HEAs, application of these models to experimentally designed HEAs possesses a major limitation with respect to complete determination of the strengthening response.

        <p>In fact this was corroborated by the findings in a recent study by Robert Maaß and collaborators, wherein the peak dislocation velocities in FCC Al 0.3 CoCrFeNi and pure Au did not show much difference, indicating dislocation motion is not significantly sluggish in single phase solid solution HEAs (Rizzardi et al. [49] ). In light of the aforementioned aspects, it becomes necessary to appraise both independent and interdependent effects of crystallographic defect (i.e. both line and planar defects) topology and compositional fluctuations on the local strengthening response.In fact this was corroborated by the findings in a recent study by Robert Maaß and collaborators, wherein the peak dislocation velocities in FCC Al 0.3 CoCrFeNi and pure Au did not show much difference, indicating dislocation motion is not significantly sluggish in single phase solid solution HEAs (Rizzardi et al.

        <p>A detailed analysis of the strain hardening behavior in several of these HEAs indicates that the presence of 'multiple solutes and solvents' does not always greatly affect the dislocation accumulation. It means that strain hardening with increasing number of components is due to an increase of the strength of dislocation/dislocation interaction; i.e. there exists some rearrangement of solutes/solvents correlated with the position of the dislocations which can occur even at ambient temperature that results in an increase in the effective dislocation/dislocation strength. This may result in a multiplicative effect of solutes/solvents on strain hardening (see also [46] ).A detailed analysis of the strain hardening behavior in several of these HEAs indicates that the presence of 'multiple solutes and solvents' does not always greatly affect the dislocation accumulation.

        <p>The multicomponent nature of HEAs leads to significant frustration in the resultant crystal structure. One of the direct outcomes of such complexity in crystal structure is that the characteristics of overall plasticity in HEAs can be quite distinct in comparison with conventional alloys. In particular, the inherent compositional fluctuations in these multicomponent alloys can give rise to local heterogeneities in the microstructures that can span across multiple length scales. Ranging from the influence of local chemical ordering effects, either short-or medium range, at atomic scales to phase interface generation through phase separation mechanisms at sub-micron/ nanoscales, these compositional fluctuations play a definitive role in the overall defect configurations in HEAs i.e. phase/grain boundaries, twin boundaries, dislocations [4 , 14] . Broadly speaking, strengthening and strain hardening in most non-random and multi-phase HEAs find contributions from heterogeneities at the following levels: a) At the first order, the local chemical ordering effects at the atomic-scale significantly alters the ease of dislocation motion as well as the dislocation line energy, wherein mutual interactions between dislocation stress fields that constitute a major component of stage II hardening behavior is modified. b) At the nanometric level, ordered cluster formations and nanosized precipitates that give rise to coherency strain fields and precipitation hardening effects with sizable back stresses on dislocation motion during plasticity c) At a more advanced stage of precipitation, presence of ordered secondary phases or spinodally modulated structures give rise to large density of interphase boundaries and subsequent strengthening contributions in form order hardening, spinodal strengthening etc. d) At larger length scales, sub-micron/micrometer scales, defect structures such as grain boundaries, crystallographically dissimilar phase boundaries, and twin boundaries strongly interact with line defects, and influence the strengthening and plasticity response.The multicomponent nature of HEAs leads to significant frustration in the resultant crystal structure.

        <p>It has been shown previously [50][51][52] In an independent study, Zhang et al. [52] revealed that the exceptional ductility of high entropy alloys in cryogenic temperatures is attributed to negative stacking fault energies whereby profuse generation of stacking faults and nano-twins dictate the plasticity response. Presence of a large density of stacking faults can significantly augment the intra-granular strain hardening response in HEAs due to strong dislocation-stacking fault entanglements and creation of large density of partial dislocations. In addition, the local chemical ordering combined compositional gradients leads to large variation in stacking fault widths inside the same alloy, whereby the dislocation line configuration will be much wavier and complex resulting in hindered mobility. Activation of such mechanisms would invariably augment the generic strain hardening response in comparison with single-phase random solid solution HEAs as well as conventional alloys. Hence altering γ SFE via. compositional tuning through local ordering and clustering provides a great platform to mechanistically design high strength -high ductility HEAs.It has been shown previously [50][51][52] In an independent study, Zhang et al.

        <p>In light of the aforementioned theories, one such potential alloy design pathway employs compositional fluctuations as a means to intrinsically modify γ SFE and trigger additional strain accommodation mechanisms such as deformation twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) phenomenon. Twinning not only contributes to plasticity but also can promote dynamic Hall-Petch driven strengthening behavior, owing to grain fragmentation through twin boundary formation. TWIP effects were observed in a non-equiatomic Fe 40 Mn 40 Co 10 Cr 10 HEA at higher deformation strains, whereby a significant enhancement in the overall strength-ductility response was observed [53] . In recent work [54] it was shown that by modifying the composition of Mn from 50% to 10% in the CoCrFeMnNi cantor alloy, the mechanical response varies from dislocation and slip induced microband dominated deformation for high Mn content (large γ SFE ) to nano-twinning based deformation at low Mn contents (small γ SFE ). While the former contributes to higher work hardening, the latter optimizes hardening with enhanced ductility. It becomes of interest to pursue alloy design strategies that can trigger composition gradients in Mn content such as using diffusion couples, wherein a bimodal deformation scheme combining high hardenability associated micro-banding phenomenon and simultaneous ductility and grain boundary strengthening from nano-twinning is achieved.In light of the aforementioned theories, one such potential alloy design pathway employs compositional fluctuations as a means to intrinsically modify γ SFE and trigger additional strain accommodation mechanisms such as deformation twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) phenomenon.

A direct consequence of such local elemental heterogeneities manifests as a greater susceptibility of HEAs to undergo dynamic phase transformation under applied temperature or stress, which could serve as potent mechanism to trigger interesting plasticity mechanisms as well as accommodate larger strains. Li et al. demonstrated for non-equiatomic compositions [11] based on the FCC single phase Cantor alloy, dynamic transformation of FCC to HCP crystal structure during plastic deformation was observed that simultaneously enhanced strength and ductility. Basu et al. [21] reported dynamic indentation induced phase transition from BCC to FCC in Al 0.7 CoCrFeNi HEAs (c.f. Fig. 1 c). The transformation was attributed to the metastability of A2 phases owing to local compositional fluctuations of Al in the spinodally decomposed BCC phase such that under applied stress the A2 phases that were locally depleted in Al content could displacively transform to the more stable and ductile FCC phase.Chemical gradients in HEAs are instrumental in triggering local rearrangements and shuffling of elements thus influencing the stability of the existing phases.

        <p>While spinodal HEAs put greater emphasis towards larger strengthening potential, precipitation hardened HEAs provide greater optimization in terms of beating the strength-ductility trade off or the banana curve effect observed in most metallic alloys. For instance, when considering the other spectrum of Al x CoCrFeNi alloys that is known to crystallize as single phase FCC, with low Al content ( x ≤ 0.3), it has been shown that the primary strengthening contribution is attributed to the presence of extremely fine (~5 nm) ordered L1 2 -Ni 3 Al precipitates in the aged condition that are fully coherent with the ductile FCC matrix [61 , 62] . The subsequent shearing of these precipitates gives rise to simultaneous precipitation hardening and order hardening effects.

The findings clearly show the beneficial impact of dual-phase HEAs over single-phase microstructures in terms of concurrent strength-ductility increment. On similar lines, it has been seen that the addition of simultaneous addition of Al and Ti to single phase FCC CoCrFeNi HEAs can also trigger precipitation hardening effects due to presence of ordered FCC precipitates, giving rise to a strengthening potential between 0.3 and 0.4 GPa [22] .

        <p>Digressing from crystallographically similar interphases, the role of interfaces between phases crystallizing into different crystal structures could also be harnessed for activating simultaneous strength and plasticity increment. In particular, the role of dislocation-phase boundary interaction in conjunction with compositional gradients on local mechanical response needs to be addressed. The metal physics of strengthening across phase boundaries is distinct when compared with classical grain boundaries. While strain transfer across homophase interfaces is primarily governed by the geometrical alignment of incoming and outgoing dislocation slip [65 -67] , the strengthening across heterophase interfaces can be significantly larger as it draws contributions from additional interphase dependent strengthening modes. These alternative strengthening modes are strongly dependent upon the local compositional fluctuations and phase crystallography. Interphase dependent hardening, as has been extensively investigated in metallic multilayers [68] , is known to primarily stem from three misfit effects viz. a) Elastic moduli mismatch ('image' or 'Koehler' stresses, τ K ), where the underlying effect stems from the variation of strain energy per unit length of dislocation with changing modulus. Typically, a dislocation traversing from an elastic stiffer phase into a softer phase will experience an attractive force at the interface that hypothetically equals to the stress from a negative image dislocation positioned on the other side of the interphase boundary; b) Lattice parameter mismatch ('misfit' stresses, τ misfit ) between crystallography dissimilar interfaces leads to the creation of a grid of interfacial dislocations that gives rise to additional coherency strain hardening effects at the interface. While the coherency stresses add up to the dislocation glide stress, they additionally strengthen non-glide stress components of the dislocation stress field by modifying the local core structure; Mechanistically, these independent magnitudes of these strengthening contributions dynamically evolve on the basis of mean distance between the incoming dislocation and the interphase; however as per continuum mechanics wherein the properties can be averaged over a single representative volume element, we can mathematically express the overall strengthening across heterophase interfaces ( τ int ) as a linear sum, τ int = τ HP + τ K + τ misfit + τ ch (5) Where, the first term on the right hand side corresponds to the interphase independent obstacle strength of the grain boundary ( τ HP ). Local scale strengthening response was investigated across BCC/FCC interfaces in Al x CoCrFeNi HEAs based on the above parameters (c.f. lower right inset image in Fig. 2 a) and it was revealed that the interfacial strengthening values across heterophase interfaces in HEAs ( τ int ~4 GPa) was nearly 4 times larger than the ones observed in the case of conventional BCC/FCC interfaces [20] .

The following key takeaways and recommendations are proposed:The present viewpoint paper emphasizes on harnessing the local fluctuations in chemical composition in HEAs on the spatial configurations of crystallographic defects to trigger simultaneously diverse strengthening effects that would typically be difficult to achieve in dilute/conventional alloys.

        <p>Solute strengthening in HEAs is largely predicted based on random atomic arrangement, wherein the lattice friction effect is the sole criteria for strengthening of dislocation motion. However, experimental single-phase HEA microstructures largely deviate from such assumption in terms of compositional heterogeneities inherent to these alloys. Greater efforts are needed to appraise such chemically driven ordering and their corresponding influence on roughening dislocation dynamics. Noteworthy are the attempts already been made by Zhang et al. [71] in this direction, wherein they recently introduced a stochastic Peierls-Nabarro (PN) model that considers the role of short range ordering effect as well.Solute strengthening in HEAs is largely predicted based on random atomic arrangement, wherein the lattice friction effect is the sole criteria for strengthening of dislocation motion.

        <p>1) When juxtaposing single-phase HEAs against dual/multi-phase HEAs in light of mechanical response, the superiority of the latter is clearly visible. This is owing to the additional room for tailoring multiscale defect/phase heterogeneities in multi-phase HEAs stemming from aggravating local chemical gradients. 2) Multi-phase HEAs provide opportunities for structural application oriented design. Spinodally modulated structures are critical for augmenting strengthening, especially in case of refractory applications. On the other hand, ordered precipitation hardening pathway provides greater synergy between strength and ductility. On mesoscopic scales, creation of crystallographically dissimilar interphase boundaries can be utilized to activate interfacial strengthening mechanisms. 3) Novel design schemes involving hierarchical microstructures with simultaneous compositional fluctuation, grain size and defect topology gradients can be employed to promote multiscale strengthening in new generation HEAs. Fig. 3 illustrates a schematic of such model hierarchical structures utilizing compositional gradients.1) When juxtaposing single-phase HEAs against dual/multi-phase HEAs in light of mechanical response, the superiority of the latter is clearly visible.

        <p>Finally, the current viewpoint beckons upon a greater emphasis on metal physics based microstructural engineering in multicomponent alloys rather than solely focusing upon exploration of new compositions that seems to be a limitless pursuit.Finally, the current viewpoint beckons upon a greater emphasis on metal physics based microstructural engineering in multicomponent alloys rather than solely focusing upon exploration of new compositions that seems to be a limitless pursuit.</p>
