        <p>The isogeometric analysis associated with a novel quasi-3D shear deformation theory is proposed to investigate size-dependent behaviours of functionally graded microplates. The modified couple stress theory with only one material length scale parameter is employed to effectively capture the size-dependent effects within the microplates. Meanwhile, the quasi-3D theory which is constructed from a novel seventh-order shear deformation refined plate theory with four unknowns is able to consider both shear deformations and thickness stretching effect without requiring shear correction factors. The NURBS-based isogeometric analysis is integrated to exactly describe the geometry and approximately calculate the unknown fields with higher-order derivative and continuity requirements. The proposed approach is successfully applied to study the static bending, free vibration and buckling responses of rectangular and circular functionally graded microplates with various types of boundary conditions in which some benchmark numerical examples are presented. A number of investigations are also conducted to illustrate the effects of the material length scale, material index, and aspect ratios on the responses of the microplates.The isogeometric analysis associated with a novel quasi-3D shear deformation theory is proposed to investigate size-dependent behaviours of functionally graded microplates.

        <p>Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are composite materials formed of two or more constituent phases in which material properties vary smoothly within the structure. Consequently, FGMs avoid high interlaminar shear stresses, stress concentration and delamination phenomena which are often cited as shortcomings of laminated composite materials. A FGM consisting of ceramic and metal possesses higher thermal resistance and better ductility which are inherited from the ceramic and metal phases, respectively. Owing to these striking features, FGMs are applicable to various fields of engineering including aerospace, nuclear power, chemistry and bio-engineering. FGMs have also been widely studied for various types of structures such as beams [1][2][3][4], plates [5][6][7][8], and shells [9][10][11].Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are composite materials formed of two or more constituent phases in which material properties vary smoothly within the structure.

        <p>Recent advances in technology lead to new industrial fields in which small-scale elements are involved. Such elements have been applied in micro-and nano-electro-mechanical systems [12,13], actuators [14], space and bio-engineering [15]. These applications encourage new research area that focuses on investigating and predicting the behaviours of such micro structures. A number of approaches have been employed to analyse the characteristics of small-scale structures both experimentally and numerically [16,17]. Indeed, typical structural sizes range from a few to dozens of polycrystalline grains only, such that the actual local grain morphology has a strong influence on the global structural behaviour [18]. One approach is to handle grains explicitly and represent each of them in the model. This leads to large computational demands because of the lack of scale separation. Such constitutive models must be able to account for size effects which are characteristic of small-scale structures. This is confirmed following a number of theoretical and experimental studies of Fleck et al. [19], Stolken and Evans [20], and Lam et al. [21]. From an experimental observation from bending test of epoxy polymeric microbeams, Lam et al. [21] point out that the bending rigidity increases 2.4 times as a result of the reduction of the beam thickness from 115 µm to 20 µm.Recent advances in technology lead to new industrial fields in which small-scale elements are involved.

        <p>In order to take into account the size effects, a number theories have been developed including nonlocal elasticity theory [22], strain gradient theory [23], and modified couple stress theory [24]. It is worth noting that the classical elasticity is fundamentally founded by the introduction of the Hooke's Law in which the force and the change in displacement are linearly related via the stiffness of the component where the forces are applied. This physical principle governs the linearly elastic behaviour of materials. Aiming at a more general description of materials' responses, Mindlin and Tiersten [25] and Mindlin [26] developed higher-order theories of elasticity. Based on the employment of deformation metrics, those theories can be classified into two categories: strain gradient and couple stress theories. With regard to the strain gradient theories, this concept was first developed by Fleck and Hutchinson [23] in which Mindlin's theory [26] was extended. There are two components, which are classified using the second-order deformation tensor that include stretch gradient tensor and rotation gradient tensor [27]. Within the concept of couple stress theory, both strain and curvature jointly govern the strength of the solid. In addition, while the antisymmetric part of the second-order deformation gradients represent rotation gradients, the symmetric part is neglected. Based on the initial ideas of the couple stress theory, a number of attempts have been conducted to further develop such concepts that are applicable to size-dependent problems. Yang et al. [24] proposed the equilibrium of moment of couples which was an additional equilibrium relation that forces the couple stress tensor to be symmetric. Therefore, the deformation energy is only influenced by the symmetric part of the rotation gradient and the symmetric part of the displacement gradient. In addition, instead of using two material length scale parameters as needed in the classical couple stress theory, this modified couple stress theory (MCST) requires only one material length scale parameter to construct the constitutive relation. Park and Gao [28] utilised the principle of minimum total potential energy to develop a variational formulation of the MCST. This method not only derives the equilibrium equations but also forms the introduction of boundary conditions which are not available in Yang's theory [24]. Possessing those beneficial characteristics in which a symmetric couple stress included and only one material length scale parameter involved, the MCST is considered to have advantages over other size-dependent theories such as classical couple stress theory and nonlocal theory.In order to take into account the size effects, a number theories have been developed including nonlocal elasticity theory [22], strain gradient theory [23], and modified couple stress theory [24].

        <p>In recent years, the MCST has been applied to study various behaviours at small-scales. For beam analysis, static bending, buckling, and vibration analysis have been solved using Euler-Bernoulli [29], Timoshenko [30][31][32][33], and higher-order beam theories [34]. The MCST was also applied to small-scale plate analyses in several ways, Tsiatas [35] initially employed it to investigate the static bending response of isotropic Kirchhoff microplates. Yin et al. [36] investigated the vibration behaviour of Kirchhoff microplates using the standard separation of variables to derive the closed-form solution for natural frequencies. Bending and vibration behaviours of Mindlin microplates were studied by Ma et al. [37] in which the thickness stretching effect was also taken into account. With regard to small-scale functionally graded (FG) structures, a number of investigations have been conducted for FG microbeams and microplates using the MCST. Static bending and buckling of FG microbeams were studied by Simsek et al. [38] and Nateghi et al. [39]. Thai and his colleagues utilised the Navier's approach to deriving solutions for FG microplates in which Kirchhoff, Mindlin and sinusoidal plate theories were used [40][41][42]. Ke et al. [43,44] employed the p-version of the Ritz method and different quadrature method to solve free vibration and bending, buckling problems of the rectangular and annular FG Mindlin microplates, respectively. Using the MCST, a refined plate theory was utilised to predict the bending, buckling, and vibration behaviours of FG microplates by He et al. [45] following the Navier approach. Reddy et al. [46][47][48][49] studied the nonlinear behaviour of small-scale FG microplates for different geometries based on finite element method (FEM) with eleven-unknown C 0 element formulation. Most of these efforts followed either analytical approaches being able to solve specific problem for a limit set of boundary conditions or C 0 FEMs with high number of unknowns which are computationally expensive.In recent years, the MCST has been applied to study various behaviours at small-scales.

        <p>A large proportion of the studies in small-scale FG structures employs the classical plate theory (CPT) and the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT). However, the CPT (or the Kirchhoff-Love theory), which neglects shear deformation, provides acceptable solutions for thin plates (i.e. length-to-thickness ratios are larger than 20) only. The FSDT (or Reissner-Mindlin plate theory), which accounts for transverse shear effects, is applicable for both thin and moderately thick plates [50][51][52]. The shortcomings of the FSDT include inac-curate distribution of transverse shear strain/stress and violation of traction free boundary conditions at the top and bottom surfaces. For this reason, shear correction factors are required to adjust the transverse shear stress distribution. However, these factors vary from problem to problem and one may find it difficult to choose appropriate values in general. In order to avoid using shear correction factors, the third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) [53], higher-order shear deformation theory (HSDT) [54], sinusoidal shear deformation theory (SSDT) [55], and refined plate theories (RPT) [56] have been developed yielding more accurate and robust results. The RPT was initially proposed by Senthilnathan et al. [56] by employing four independent unknowns which is one less than that of TSDT. Shimpi et al. [57][58][59] then further developed the RPT for isotropic and orthotropic plates by using only two variables. However, HSDT and RPT require the C 1 -continuity of the generalised displacements which cause significant challenge to derive the second derivative of deflection in the framework of finite element analysis (FEA) with C 0 elements. In order to overcome these continuity issues, some C 0 approximations [60] and Hermite interpolation functions with C 1 elements [8] which involve adding extra variables of derivative of displacement can be adopted.A large proportion of the studies in small-scale FG structures employs the classical plate theory (CPT) and the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT).

        <p>Recently, a new numerical method so-called Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) which is able to deal with C 1 -continuity problem without using any additional variables or Hermite interpolation function has been introduced by Hughes and his co-workers [61]. This method bridges the existing gap between computer-aided design (CAD) and the fields of FEA. The essential idea of the IGA is that the basis functions, commonly the non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), which are employed to exactly describe the geometry domain will also be used for approximations of the unknown fields. In addition, these basic functions are high smoothness and able to tailor the continuity order easily through the domain [61,62]. With these striking features, the NURBS-based IGA appears to be a potential approach in dealing with the C 1 HSDT and RPT problems [63]. One may find the guidance on computer implementation of IGA in the literature [64][65][66]. IGA has been widely implemented in a number of linearly and non-linearly mechanical and thermal problems such as static, free vibration, and buckling of laminated composite and FG plates with various plate theories including layerwise [67], FSDT [68][69][70], HSDT [71][72][73], and RPT [63]. The IGA is also applicable for the analysis of the shell structures [74][75][76]. However, as far as authors are aware, there is no work published on the analysis of small-scale plates based on the MCST and NURBS basis functions.Recently, a new numerical method so-called Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) which is able to deal with C 1 -continuity problem without using any additional variables or Hermite interpolation function has been introduced by Hughes and his co-workers [61].

        <p>In this study, the bending, free vibration and buckling behaviours of FG microplates based on the MCST and four-variable refined plate and quasi-3D theories are investigated using IGA. While the MCST is employed to capture the small-scale effects, the displacement fields of those microplates are expressed based on a novel seventh-order refined plate theory and quasi-3D theory. The mechanical behaviour of FG microplates is then analysed by this IGA in which NURBS functions are simultaneously used to exactly describe the geometry and construct the basis functions of the approximations. It is worth mentioning that even though NURBS may not fully perform their ability to describe geometry exactly since the plate's domains investigated in this study are not highly complex, NURBS far outweigh traditional FEA in the higher-order derivative of approximations which are essentially required in the proposed RPT and MCST.In this study, the bending, free vibration and buckling behaviours of FG microplates based on the MCST and four-variable refined plate and quasi-3D theories are investigated using IGA.

        <p>As can be observed, this quasi-3D model has a similar form to that of the four-variable refined plate theory shown in Eq. (12). Indeed, the displacement field based on the refined plate theory can be readily obtained by simplifying those of quasi-3D theory in which f and φ are replaced by g and 1, respectively. In addition, this formulation of quasi-3D displacement field requires less number of unknowns than that of existing theories [86][87][88]. It is worth noting that although, by the theoretical material models, the neutral plane of the functionally graded plate would not perfectly coincide with its mid-plane, the assumption of their coincidence which is widely used is applied in the above displacement fields.As can be observed, this quasi-3D model has a similar form to that of the four-variable refined plate theory shown in Eq.

It is noted that since no study on the static behaviours of CCCC microplates using MCST is reported in the literature, the results are compared with those generated from Reddy's HSDT model [53] using the proposed IGA approach. As can be seen, the results based on Reddy's model are in excellent agreement with the proposed RPT-based solutions. The effects of material index n and material length scale on the central displacement of a CCCC square Al/Al 2 O 3 plate are depicted in Fig. 7 in which data are generated by the proposed RPT and quasi-3D theories for three different ratios /h of 0, 0.4 and 1.0. As can be observed, an increase in the material index n leads to a rise of the plate's central deflection due to the decrease in the plate's stiffness. On the contrary, the growth of the material length scale ratio /h is followed by a decline in the displacement. In other words, for specific material length scale , the thinner the microplate, the higher plate's stiffness. It can be further observed that the discrepancy in terms of central deflection by the proposed RPT and quasi-3D is significantly decreased as /h increases and vanishes when /h = 1.0.

It can be seen that the results given in Table 7 agree well with other published works. The proposed RPT and quasi-3D models using IGA are further tested for homogeneous square microplates. The results shown in Table 8 are compared with analytical solutions generated from CPT by Yin et al. [36] and TSDT by Thai and Kim [40] . As can be observed, while the proposed RPT model yields slight discrepancy with respect to Yin et al.'s [36] due to their CPT assumption neglecting shear deformations, it shows excellent agreement with Thai and Kim [40], especially as plates become thinner, i.e. a/h ratio is relatively large.

        <p>Table 9 presents non-dimensional natural frequency of SSSS Al/Al 2 O 3 square microplates. The results are compared with those of Thai and Kim [40] in which an analytical approach based on TSDT model is employed. Thick (a/h = 5), moderately thick (a/h = 20) and thin (a/h = 100) microplates are considered. The results reveal good agreement between the RPT and TSDT [40], especially when the material length scale ratio /h is small, e.g. 0 or 0.2. On the contrary, the discrepancy becomes larger as /h gets closer to 1. However, this phenomenon just happens for thick plates and tends to be less pronounced as the plates become thinner. Meanwhile, the quasi-3D gives slightly different results compared to that of RPT model. A general observation from Table 9 reveals that the higher material length scale ratio is chosen, the larger the natural frequencies of the plates the plate's stiffness increases. Fig. 9 presents the variation of the normalised natural frequency of CCCC Al/Al 2 O 3 square microplate with respect to the material length scale parameter ratio /h, plate's aspect ratio a/h with different values of material index n. Fig. 10 provides a closer look at the effects of material index n and material length scale ratio /h on the plate's natural frequencies which are computed using the proposed RPT and quasi-3D models.Table 9 presents non-dimensional natural frequency of SSSS Al/Al 2 O 3 square microplates.

        <p>Similar to the previous case of bending analysis, the plate's stiffness decreases as a result of rising in material index n and decreasing material length scale ratio /h which leads to a decrease in natural frequency of the plate. In addition, the discrepancy in terms of frequency results predicted by the proposed RPT and quasi-3D becomes less significant as /h gets bigger and almost vanish difference when /h = 1.0. The first six natural frequencies of Al/Al 2 O 3 square microplates with different types of boundary conditions are given in Table 10 in which the results are generated for n = 1 and /h = 0.2. The present quasi-3D results show good agreement with those of Zenkour's quasi-3D model [84] using the proposed IGA approach.

        <p>In the next step, free vibration of circular plates whose geometry configuration and mesh are shown in Fig. 12 will be investigated. Since there is no publication on the vibration behaviours of FG circular microplates based on the MCST, the investigation of circular plates in this study can serve as benchmark examples. Table 11 presents the fundamental natural frequencies which are firstly tested for homogeneous plates. Natural frequencies of plates without considering size-dependent effects (l = 0) are compared with results reported by Mohammadi et al. [95] and Nguyen et al. [91].

        <p>The buckling behaviour of square and circular FG microplates is discussed. In order to verify the proposed method and models in dealing with buckling analysis, the critical buckling load of SSSS FG microplates bearing biaxial loads is firstly calculated. The results are compared with analytical solutions based on the CPT and the FSDT by Thai and Choi [41] and refined plate theory by He et al. [45] for which material properties are E 1 = 14.4GPa, ρ 1 = 12.2 × 10 3 kg/m 3 , E 2 = 1.44GPa, ρ 2 = 1.22 × 10 3 kg/m 3 , ν 1 = ν 2 = 0.38. As can be seen in Table 13, although there is discrepancy for the case of thick microplates (a/h = 5), the results predicted by proposed RPT theory are in good agreement with those calculated by FSDT [41] and RPT [45] as plates become thinner. On the other hand, while CPTbased solutions are significantly different compared to that of FDST and RPTs due to the ignorance of shear deformations, especially for thick plates, the proposed quasi-3D theory which takes into account normal deformation yields similar results with respect to those of shear deformable theories of FSDT and RPTs.The buckling behaviour of square and circular FG microplates is discussed.

        <p>In this study, a novel computational approach, based on the modified couple stress theory, the four-variable refined plate theory and the quasi-3D theory, and the NURBS-based isogeometric analysis, has been presented to investigate the static bending, free vibration, and buckling of functionally graded microplates with various geometries and boundary conditions. Within this proposed approach, the mathematical model governing the behaviour of the plates is constructed based on the modified couple stress theory with only one material length scale which efficiently accounts for the size dependency in small-scale structures. The novel seventh-order refined plate theory and quasi-3D theory with only four unknowns are also presented. This proposed quasi-3D approach not only considers shear deformations but also is able to accurately capture the thickness stretching effect which is neglected by other classical, higher-order shear deformation, and refined plate theories. The NURBS-based isogeometric analysis is used to exactly describe the geometry and approximately construct the unknown field in which the higher-order continuity requirement of the proposed kinematical and constitutive theories are readily satisfied. A number of investigations including novel benchmark problems which have never been reported in the literature have confirmed the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results also reveal that increase of the material length scale parameter ratio rises the microplate's stiffness which results in a decrease in the central displacement and an increase in the natural frequency and buckling load. On the contrary, an increase in the material index leads to the opposite effect in which the microplate's stiffness decreases. For all cases considered, the numerical results that are generated by the proposed refined plate theory and quasi-3D theory are slightly different due to the consideration of the thickness stretching effect. However, these discrepancies become less pronounced as the microplate becomes thinner.In this study, a novel computational approach, based on the modified couple stress theory, the four-variable refined plate theory and the quasi-3D theory, and the NURBS-based isogeometric analysis, has been presented to investigate the static bending, free vibration, and buckling of functionally graded microplates with various geometries and boundary conditions.
