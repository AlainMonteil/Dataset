        <p>Introduction: Adequate head and neck (HN) organ-at-risk (OAR) delineation is crucial for HN radiotherapy and for investigating the relationships between radiation dose to OARs and radiation-induced side effects. The automatic contouring algorithms that are currently in clinical use, such as atlas-based contouring (ABAS), leave room for improvement. The aim of this study was to use a comprehensive evaluation methodology to investigate the performance of HN OAR auto-contouring when using deep learning contouring (DLC), compared to ABAS. Methods: The DLC neural network was trained on 589 HN cancer patients. DLC was compared to ABAS by providing each method with an independent validation cohort of 104 patients, which had also been manually contoured. For each of the 22 OAR contours -glandular, upper digestive tract and central nervous system (CNS)-related structures -the dice similarity coefficient (DICE), and absolute mean and max dose differences (|Dmean-dose| and |Dmax-dose|) performance measures were obtained. For a subset of 7 OARs, an evaluation of contouring time, inter-observer variation and subjective judgement was performed.Introduction: Adequate head and neck (HN) organ-at-risk (OAR) delineation is crucial for HN radiotherapy and for investigating the relationships between radiation dose to OARs and radiation-induced side effects.

        <p>Results: DLC resulted in equal or significantly improved quantitative performance measures in 19 out of 22 OARs, compared to the ABAS (DICE/|Dmean dose|/|Dmax dose|: 0.59/4.2/4.1 Gy (ABAS); 0.74/1.1/0.8 Gy (DLC)). The improvements were mainly for the glandular and upper digestive tract OARs. DLC significantly reduced the delineation time for the inexperienced observer. The subjective evaluation showed that DLC contours were more often preferable to the ABAS contours overall, were considered to be more precise, and more often confused with manual contours. Manual contours still outperformed both DLC and ABAS; however, DLC results were within or bordering the inter-observer variability for the manual edited contours in this cohort.Results: DLC resulted in equal or significantly improved quantitative performance measures in 19 out of 22 OARs, compared to the ABAS (DICE/|Dmean dose|/|Dmax dose|: 0.59/4.2/4.1 Gy (ABAS); 0.74/1.1/0.8 Gy (DLC)).

        <p>Research on side effects of radiotherapy has been a steadily growing field of interest, as advances in treatment (e.g. multimodality imaging, proton therapy, targeted agents) have led to both increased life expectancy in cancer survivors and a greater degree of control in sparing organs-at-risk (OARs) [1]. Adequate delineation of OARs is crucial when investigating the association between radiation dose and side effects and when optimizing treatment planning. However, manual contouring of OARs is very time-consuming [2] and is prone to inter-observer variability [3,4]. This task requires significant expertise, especially for head and neck (HN) cancer patients, due to the complex anatomy.Research on side effects of radiotherapy has been a steadily growing field of interest, as advances in treatment (e.g. multimodality imaging, proton therapy, targeted agents) have led to both increased life expectancy in cancer survivors and a greater degree of control in sparing organs-at-risk (OARs) [1].

        <p>Meanwhile, the manual contouring burden on the clinic is rising as a consequence of the increasing number of OARs found to be associated with radiation-induced side effects [5][6][7][8].Meanwhile, the manual contouring burden on the clinic is rising as a consequence of the increasing number of OARs found to be associated with radiation-induced side effects [5][6][7][8].</p>
        <p>Auto-contouring of OARs aims to reduce delineation time and effort, and to improve inter-observer consistency [9][10][11]. Atlasbased auto-contouring (ABAS) is a widely used method in which a set of representative patients with carefully delineated OARs serve as a reference set (i.e. atlas) for contouring new patients [12,13]. OAR contours of the atlas patient(s) are registered to new patients in order to transform (usually with a deformation) and combine their OAR contours in the new scan. Although ABAS has already reduced workload and improved consistency in many radiotherapy departments, there are a number of issues that leave room for improvement. First, ABAS generally underperforms for small and/or thin OARs, such as the swallowing muscles [14].Auto-contouring of OARs aims to reduce delineation time and effort, and to improve inter-observer consistency [9][10][11].

        <p>Secondly, only a limited range of anatomical variation can be represented by typical sets of atlas patients (N = 10-30) as contouring performance generally plateaus with the inclusion of around 10-20 atlases [15,16], leading to poor delineation of structures in patients with anatomies differing from those in the transformed atlases [9]. Third, ABAS is also limited by the accuracy of the deformation between anatomies that, especially for CT, can be limited in areas with uniform intensity, such as soft tissues [17,18]. Finally, even for large databases, selecting the most appropriate atlases may be unreliable, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance [19].Secondly, only a limited range of anatomical variation can be represented by typical sets of atlas patients (N = 10-30) as contouring performance generally plateaus with the inclusion of around 10-20 atlases [15,16], leading to poor delineation of structures in patients with anatomies differing from those in the transformed atlases [9].

        <p>In this study, DLC was trained on a set of 589 HN cancer patients with complete sets of contours for 22 OARs (including glandular, upper digestive tract, central nervous system, bone and vessel related structures). OARs were carefully delineated according to the international OAR consensus guidelines [26]. The performance of DLC was comprehensively evaluated and compared to ABAS in an independent validation cohort of 104 HN cancer patients, using quantitative geometric and dosimetric measures, along with contouring time, inter-observer variation and subjective evaluations.In this study, DLC was trained on a set of 589 HN cancer patients with complete sets of contours for 22 OARs (including glandular, upper digestive tract, central nervous system, bone and vessel related structures).

        <p>A total of 693 HN cancer patients were included in this study (Table 1). All patients were treated with primary curative radiotherapy, with or without systemic treatment, between March 2007 and July 2016 at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). The treatment modalities used were: 3D-CRT (12%), Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) 7 Field IMRT (72%), or 2-ARC VMAT (16%). For most patients 70 Gy was prescribed to the primary tumour in 35 fractions. For each patient, a planning CT scan (Somatom Sensation Open, Somatom Definition AS or Biograph64, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany) was acquired approximately 2 weeks before treatment, with an average voxel size 0.98 Â 0.98 Â 2 mm (range: '0.62 Â 0.62-1.37 Â 1.37' Â '2-4' mm); B30f or I40s\3; 80, 100-120 kV. An iterative metal artifact reduction reconstruction was used from 2015 on to limit the severity of artifacts in the scan on an minority of patients (~18%) and the majority of CT scans were contrast-enhanced (&gt;90%). The clinical treatment plans were used when performing dose estimation. Patients were excluded if they had a salivary gland tumour, received prior HN surgery or radiotherapy. These exclusion criteria is related to an unpublished study cohort that is used for prediction of a comprehensive profile of side-effects of head and neck cancer. Additionally, when the CT scan had an in-plane voxel size larger than 1.5 mm scans were excluded.A total of 693 HN cancer patients were included in this study (Table 1).

        <p>The DLC implementation (DLCExpert TM , Mirada 
            <rs type="creator">Medical Ltd</rs>., UK) deploys multiple CNNs to predict a dense voxel-wise labelling for input CT images. A general 2D multiclass network with 14 layers predicts all OARs at a coarse resolution and its output, along with the CT image data, forms the input to a separately trained 10-layer OAR-specific network to predict the full resolution contours (loss function: cross entropy; batch size: 8 slices). Further details on this method can be found in the 2017 AAPM Challenge [27]. From the full set of 693 patients, 549 non-test cases were used for training and 40 were used for cross-validation to guide the training process. An independent validation and randomly selected cohort of 104 patients was excluded from training and cross-validation (Table 1) for the performance assessment.

The atlas-patient image registration method was based on Lucas-Kanade Optic Flow [28], and a fixed set of atlases were used (i.e. no atlas selection) to generate a consensus contour using a sub-pixel precision form of majority voting [29,30]. The delineations of the atlas patients were carefully checked and patients with metal CT artifacts were excluded from the atlas patient set.

The HD values were significant higher with DLC compared to ABAS for the brainstem and spinal cord (p &lt; 0.001). The |Dmax-dose| values were comparable between the ABAS and DLC, except for a significant increase for the spinal cord (p = 0.04). For the mandible, the DICE and HD values were good for ABAS, but significantly improved with DLC (p &lt; 0.001). For the carotid arteries, DICE values were substantially higher for DLC (0.68 ± 0.11) than for ABAS (0.29 ± 0.12) and HD substantially lower (DLC: 9.6 ± 10.4 mm ABAS: 24.3 ± 15.8 mm).

        <p>For the time evaluation with the blinded approach, the 2 observers adjusted ABAS and DLC contours in two alternating sessions separated by 2 months. The average adjustment delineation time for the expert and beginner observer for the ABAS contours were 36 ± 7 and 59 ± 14 minutes, reducing slightly to 34 ± 6 and 54 ± 8 minutes for the DLC contours, respectively.

        <p>Assessing the inter-observer variation, the DICE values between the adjusted auto-contours and the initial manual contours were for ABAS 0.79 ± 0.08 (beginner) and 0.81 ± 0.05 (expert) and for DLC 0.80 ± 0.06 (beginner) and 0.82 ± 0.05 (expert). Additionally, manual adjustments of the DLC contours showed little improvement in DICE compared to the unedited DLC contours, tested in the validation cohort, in 4 of the 7 OARs (refer to Supplementary data 2 for individual DICE values). The |Dmean-dose| did not change significantly in 5 of the 7 OARs. The average |Dmean-dose| for all 7 OARs and patients was 2.5 ± 2.3 Gy (ABAS) and 1.3 ± 1.6 Gy (DLC) without manual adjustment and 0.9 ± 0.7 Gy (ABAS) and 0.8 ± 0.7 Gy (DLC) with manual adjustment (Supplementary data 3).

        <p>The subjective evaluation (Turing test) was performed by 12 observers: 10 physicians and 2 radiation oncology technicians (involved in clinical practice in OAR contouring and treatment planning). The Turing test was fully completed by 9 observers, generating evaluations for 965 scenarios. For the question ''whether contours were human or computer-created", 40% of the humancreated contours were misclassified as computer-generated (Fig. 6A). The misclassification rate for ABAS contours was 26% and for DLC contours it was 35%. For 5 of the 7 OARs, DLC contours were misclassified being human-created (34%) more often than ABAS (15%) (Fig. 6B). The difference was greatest for the thyroid and parotid gland. For the question ''which of 2 contours was preferred", human contours were substantially more often preferred (81-82%) than either ABAS (18%) or DLC (19%) (Fig. 6C). For observers choosing between DLC and ABAS, DLC was selected substantially more often (66%). For the individual OARs, DLC was preferred more often over ABAS for all OARs except for the glottic area (Fig. 6D). The responses to the question ''Would you correct the contour?" suggest low rates of obvious errors in both human and DLC contours, 7% and 9% respectively (Fig. 6E). In contrast, 30% of ABAS contours were considered to have obvious errors. Nevertheless, DLC had higher minor error rates than human contours, and consequently lower rates of being considered ''precise" by the observers. For all individual OARs (Fig. 6F), human and DLC contours were 'required to be corrected' less often than ABAS except for the oral cavity. Similarly, human-drawn contours were required to be corrected less often than DLC contours, except for the thyroid, cricoid and PCM.The subjective evaluation (Turing test) was performed by 12 observers: 10 physicians and 2 radiation oncology technicians (involved in clinical practice in OAR contouring and treatment planning).

        <p>DLC was trained on a large cohort of 589 HNC patients with 22 high-quality manual HN OAR contours. This work showed that DLC significantly improved the auto-contours of the majority of 22 OARs (Fig. 7), compared to ABAS. The comprehensive evaluation that was carried out on an independent test set (N = 104), using quantitative measures of overlap, distance and dose, as well as subjective assessments and editing time, demonstrated that the greatest improvements were observed in the glandular structures, the upper digestive tract and airway OARs (e.g. the cricoid, PCM, supraglottic larynx and glottic area), arytenoids, and the carotid arteries. These results also translated to a decreased absolute difference between the mean dose/max dose of the auto-contoured and manual OARs (|Dmean-dose|max-dose|in addition to reduced variability between patients. The small dose differences indicate that DLC can be a valuable tool for large retrospective dose analyses such as development and validation of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models.DLC was trained on a large cohort of 589 HNC patients with 22 high-quality manual HN OAR contours.

        <p>Our results show similar DICE scores to those by Liang et al. [22] (e.g. parotid gland: 0.85 ± 0.05, oral cavity: 0.91 ± 0.04), who introduced the innovative approach of training two CNNs on 186 nasopharynx patients, the first detecting a bounding box surrounding the OAR, the second contouring the OAR within it. The higher patient number in our study would theoretically make the system more robust to outlier cases. For the parotid gland, this resulted in Fig. 5. Time evaluation for adjusting 7 OARs with ABAS vs. DLC for the expert and beginner observer (noted as obs.). only marginal improvement. Ibragimov et al. [21] showed slightly lower DICE values (e.g. parotid gland: 0.78 ± 0.05, submandibular gland: 0.73 ± 0.09), with a CNN trained on fewer than 50 HN cases. In contrast to these studies, in the current study, two consecutive CNNs were trained on a much larger and diverse patient cohort, in addition to using an independent validation cohort, providing better estimates of the generalizability and performance. The models also cover a greater number of OARs, including all upper digestive tract and airway OARs in accordance with the most recent delineation guidelines [26].Our results show similar DICE scores to those by Liang et al.

        <p>The time evaluation suggests that DLC may reduce the overall delineation time compared to ABAS, especially for inexperienced delineators. ABAS has been employed for a number of years in our clinic now, manual contouring of the limited OARs studied for the time evaluation study can take up to 90 minutes per patient (internal evaluation). This is in line with previous reported manual contouring time of 108 min for a set of six OARs in the head and neck area [36].The time evaluation suggests that DLC may reduce the overall delineation time compared to ABAS, especially for inexperienced delineators.

        <p>For the CNS OARs, performance measures with ABAS were already good and the DLC (DICE &gt; 0.84 and HD &lt; 3.3 mm) did not out-perform ABAS, approaching the inter-observer variation [38]. This study may be somewhat biased towards the ABAS, since the basis of the manual delineations used in this study were often ABAS (yet with different atlas patients) contours, especially for the CNS and mandible contours. This bias is minimized by the thorough checks and edits of all manual delineations to conform them to the new consensus guidelines, which were performed by a small team of experts.For the CNS OARs, performance measures with ABAS were already good and the DLC (DICE &gt; 0.84 and HD &lt; 3.3 mm) did not out-perform ABAS, approaching the inter-observer variation [38].

        <p>Another limitation concerning the subjective evaluation is the presentation of a single slice per contour to the observers, having access to three-dimensional information might change the results. In addition, ABAS of a single system was compared to the DLC. Other studies showed similar DICE values between ABAS and manual contours with other systems [13,14], but the ABAS contours were subjectively better scored [14]. Moreover, the time and inter-observer evaluation was limited by the number of observers and patients. Furthermore, the DLC did not perform well on CT scans with very different voxel sizes (in-plane &gt;1.5 mm), but did perform well for both non-and contrastenhanced CT scans, and for patients with the different tumour sites. In cases where the auto-contouring failed to produce output, no contour was returned. For DLC, this is because no activation threshold was reached to consider any voxel inside the contour. For ABAS, this is because there were no voxels where the majority of the multi-atlas registrations contours overlapped. Additionally, while ABAS failed to produce arytenoid contours for many patients (69), DLC failed for only 2, illustrating the difficulty for the ABAS to contour small OARs and the relative robustness of DLC. Nevertheless, DLC occasionally omitted to produce contours and this might be helped by an even larger cohort. Finally, our results may be improved by incorporating other image modalities when training DLC models.Another limitation concerning the subjective evaluation is the presentation of a single slice per contour to the observers, having access to three-dimensional information might change the results.

        <p>A DLC model can be more robust than ABAS since it can be trained using as much data as is available, including patients with metal artifacts and diverse anatomy. Additionally, it incorporates appearance and patterns of structures with convolution filters, rather than the anatomic location-and intensity-only approach of the ABAS. For these two reasons, DLC likely outperforms ABAS especially in areas with more anatomic variability [27,39].A DLC model can be more robust than ABAS since it can be trained using as much data as is available, including patients with metal artifacts and diverse anatomy.

        <p>As the Turing Test showed a higher acceptance of DLC contours than ABAS contours (Fig. 6E andF) it was expected to find a much larger time saving from the time evaluation. The reason for the substantial editing times might be a difference between the observer groups. Medical doctors that participated in the Turing Test might be willing to accept minor errors, while the delineators in the time evaluation were more focused on editing all minor errors. This is partly confirmed by the findings presented in Supplementary Data 2, where it can be seen that, for some OARs, the inter-observer variability results in similar DICE scores for human-human comparisons as for human-DLC comparisons. Future work should therefore focus on identifying the reasons and significance of the large editing time of DLC that was found in this study.As the Turing Test showed a higher acceptance of DLC contours than ABAS contours (Fig. 6E andF) it was expected to find a much larger time saving from the time evaluation.

        <p>In conclusion, DLC, trained on a large cohort, outperformed ABAS for the majority of HN OARs. The improved quantitative performance translated to smaller dosimetric differences compared to the manual contours. Although manual contours were clearly preferred and less often required to be corrected than both DLC and ABAS contours, DLC outperformed the ABAS in nearly all subjective assessments. Additionally, the time evaluation showed significant benefit for the inexperienced delineator. DLC has the potential to reduce clinical burden by reducing the delineation time required to produce acceptable contours and currently replaced ABAS in routine use in our clinic.In conclusion, DLC, trained on a large cohort, outperformed ABAS for the majority of HN OARs.
