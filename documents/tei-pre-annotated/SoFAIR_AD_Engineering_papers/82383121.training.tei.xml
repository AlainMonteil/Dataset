        <p>Lignin is a complex polyphenolic constituent of plant secondary cell walls. Inspired largely by the recalcitrance of lignin to biomass processing, plant engineering efforts have routinely sought to alter lignin quantity, composition, and structure by exploiting the inherent plasticity of lignin biosynthesis. More recently, researchers are attempting to strategically design plants for increased degradability by incorporating monomers that lead to a lower degree of polymerisation, reduced hydrophobicity, fewer bonds to other cell wall constituents, or novel chemically labile linkages in the polymer backbone. In addition, the incorporation of value-added structures could help valorise lignin. Designer lignins may satisfy the biological requirement for lignification in plants while improving the overall efficiency of biomass utilisation.Lignin is a complex polyphenolic constituent of plant secondary cell walls.

        <p>Lignin is a complex polyphenolic constituent of the secondary cell walls of vascular plants, accounting for 18-35% of the biomass by weight [1]. It is a crucial element of water conduction and plant defence systems in tracheophytes, and it contributes significantly to the compressive strength of secondary xylem tissues. Consequently, lignification of the plant vascular system represents an important evolutionary milestone for land plants. Lignin is one of the most abundant biopolymers on the planet and is an immensely important global carbon sink. However, the chemical recalcitrance of lignin poses a major challenge for industrial biomass processing, most notably in pulp and paper production and in the emerging cellulosic biofuels industry [2,3]. In addition, the lignin content of forage crops is an important consideration in animal nutrition and feed conversion rates in agriculture [4].Lignin is a complex polyphenolic constituent of the secondary cell walls of vascular plants, accounting for 18-35% of the biomass by weight [1].

        <p>Polymeric lignin is constructed primarily from three 4-hydroxyphenylpropanoids known as monolignolsp-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol -that differ only in the degree of aromatic ring methoxylation (Figure 1) [5]. Once incorporated into a lignin polymer, they produce p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) moieties. These canonical monolignols are synthesised in the cytoplasm prior to export to the site of polymerisation in the cell wall where laccase and peroxidase enzymes generate monolignol radicals by dehydrogenation, either through direct action on the monolignols or via a redox shuttle [6]. The incorporation of monolignols into a growing lignin polymer via the combinatorial coupling of radicals results in highly variable racemic polymers with different physicochemical features [7]. For example, gymnosperm lignin is more resistant to degradation largely because it is composed primarily of G subunits that yield abundant b-5, 5-5, and b-b carbon-carbon bonds in addition to the less resilient ether-type b-O-4 linkages that feature more prominently in the S-rich lignins of angiosperms. The amount, composition, and structure of lignins are highly diverse across plant taxa, cell types, developmental stages, and across the cell wall layers. Lignin is embedded in the cell walls of the plant vasculature, notably in the xylem fibres and vessel elements that constitute the bulk of secondary xylem tissues, but also in the sclerenchyma fibres and sclereids in xylem and phloem, and in the cortex cells of the periderm.Polymeric lignin is constructed primarily from three 4-hydroxyphenylpropanoids known as monolignolsp-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol -that differ only in the degree of aromatic ring methoxylation (Figure 1) [5].

        <p>Lignin recalcitrance has received considerable research attention and recent advances in our understanding of lignin biogenesis have provoked novel approaches in plant biotechnology [8][9][10]. In this review, we summarise the progress in lignin engineering, highlight developments within the past three years in the area of designer lignins, and chart a course forward to producing less recalcitrant or more valuable lignins thereby highlighting the potential to enhance the overall utility of this abundant natural polymer. deposition into the plant cell wall (see Figure 2 for a detailed overview of the biosynthetic pathways including enzyme abbreviations) [5]. Seven enzyme-catalysed steps of the plastid-localised shikimate pathway convert photosynthate-derived phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phospate into chorismate, and further transformations yield the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Phenylalanine is then shuttled to the cytosol where the first dedicated step of the general phenylpropanoid pathway is its deamination to produce cinnamic acid. Thereafter, an intricate succession of aromatic ring hydroxylations and catechol unit O-methylations interspersed with the activation of cinnamate as a CoA thioester and subsequent reduction via the aldehyde eventually yield the monolignols. There are numerous inter-species variations in the architecture of the lignin biosynthetic pathway, particularly in the preferred route through the metabolic grid. For example, grasses are uniquely capable of using tyrosine in addition to phenylalanine, and gymnosperms are generally unable to produce sinapyl alcohol because the requisite hydroxylase is absent [11].Lignin recalcitrance has received considerable research attention and recent advances in our understanding of lignin biogenesis have provoked novel approaches in plant biotechnology [8][9][10].

        <p>Lignin engineering efforts were initially focused largely on the enzymes directly involved in the general phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways. Mutants or transgenics with targeted downregulation of key biosynthetic genes in diverse plant species have shown varying levels of reduced lignin production [8]. However, monolignol biosynthesis is highly plastic, allowing plants to substitute monolignols when one or more of the genes is disrupted or misregulated such that lignin composition and quantity are often concomitantly altered. For example, suppression of C3 0 H in hybrid poplar resulted in a 60% reduction in lignin as well as a shift toward H units [12], whereas knockdown of PAL in Brachypodium led to 43% less lignin and a relative increase in S and H units [13]. On the other hand, the Arabidopsis fah1 mutant lacks a functional F5H, corresponding to a near-complete loss of S units but no significant change in total lignin content [14]. As lignin structure is a reflection of the monomers available during polymerisation and the prevalence of different linkage types is a major determinant of chemical resilience, lignin composition represents an important parameter in biomass recalcitrance that rivals finite lignin content. For instance, the S to G lignin ratio in transgenic hybrid poplar lines has been positively correlated with cell-wall bioconversion rates [15].Lignin engineering efforts were initially focused largely on the enzymes directly involved in the general phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways.

        <p>Non-canonical monolignols are also amenable to lignification, further emphasising the plasticity of lignin biogenesis. In transgenic poplar for example, downregulation of CCR has been shown to lead to the low-level incorporation of ferulic acid [16], downregulation of CAD results in the incorporation of hydroxycinnamaldehydes [17,18], and a reduction in COMT expression leads to a lignin derived, in part, from 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol [19]. Similarly, suppression of CCoAOMT in transgenic pine cell cultures leads to the incorporation of caffeyl alcohol [20]. Interestingly, the seed coats of Vanilla planifolia and several Cactaceae species contain a lignin derived almost entirely from this monomer or the related 5hydroxyconiferyl alcohol [21 ,22]. More evidence of lignin plasticity is offered by the incorporation of g-acylated monolignol conjugates, namely acetylated monolignols in kenaf, sisal, palm and abaca, p-hydroxybenzoylated monolignols in poplar, willow and palm, and p-coumaroylated monolignols in the commelinid monocots [23]. In effect, any compatible phenolic compounds present at the site of polymerisation in the cell wall are 'candidates' for radical transfer, radical-radical coupling, and lignin polymerisation [24]. Although covalent bonds have been shown to link lignin and some hemicelluloses, most notably via the dehydrodimerisation of ferulate on arabinoxylans in grasses [25], the direct attachment of lignin to hemicellulose remains difficult to authenticate [26]. Similarly, cell wall proteins could also become covalently bound to lignin, but this too remains largely unexplored [27].Non-canonical monolignols are also amenable to lignification, further emphasising the plasticity of lignin biogenesis.

        <p>There has been remarkable progress in altering the amount and composition of lignin by targeting the general phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways, but lignin-modified plants often exhibit developmental defects ranging from stem lodging to dwarfism. It may simply be that reduced lignin content alters structural integrity and impairs water transport, and such plants often have collapsed xylem cells [28]. However, perturbations to the biosynthetic pathway may also result in the overproduction of other phenylpropanoids and glycoside derivatives that provoke diverse pleiotropic effects [29]. Besides lignin, the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways also give rise to an array of other primary and secondary metabolites. Moving forward, lignin engineering strategies should contemplate the effects of altered metabolic flux on related pathways and metabolites. Moreover, rewiring these metabolic networks will be an important element of innovative strategies that incorporate alternative monomers into designer lignins.There has been remarkable progress in altering the amount and composition of lignin by targeting the general phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways, but lignin-modified plants often exhibit developmental defects ranging from stem lodging to dwarfism.

        <p>It is now eminently feasible to produce genetically engineered plants with severely reduced lignin levels delivering improved biomass processing; however, such plants are often less vigorous and agronomically inferior [28,29]. By engineering the chemical structure of lignin without drastically altering lignin content or functionality, it may be possible to satisfy the biological requirement for lignification while concomitantly reducing recalcitrance. Novel physicochemical properties could render lignin more easily extractable during processing and could even create new avenues in biomass utilisation [30 ]. At least five types of these designer lignins have been proposed: (A) lignins with a lower degree of polymerisation, (B) Current Opinion in Biotechnology lignins that are less hydrophobic, (C) lignins with fewer bonds to structural carbohydrates, (D) lignins containing chemically labile bonds, and (E) lignins designed to harbour value-added chemical moieties (Figure 3). Several examples of these designer lignins will be described here to illustrate the breadth of possibilities.It is now eminently feasible to produce genetically engineered plants with severely reduced lignin levels delivering improved biomass processing; however, such plants are often less vigorous and agronomically inferior [28,29].

        <p>Although conventional wisdom maintains that lignin polymers have a high molecular weight and are extensively cross-linked, recent evidence suggests that native lignin comprises relatively short oligomeric chains with only minimal branching [31]. Nonetheless, lignins with reduced degrees of polymerisation may be more readily extracted. Incorporation of monomers capable only of single coupling reactions that either initiate ('starters') or terminate ('stoppers') chain elongation could reduce average lignin polymer chain lengths. For example, dihydroconiferyl alcohol found in the lignin of gymnosperms [17], as well as hydroxyphenylglycerols (Figure 3e) and hydroxybenzenoids detected in a variety of plants, can serve as lignin initiators [7,32 ]. A greater prevalence of these groups during active polymerisation may lead to more polymer initiation events resulting in more lignin chains that are shorter. Consistent with this approach, expression of the bacterial hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase-lyase gene in Arabidopsis lignifying cells did not alter plant growth or overall lignin content but did lead to sidechain shortening of monomers, the incorporation of phydroxybenzaldehyde and p-hydroxybenzoate groups, reduced lignin chain length, and improved saccharification [32 ]. An analogous tactic is to exploit the relative oxidation potential of different monomers in an effort to introduce more end-groups. For example, p-coumaryl alcohol favours radical transfer reactions and frequently occurs as free-phenolic endgroups such that H-rich lignins have a lower degree of polymerisation [33]. The Srich lignin from transgenic poplar overexpressing F5H also appears to have a remarkably shorter chain length with an average degree of polymerisation of approximately 10 (Figure 3b) [34].Although conventional wisdom maintains that lignin polymers have a high molecular weight and are extensively cross-linked, recent evidence suggests that native lignin comprises relatively short oligomeric chains with only minimal branching [31].

        <p>Additionally, increased hydrophilicity could reduce hydrophobic interactions in the cell wall and improve enzyme accessibility during saccharification. Various alternative strategies are conceivable and candidate monomers may contain additional hydroxyl groups or conjugated hydrophilic moieties, such as carbohydrates [35] (e.g., Figure 3e-g). The opposite strategy could be favourable; molecular dynamics simulations of lignin with increased hydrophobicity predicted a reduction of noncovalent associations between lignin and hemicelluloses [36] that could make the cell wall polysaccharides more accessible during saccharification.Additionally, increased hydrophilicity could reduce hydrophobic interactions in the cell wall and improve enzyme accessibility during saccharification.

        <p>In addition to non-covalent interactions, lignin is conjectured to be linked to hemicelluloses through various types of covalent bonds. Whenever a monolignol couples via its b position to the growing polymer (or to another monomer), a quinone methide intermediate is produced and, in the case of the dominant b-ether units, this is overwhelmingly quenched and re-aromatised via nucleophilic attack from water (Figure 1c) [7]. Alcohol and carboxylic acid groups inherent to hemicelluloses may also theoretically serve as nucleophiles giving rise to the benzyl ether or benzyl ester bonds that contribute to recalcitrant lignin-carbohydrate complexes, but compelling evidence for this is still lacking. Potentially useful novel units containing o-diphenol groups, such as those arising from caffeyl alcohol or 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol, result in quinone methide intermediates that are rapidly internally trapped, forming benzodioxane structures (Figure 3c) before any possibility of external nucleophilic attack can occur. A number of similar candidate monomers that could reduce polysaccharide-lignin cross-linking have recently been validated in biomimetic in vitro studies, including rosmarinic acid, epicatechin, ethyl gallate and epigallocatechin [35,37]. As noted above, monocots have a distinctive mechanism for cross-linking cell wall polymers to strengthen the wall; arabinoxylan is acylated with ferulate moieties that can radically crosscouple to adjacent feruloylated hemicellulose chains or to lignin resulting in extensive polysaccharide-polysaccharide and polysaccharide-lignin cross-linking (Figure 3i As has been shown, various perturbations of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway result in a shift in monomer composition that may yield more chemically labile bonds [5,8,30 ]. For example, ferulic acid incorporates into the lignin of CCR-deficient plants producing acid-labile acetals [16], and overexpression of F5H in hybrid poplar results in a lignin containing nearly 98% S units yielding more alkali-labile b-ethers (Figure 3b) [34]. One of the most highly sought after objectives has been the introduction of S lignin units into conifer tree species that normally contain the more recalcitrant G-rich lignin.In addition to non-covalent interactions, lignin is conjectured to be linked to hemicelluloses through various types of covalent bonds.

        <p>Recently, an important proof-of-principle milestone was achieved with the simultaneous introduction of COMT and F5H genes into transgenic pine cell cultures [11]. The 'zip-lignin' strategy has also been heralded as a major breakthrough in designer lignins [23,39 ]. Inspired by the proven incorporation of ferulates integrally into grass lignins, an exotic feruloyl-CoA:monolignol transferase from Angelica sinensis was introduced into hybrid poplar and resulted in a lignin in which chemically labile ester bonds had been integrated into the polymer backbone (Figure 3d), improving cell wall digestibility after mild alkaline pretreatment [39 ]. Recently, a bacterial Ca-dehydrogenase was shown to oxidise the a-hydroxyl groups in lignin and, when introduced into transgenic Arabidopsis, yielded low levels of novel chemically labile a-keto-b-ether units in lignin [40 ]. Finally, as amino acids are also capable of cross-linking to lignin, an alternative approach is to direct tyrosine-rich or cysteine-rich peptides to the cell wall such that protease enzymes could digest these cross-links and accelerate lignin digestion [41].Recently, an important proof-of-principle milestone was achieved with the simultaneous introduction of COMT and F5H genes into transgenic pine cell cultures [11].

        <p>Lignin extracted during industrial biomass processing is frequently used for its calorific value, being burnt to provide process energy. But recently, aspirations of complete biomass utilisation within the modern biorefinery have inspired an array of lignin-derived high-value products [42]. Research in this area has primarily focused on optimising lignin recovery and developing products from lignin that can compete with existing petroleumderived materials. However, moving forward, inherently valuable lignin polymers could be developed to facilitate the production of novel high-value products using industrial lignin waste streams. The abundant aldehyde groups in the above-mentioned hydroxycinnamaldehyde-derived lignins from CAD-deficient plants [17,18] create enormous potential for functionalisation in diverse applications. Lignins derived solely from caffeyl alcohol or 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol monomers produce homogeneous linear lignin chains of b-O-4-derived benzodioxane units (Figure 3c) [21 ,22]. Such regularity would likely be beneficial in applications such as the generation of lignin-derived carbon fibres, due to its homogeneous structure and lower complexity. However, as intriguing as the possibilities are, it is not yet clear that large, healthy plants can be produced with such lignins. Nature herself is revealing pathways by which valued products could naturally be produced in lignins and is even showing how they can be arranged to be on the end of a chain where they are, presumably, easiest to cleave off. For example, it was recently discovered that the flavonoid tricin is naturally incorporated into monocot lignins, as (starting) endgroups (Figure 3h) [43 ]. This discovery, further illustrating the inherent plasticity of lignification, was particularly remarkable because tricin is not produced via the monolignol biosynthetic pathway so it exemplifies how, through thoughtful metabolic engineering, it may be possible to incorporate other unique and valuable chemical constituents into lignin. Given the abundance of surplus lignin available in industry, it is plausible that even low-level production of value-added lignins could help economise total biomass utilisation in biorefineries.Lignin extracted during industrial biomass processing is frequently used for its calorific value, being burnt to provide process energy.

Photosynthate, supplied as sucrose and stored transiently as starch, is metabolised in sink tissues via glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to produce phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate. These in turn are converted via the shikimate pathway into chorismate. The aromatic amino acid pathway yields phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan (not shown). Finally, the monolignols, primarily p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, are produced through the general phenylpropanoid pathway and the monolignol-specific biosynthetic pathway. Enzymatic reactions and metabolite shuttling are shown in orange, the plastid as well as membrane transporters and the inner and outer plastid membranes are coloured in green, the ER and ER membranes are depicted in blue, and the plasma membrane and cell wall are highlighted in yellow. Note that not all routes shown have been demonstrated in all plants; for example: TAL has been found only in monocots, CSE activity has only been demonstrated in Arabidopsis so far, F5H is absent from most gymnosperms, and the route from p-coumarate directly to caffeate has only been demonstrated in poplar. The cascade of transcriptional regulation is shown in purple and includes proteins from the MYB, KNAT and NAC families of transcription factors as well as two subunits of the Mediator transcriptional co-regulator complex.

        <p>A number of potential alternative monomers has been proposed, many of which have overlapping functionalities in designer lignins [30 ]. For example, rosmarinic acid is a hydrophilic compound with a chemically labile ester linkage and two o-diphenol groups (Figure 3g) [ As the regulation of monolignol biosynthesis is largely enacted through transcriptional control, considerable attention has been devoted to demystifying these processes and harnessing them to actively switch biosynthesis on or off at will. In addition to the array of MYB family transcription factors that activate monolignol biosynthetic genes and the NAC family transcription factors that serve as master switches for secondary cell wall biosynthesis, subunits of the transcriptional co-regulator Mediator have recently been identified as homeostatic repressors of monolignol biosynthesis and all of these show promise in lignin engineering [45,46 ] (Figure 2). Although many designer monomers may originate from the phenylpropanoid pathway directly, other monomers may have different metabolic origins and regulatory constraints. It also remains to be seen how designer lignins might ensure adequate cell wall properties in the context of recently proposed cell wall integrity models [29,47]. Although monolignol transport mechanisms remain obscure, recent evidence points to active transport through membrane-bound transporter proteins [48]. The realisation that alternative monomers are also translocated to the site of polymerisation in the cell wall casts some doubt on these concepts. It may be that monolignol transporters are exceptionally non-specific, or perhaps that monolignols are not exported by active transport whatsoever. Similarly, several peroxidase and laccase enzymes have been implicated in the dehydrogenation of monolignols [49]; however, these proteins are also apparently non-selective as non-canonical monomers are routinely incorporated. Alternatively, it may be that these monomers are not accepted directly and rely solely on radical transfer reactions to enter polymerisation. Although there are no obvious barriers for export, radical formation, and incorporation of non-canonical monomers into lignin polymers, these mechanisms represent underexploited avenues in lignin engineering.A number of potential alternative monomers has been proposed, many of which have overlapping functionalities in designer lignins [30 ].

        <p>Designer lignins invariably possess novel physicochemical properties that could potentially have adverse effects on plant physiology and development. Manipulations of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway have been known to produce plants with reduced growth, developmental defects, increased susceptibility to disease and water transport difficulties [29,50]. Although not all lignin-modified plants are compromised and such widespread pleiotropic phenotypes may not be purely a consequence of reduced lignin content or altered composition, it emphasises the biological importance of lignin in plants. In an effort to produce agronomically viable plants, broader plant metabolism should be considered and it may be prudent to use tissue-specific promoters to drive transgene expression. Spatiotemporal control may restrict designer lignins to xylem tissues, or xylem fibres more specifically [9]. Additionally, yield penalties could perhaps be overcome by vessel-specific complementation [51]. Given the diversity of lignin structures tolerated by plants in nature, there is every reason to believe that some 1c). In all of the models, units derived from lignin monomers are in cyan (G) and green (S), whereas novel units are coloured uniquely.Designer lignins invariably possess novel physicochemical properties that could potentially have adverse effects on plant physiology and development.

        <p>Lignin engineering has evolved beyond simple perturbations of the general phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways, culminating in a suite of designer lignins with novel physicochemical properties. Much like the Trojan horse used to covertly circumvent the wall defences of the ancient city of Troy, designer lignins may satisfy the biological requirement for lignin in plant cell walls while providing improved biomass utilisation efficiency. Moreover, high-value designer lignins have been conceived that could valorise lignin waste streams in biomass refineries, and could be targeted toward upgrading processing. Lignification shows remarkable plasticity, but the development of agronomically viable biomass feedstocks featuring designer lignins will require thoughtful selection of non-canonical monomers, validation in biomimetic systems, careful metabolic engineering, thorough assessment of pleiotropic effects that could potentially accrue from the incorporation of novel components, field trials, and the generation of sufficient volumes of material for industrially relevant bioconversion assessment. Although possibilities abound, maintaining plant health is paramount and, ultimately, the plants themselves will dictate which of these approaches can be tolerated. At the dawn of this new era in lignin engineering, we are limited only by the biological constraints of lignification and by our collective imagination.Lignin engineering has evolved beyond simple perturbations of the general phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways, culminating in a suite of designer lignins with novel physicochemical properties.

        <p>23. Ralph The authors report on the introduction into Arabidopsis of a newlydiscovered bacterial dehydrogenase that oxidises a-hydroxyl groups of lignin. Analysis of the transgenic plants revealed a modest increase in a-keto-b-O-4-units in lignin, despite challenges in apoplast targeting. As such linkages would be more chemically labile than typical a-hydroxyb-O-4-units, this approach may still hold promise in designer lignins. This study describes the role of subunits of the Mediator transcriptional coregulatory complex as homeostatic repressors of lignin biosynthesis. In parallel to the large body of work on transcription factors involved in transcriptional regulation, these findings emphasise the complexity of regulation in lignin biosynthesis. And as perturbation of Mediator genes in a c3 0 h mutant led to a recovery from the dwarfism phenotype but no change in the near-100% H-lignin composition, this study supports a view that plants can tolerate abnormal lignin composition provided the physiological demand for lignin is satisfied.23.
