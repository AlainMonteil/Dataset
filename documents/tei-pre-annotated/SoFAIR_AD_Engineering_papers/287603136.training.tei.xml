        <p>Abstract-This paper investigates the impact of power grid strength and phase-locked loop (PLL) parameters on small signal stability of grid-connected doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm. Modal analysis of the grid-connected DFIG wind turbine under different operating conditions and various power grid strengths are investigated at first. Modal analysis results reveal that the DFIG connected to a weak grid may easily lose stability under the heavy-duty operating conditions due to PLL oscillation. The object of this paper is to identify the PLL oscillation mechanism as well as influence factors and propose a damping solution for this oscillation mode. A simplified linear system model of the grid-connected DFIG wind turbine is proposed for analyzing the PLL oscillation. Through the complex torque coefficients method and using this model, the oscillation mechanism and influence factors including the power grid strength and the PLL parameters are identified. To suppress this PLL oscillation, a mixed H 2 /H ∞ robust damping controller is proposed and designed for the DFIG. Electromagnetic transient simulation results of both single-DFIG system and multiply-DFIG system verify the correctness of the analysis results and effectiveness of the proposed damping controller.Abstract-This paper investigates the impact of power grid strength and phase-locked loop (PLL) parameters on small signal stability of grid-connected doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm.

        <p>Pitch T HE increasing integration of wind power into the power system will weaken the power grid strength, and the short-circuit ratio (SCR) at the point of common coupling (PCC) of wind farm integration will become lower [1]- [3]. Hence, the wind farm is more sensitive to disturbances, which would deteriorate the stability of the wind power system [4]- [7]. Especially in the regions where wind energy is far away from the main power grid, like Northwest China, bulk wind energy is traveled thousands of kilometers to load centers via long transmission lines [8]. In recent years, several power oscillation accidents have occurred, which led to wind turbines tripping and caused the instability of power systems [9], [10].Pitch T HE increasing integration of wind power into the power system will weaken the power grid strength, and the short-circuit ratio (SCR) at the point of common coupling (PCC) of wind farm integration will become lower [1]- [3].

        <p>Unlike the low frequency oscillation with frequency ranging from 0.2Hz to 2.5Hz, the frequency of the wind power system oscillation ranges from several to dozens of Hz [11], which is within the frequency range of sub-synchronous oscillation. Thus, references [11]- [13] formed a set of methods based on frequency scan and the complex-damping-coefficient analysis to reveal the mechanism of these oscillations. Moreover, different control strategies are proposed to suppress such oscillations. However, the aforementioned investigations mainly focus on the power oscillations occurring in the system that wind power is delivered through series compensated or high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines [14]. They are not applicable to the conditions, in which wind power is exported via alternating current transmission lines without series compensation.Unlike the low frequency oscillation with frequency ranging from 0.2Hz to 2.5Hz, the frequency of the wind power system oscillation ranges from several to dozens of Hz [11], which is within the frequency range of sub-synchronous oscillation.

        <p>On the other hand, when wind power is delivered by a long-distance AC transmission line, the electrical connection between the wind farm and external power grid is weak. The power grid strength, which is used to describe the strength of the electrical connection between the wind farm and external power grid and parameterized by SCR at the PCC bus of the wind farm, may be very low. In some cases, the SCR at the PCC bus of the wind farm is even lower than 3, which satisfies the weak grid condition defined by the IEEE Transmission and Distribution Committee as SCR&lt;3 [15]. Therefore, there would be stability problems of the PLL-based voltage source converter (VSC) [16]- [19] connected to a weak grid. It has been found that the PLL plays an important role in the stability of grid-connected VSC, for example, the VSC-HVDC converter connected to a weak power grid [16]- [18] and Type 4 wind turbine (PMSG) connected to a weak grid [20], [21]. However, very few references take the PLL block as a main issue into consideration when the stability of the grid-connected DFIG wind farm is analyzed [22]. The power oscillation problem has threatened the stability of the wind integrated power system as the penetration level increases. And for the grid-connected DFIG based wind turbines, the power oscillations could be observed at the transmission line of wind integrated power system. Consequently, it is necessary to establish a detailed model of grid-connected DFIG wind turbines including the PLL block to analyze the oscillatory interactions between the wind farm and the grid.

        <p>In [23], [24], it is suggested that the impact of the PLL must be considered when the DFIG based wind farm integrates into a weak grid. During the process of the low voltage ride through of the wind farm, the coupling between the wind farm and the external AC power grid is weak because the voltage at the PCC bus is relatively low. When the dynamic characteristic of the PLL is considered, the loss of synchronism [25] and DC voltage oscillation [26], [27] will occur in some situations. Also, when the wind farm is connected into a weak grid under normal condition, it is reported in [28] that, when the PLL mode is poorly damped and its frequency falls into the frequency range of electromechanical oscillations, it would greatly participate in electromechanical modes. However, the cause of the controller-interfaced oscillation involving the PLL is not explained. By using the eigenvalue analysis, it can be found that the dynamic of the PLL oscillation mode will occur under serious condition if the line parameter is large enough [29], [30]. However, the oscillation mechanism of the PLL mode and how to improve the damping ratio of the PLL mode still need to be further investigated.In [23], [24], it is suggested that the impact of the PLL must be considered when the DFIG based wind farm integrates into a weak grid.

        <p>The linearization model of the PLL system can be represented as: If U p q = 0, the phase angle θ p obtained by the PLL is the same with the phase angle α of the input voltage, which realizes the phase tracking. However, when the external power system is weak, oscillation will occur at the PLL loop. The frequency calculated by the differential of θ p oscillates and deviates from 50 Hz.

The base power of the system is 100MVA. The base voltages of all buses are their rated voltages. The parameters of the DFIG could be found in [32]. Then this system is linearized at its equilibrium point, and modal analysis is conducted under different cases. Comparative studies are conducted when the DFIG is operated under the sub-synchronous state, the synchronous state, and the super-synchronous state, respectively. The influences of power grid strengths and PLL parameters are also investigated.

Mode 2 is mainly related to the two state variables of the PLL block, ω p and θ p . The participation factors of all states in the PLL mode are depicted in Fig. 4. Thus it is a PLL oscillation mode. The oscillation frequency of the PLL mode is about 12 Hz and its damping ratio is 48%. Mode 3 is related to the rotor speed ω r and the torsion angle θ s of the shaft, thus it is a mechanical oscillation mode.

By gradually increasing the length of transmission lines, the equivalent impedance Z w f will increase from 0.0218 + j0.0932 to 0.1134 + j0.4846, and then the SCR S tip will decrease from 5.2 to 1 accordingly. The changes of the eigenvalues of the above three concerned modes with S tip are shown in Fig. 5. It can be found that, the mechanical oscillation mode is mainly affected by the state variable θ s and ω r . The impact of the power grid strength on those two state variables is relatively small. Thus the damping ratio of the mechanical oscillation mode almost remains constant with the decrease of S tip . Whereas the damping ratio of the stator voltage oscillation mode increases slightly, the damping ratio of the PLL oscillation mode decreases significantly. Since the active power output of the DFIG is relatively small, the load of the transmission line is low.

Similar analysis results can be obtained. When S tip decreases, the eigenvalues of the mechanical oscillation mode almost has no change, whereas the damping ratio of the stator voltage oscillation mode increases slightly, and the damping ratio of the PLL oscillation mode decreases significantly.

        <p>As mentioned above, the DFIG connected to a weak grid may easily lose stability under the heavy-duty operating conditions. Thus, the DFIG based wind farm operated under the super-synchronous state is chosen to analyze the impact of PLL parameters on the oscillatory characteristic. Under such a scenario, the SCR at the PCC bus is 1.68 and the integral coefficient K I of the PLL is 333. When the proportional coefficient K P of the PLL increases from 20 to 100, the eigenvalues of the oscillation modes are shown in Fig. 8. Since the stator voltage oscillation mode and the mechanical oscillation mode are mainly dominated by the state variables E ′ d , E ′ q and ω r , θ s , both the two modes are almost unaffected by the PLL parameters. The eigenvalues of those two oscillation modes slightly change when K P increases. However, the parameters of the PLL have a significant impact on the PLL oscillation mode. The oscillation frequency of the PLL oscillation mode will increase when K P increases, and the damping ratio of this oscillation mode will decrease. If the proportional coefficient K P is too large, the PLL oscillation mode will lose stability. In summary, both the power grid strength and the operation state can influence the stability of grid-connected wind farm. Especially, the DFIG connected to a weak grid may easily lose stability under the heavy-duty operating conditions. Just like the low frequency oscillation of the conventional synchronous generator, power oscillation of the DFIG based wind farm will occur when bulk wind power delivered via long transmission lines. Thus, if a contingency happens and leads to the outage of one transmission line, the S tip of the power grid would become relatively low. Hence, the system is in the high risk of the oscillation caused by the PLL oscillation mode when the power output of the wind farm is high. Also, the stability of the PLL oscillation mode is affected by the PLL parameters. When the gain of the PLL is too high, the damping ratio of the PLL oscillation mode will become negative, and the oscillation of the wind power system may occur.As mentioned above, the DFIG connected to a weak grid may easily lose stability under the heavy-duty operating conditions. Thus, the DFIG based wind farm operated under the super-synchronous state is chosen to analyze the impact of PLL parameters on the oscillatory characteristic. Under such a scenario, the SCR at the PCC bus is 1.68 and the integral coefficient K I of the PLL is 333. When the proportional coefficient K P of the PLL increases from 20 to 100, the eigenvalues of the oscillation modes are shown in Fig. 8. Since the stator voltage oscillation mode and the mechanical oscillation mode are mainly dominated by the state variables E ′ d , E ′ q and ω r , θ s , both the two modes are almost unaffected by the PLL parameters. The eigenvalues of those two oscillation modes slightly change when K P increases. However, the parameters of the PLL have a significant impact on the PLL oscillation mode. The oscillation frequency of the PLL oscillation mode will increase when K P increases, and the damping ratio of this oscillation mode will decrease. If the proportional coefficient K P is too large, the PLL oscillation mode will lose stability. In summary, both the power grid strength and the operation state can influence the stability of grid-connected wind farm. Especially, the DFIG connected to a weak grid may easily lose stability under the heavy-duty operating conditions. Just like the low frequency oscillation of the conventional synchronous generator, power oscillation of the DFIG based wind farm will occur when bulk wind power delivered via long transmission lines. Thus, if a contingency happens and leads to the outage of one transmission line, the S tip of the power grid would become relatively low. Hence, the system is in the high risk of the oscillation caused by the PLL oscillation mode when the power output of the wind farm is high. Also, the stability of the PLL oscillation mode is affected by the PLL parameters. When the gain of the PLL is too high, the damping ratio of the PLL oscillation mode will become negative, and the oscillation of the wind power system may occur.</p>

        <p>From the eigenvalue analysis, it is found that the oscillation frequency of the PLL oscillation mode is 13.6 Hz.

        <p>As shown in Fig. 13, the phase angle of G PLL (s) will increase with the increase of K P in the low frequency range from 1 to 10 Hz. Thus, the increase of K P will improve the damping ratio of the oscillation mode in this frequency range. However, the frequency of the PLL mode is about 12 Hz. Even if the value of K P /K I changes significantly from 0.07 to 0.25, it has little impact on the phase angle of (K I + K P s)/K I in the high frequency range. As the gain of (K I + K P s)/K I will increase with the increasing of K P , the magnitude of the vector ∆U e will increase accordingly, leading to the increase of K D and K S . Thus, the oscillation frequency of the PLL mode will also increase. According to Fig. 13, it is easy to find that the phase margin of the PLL mode will decrease with the increase of the oscillation frequency. Thus the damping ratio of the PLL mode will decrease, and the wind power system will lose stability when the oscillation frequency exceeds a critical value.

The output power of the wind farm is 2 p.u., and is delivered through the double-circuit transmission lines. In this situation, the pre-fault S tip of the wind farm is about 2.5. One of the parallel transmission lines occurs a three-phase-to-ground fault at 3s and is switched off at 3.05s. Consequently, the post-fault S tip of the wind farm decreases to 1.38. The response of the voltage at PCC bus, the frequency deviation at the PCC bus, and the power output of the wind farm are shown in Figs. 16 and17. It can be found that the post-fault power output of the wind farm oscillates with the frequency about 10Hz.

This paper establishes a dynamic wind turbine model including the detailed characteristics of the PLL block to investigate the power oscillation of the grid-connected DFIG wind turbine. Modal analysis results indicate that the power oscillation phenomenon of the grid-connected DFIG wind turbine is closely related to the oscillation mode dominated by the state variables of PLL block, which is called PLL mode in this paper. Modal analysis results reveal that reason of the DFIG connected to a weak grid may easily lose stability under the heavy-duty operating conditions. A simplified linear system model of the grid-connected DFIG wind turbine is proposed for analyzing the PLL mode. The frequency response of the closed-loop system including PLL shows that the grid strength at the PCC bus mainly influences the phase characteristics, while the PLL parameters mainly influence the magnitude characteristics. Low grid strength or high gain in the control loops could reduce the damping ratio of the PLL oscillation mode. In order to suppress the power oscillation in PLL mode, a mixed H 2 /H ∞ robust damping controller is proposed and designed for grid-connected DFIG. The electromagnetic simulation results of both the single and multiply DFIG systems not only verify the analysis conclusions, but also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed mixed H 2 /H ∞ robust damping controller. Note that the proposed method can also be generalized to analyze and damp the oscillation phenomenon of the other renewable generation systems like grid-connected photovoltaic system, grid-connected PMSG system. The experimental validation will conducted in our future work.Fig. 19. The multiply grid-connected DFIG system grid-connected DFIG System. Moreover, the performance of system with the proposed MRDC is better than that of system with the PCDC. Therefore, both the frequency oscillation of the PCC voltage and the active power oscillations of wind farm will be quickly suppressed. In addition, the frequency response of the each wind turbine in WF A, the frequency response of WF B, rotor speed and active power of G2 under this situation without the damping controller are depicted in Fig. 21. It can be found that both the frequency deviation of WF B and rotor speed deviation of G2 are much less than the frequency deviation of WF A. Therefore, it can be concluded that the PLL mode oscillation is the inner oscillation in WF A and almost no interaction with the synchronous generator and other wind farm. This paper establishes a dynamic wind turbine model including the detailed characteristics of the PLL block to investigate the power oscillation of the grid-connected DFIG wind turbine. Modal analysis results indicate that the power oscillation phenomenon of the grid-connected DFIG wind turbine is closely related to the oscillation mode dominated by the state variables of PLL block, which is called PLL mode in this paper. Modal analysis results reveal that reason of the DFIG connected to a weak grid may easily lose stability under the heavy-duty operating conditions. A simplified linear system model of the grid-connected DFIG wind turbine is proposed for analyzing the PLL mode. The frequency response of the closed-loop system including PLL shows that the grid strength at the PCC bus mainly influences the phase characteristics, while the PLL parameters mainly influence the magnitude characteristics. Low grid strength or high gain in the control loops could reduce the damping ratio of the PLL oscillation mode. In order to suppress the power oscillation in PLL mode, a mixed H 2 /H ∞ robust damping controller is proposed and designed for grid-connected DFIG. The electromagnetic simulation results of both the single and multiply DFIG systems not only verify the analysis conclusions, but also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed mixed H 2 /H ∞ robust damping controller.
