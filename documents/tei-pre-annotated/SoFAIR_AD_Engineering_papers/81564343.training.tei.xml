        <p>This paper is the work of working group 3 of the RILEM Technical Committee on Hydration and Microstructure of Concrete with SCM (TC 238-SCM). The pore solution is an essential but often overlooked part of hydrated cements. The composition of the cement pore solution reflects the ongoing hydration processes and determines which solid phases are stable and may precipitate, and which phases are unstable and may dissolve. The study of the cement pore solution therefore contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms as well as of the kinetics of cement hydration. This paper reviews the impact of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) on the pore solution composition of blended cements. In a first part, the extraction and analysis methods of cement pore solutions are reviewed, leading to a set of practical guidelines and recommendations. In a second part, an extensive literature survey is used to document the effect of the addition of SCMs (blast furnace slag, fly ash and silica fume) on the pore solution. Finally, in a third part the collected literature data are compared to thermodynamic simulations. The performance and current limitations of thermodynamic modelling of blended cement hydration are demonstrated and discussed in view of future progress.This paper is the work of working group 3 of the RILEM Technical Committee on Hydration and Microstructure of Concrete with SCM (TC 238-SCM).

        <p>This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in combination with Portland cement (PC) by reviewing their impact on the liquid phase of cement paste. The composition of the aqueous phase of hydrating cementitious materials gives important insights into the chemical processes and the interactions between solid and liquid phases. The composition of the liquid phase determines which hydrate phases are stable and can thus (potentially) precipitate and vice versa. The measured composition of the pore solution and its change in composition during hydration can be considered in many cases as a prerequisite for a complete thermodynamic model of hydrating cements.This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in combination with Portland cement (PC) by reviewing their impact on the liquid phase of cement paste.

        <p>Numerous authors have investigated the pore solution of cement pastes under different conditions. In this review, an extensive literature survey was carried out and information on chemical composition of the components, the mixture proportions of the pastes and the concentrations of hydroxide ions, sodium, potassium, calcium, sulfate, silicon and aluminium in the pore solution were summarised in a database available as electronic supplementary source. Other authors have focussed on the concentrations of hydroxides and/or the sum of alkalis (Na ? K) in the pore solution in the context of alkali silica reaction (e.g., [43][44][45][46]). As stated in [47] pore solution analysis is very useful for understanding deleterious reactions and durability. This paper is not dealing with durability but with the reaction mechanisms of SCMs. The publications mentioned above were not included in the database because the information on pore solution composition is limited to alkalinity.Numerous authors have investigated the pore solution of cement pastes under different conditions.

        <p>In order to compare the general trends of the pore solution composition only the data measured between 20 and 23 °C are considered and the composition is restricted to pastes containing plain PCs and fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) or silica fume (SF).

        <p>The extraction, analysis and modelling of cement pore solutions should be carried out with caution. Next to paying attention to occupational hazards related to operating high-pressure extraction devices or to manipulating corrosive solutions, due care has to be taken to ensure the preservation of the extracted solution during handling and storage before analysis. In addition, the different measurement principles or sample preparation procedures for the regular analytical techniques can lead to slightly different values for elemental or ionic solution concentrations. In the following section guidelines to the extraction, analysis and interpretation of cement pore solutions are given based upon a review of reported procedures.The extraction, analysis and modelling of cement pore solutions should be carried out with caution.

        <p>During the first hours of hydration the liquid phase can be separated by vacuum filtration or centrifugation [48,49]. After hardening, pore solution can either be obtained from pastes prepared with extremely high w/c ratios [50][51][52][53][54] or by using a high pressure device to extract the pore solutions. Pore solution can also be obtained from mortars and concretes. Longuet et al. [18] were the first to describe such a high pressure device to extract pore solutions from hardened cement pastes.During the first hours of hydration the liquid phase can be separated by vacuum filtration or centrifugation [48,49].

        <p>As mentioned above only pore solutions of pastes with w/b \1.0 are considered in this paper. Therefore all the results at later ages are determined using high pressure devices. It has been argued that the expressed solution may not represent the real pore solution present in the hydrating cements (e.g., [55]). An increase of pressure could affect the composition of the solution. Some authors investigated the influence of pressure by applying different load stages on samples of the same composition and age. Duchesne and Be ´rube ´investigated pore solutions from PC and PC blended with slag or FA prepared with a w/c of 0.5 [57,58]. Tritthart used a w/c of 0.6 [59]. No significant influence of the pressure (up to 560 and 350 MPa, respectively) on the alkali, hydroxide and chloride concentrations was observed.As mentioned above only pore solutions of pastes with w/b \1.0 are considered in this paper.

        <p>However pore solutions from PC samples with w/c of 0.42 expelled at pressures up to 1000 MPa, showed an increase in alkali concentrations of 20-30 % at higher pressures [60]. Table 1 summarises results from [56] for pore solutions gained at pressures between 60 and 330 MPa (PC, w/c = 0.4). An increase in Na, K, and OH -concentration in the range of 4-9 % was found; a difference that is in the range of the variability of pore solution extraction data [59]. Also for silicon only a slight increase of the concentrations with pressure is observed. For sulfate, however, a clear increase of the measured concentrations with increasing pressure is found.However pore solutions from PC samples with w/c of 0.42 expelled at pressures up to 1000 MPa, showed an increase in alkali concentrations of 20-30 % at higher pressures [60].

        <p>These data indicate that the concentrations expelled with pressures up to approx. 250 MPa are comparable to each other, even though sulfate concentrations increase slightly with the pressure applied. At higher pressures ([250 MPa), however, the composition may differ significantly. The high pressures applied to expel the pore solutions could be the cause of this concentration increase, as high pressures could increase the solubility of solids. For the collection of an adequate amount of pore solution for the analysis from cement pastes a pressure of 250 MPa is usually sufficient. Higher pressures may be necessary for mortar or concrete.These data indicate that the concentrations expelled with pressures up to approx. 250 MPa are comparable to each other, even though sulfate concentrations increase slightly with the pressure applied.

        <p>Experimental details on how the pore solutions are handled after extraction are often not provided in the references. However, the first step is often a dilution to avoid the precipitation of solids within the solution before the measurements. Depending on the analytical method, the dilution should be at least 1:10. For analysis with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) the diluted samples have to be acidified immediately to a pH of about 1. The analysis should be completed within 14 days. For ion chromatography (IC) analysis the samples are not acidified but only diluted. To avoid precipitation the solutions should be analysed within a few days. Prior to analysis the pore solution should be stored at 5 ± 2 °C. Table 2 summarises the methods described in literature. Recommendations and comments are given in the last column. It is recommended to analyse at least the main ions (OH -, Na, K, Ca, sulfur) and to check the ionic balance. Very high discrepancies ([20 %) between anions and cations indicate the presence of high concentrations of other ions or analytical problems. Pore solution samples with high imbalance were excluded from the database. Some authors calculate the pH-value from the hydroxide concentrations or vice versa (e.g., [3,21]). Figure 1 shows the pH-value calculated according to Eq. 1 from hydroxide concentrations obtained by titrations plotted against the directly measured pHvalue for different binder compositions. The pH values calculated from the titrations tend to overestimate the measured pH-values, as titration results include also hydroxides present as dissolved complexes such as KOH 0 or CaOH ? .Experimental details on how the pore solutions are handled after extraction are often not provided in the references.

        <p>Thermodynamic modelling is used to calculate the effect of the quantity of SCMs on the pore solution composition and the hydrate assemblage; the results are compared with experimental data from the literature. The chemical composition of the PC, FA and SF used in the calculations is compiled in the Chap. 4, [18]. The preparation of hydroxide standard solutions offers in addition the possibility to mix in the appropriate concentration of NaOH or LiOH and to account in that way for the alkali error [61].Thermodynamic modelling is used to calculate the effect of the quantity of SCMs on the pore solution composition and the hydrate assemblage; the results are compared with experimental data from the literature.

        <p>(The presence of Li ? and to a lesser extent also of Na ? can lead to an overestimation of the H ? concentration and thus to too low pH values IC and ICP-OES are the most common methods. Generally the sulfate concentrations determined by IC agree with the total sulfur concentrations from ICP-OES [17], with the notable exception of cements containing slags, where reduced sulfur species such as HS -are present. For slag containing cements the pore solutions should not be acidified to avoid the evaporation of gaseous H 2 S and SO 2 . Details on the analysis of pore solution containing reduced sulfur species are given in [21]. An alternative could be the precipitation of sulfates with BaCl 2 . However the method seems to lead to overestimation of the dissolved sulfate concentration [24] and is not recommended.

        <p>ICP-OES AAS Since Si, Al, Mg and Fe are present at very low concentrations, it is important to report both the detection limit and the concentrations measured in blank solution. In case of Mg and Fe similar concentrations can often be observed in the blank solutions as in the pore solution [17,21], indicating that the measured values represent a background concentration in the blank and not significant values. Another difficulty of measuring these elements properly is the presence of high concentrations of alkalis and hydroxide, which can lead to salt precipitation during ICP measurement and possibly clogging. Appropriate standards containing comparable salt concentrations as the measured samples need to be used as the high alkali concentration can affect the background and as significant peak overlap might occur.ICP-OES AAS Since Si, Al, Mg and Fe are present at very low concentrations, it is important to report both the detection limit and the concentrations measured in blank solution.

Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations predict the composition of a system composed of aqueous, solid and gaseous phases at the temperature and pressure of interest. Thermodynamic calculations, however, are more than just an easy tool for calculations. They allow testing different concepts and prevent us from making assumptions that violate mass conservation. The comparison with experimental data enables us to validate the calculations as well as the underlying assumptions. Thermodynamic modelling was carried out using the Gibbs free energy minimization program

            <rs type="software">GEMS</rs> is a geochemical modelling code which computes equilibrium speciation of the dissolved species as well as the kind and amount of solids precipitated. Chemical interactions involving solids, solid solutions, aqueous electrolyte and gas phase are considered simultaneously. The thermodynamic data for aqueous species as well as for many solids were taken from the PSI-GEMS thermodynamic database [64,65], while the solubility products for cement minerals were taken from the cemdata07 database [66,67] completed with the recently determined solubility products of siliceous hydrogarnet [68] and the CSHQ model for C-S-H [59]. The CSHQ model as given in Kulik [69] calculates, based on an ideal solid solution between different end-members, compositions of the solid C-S-H from a Ca/Si = 0.67 to approximately Ca/Si = 1.6. Iron was assumed to precipitate in all cases as ferrihydrite. The formation of the siliceous hydrogarnet and thaumasite was excluded due to kinetic reasons [68,70]. To model the uptake of alkali by C-S-H an ideal solid solution model between C-S-H and two hypothetical alkali silicate hydrates ([(KOH) 2.5 SiO 2 H 2 O] 0.2 and [(NaOH) 2.5 SiO 2 H 2 O] 0.2 ) [24] were used as proposed by Kulik et al. [71].

        <p>Thermodynamic modelling was carried out in a manner similar to that developed previously for PC and blended cements [21,24,25]. The kind and amount of hydrates formed during the hydration of the PCs and the blended cements were calculated by assuming complete reaction of the PC and a limited reaction of the SCM, as the SCM react more slowly than PC [72]. The degree of reaction (DoR) of FA and SF has been estimated based on literature data. The DoR of the FA has been evaluated by using data from different class F FAs [10, 39, 73 and 74] (see Fig. 2). Although different class F FAs have been used in these studies, they show comparable reactivity. The DoR of the FA decreased with increasing replacement ratio. Therefore, a linear function has been used to describe the DoR at ages of 28 days as well as 12 years. SF showed generally a higher DoR and a DoR of 60 % was used for 28 days and of 80 % after 1 year [25,[75][76][77].Thermodynamic modelling was carried out in a manner similar to that developed previously for PC and blended cements [21,24,25].

        <p>The cement pore solution composition varies over time. In this section the impact of SCMs on the cement pore solution behaviour over time is documented by an extensive literature review. First the trends in ionic concentrations in plain PC pore solutions are described statistically. Next, the established trends are compared to reported pore solution compositions of cements blended with GGBS, FA and SF and the impact of the SCMs is interpreted and discussed. The discussion is limited to cement pastes of w/b ratios of 0.4-0.5 for alkali and hydroxide concentrations and to cement pastes of w/ b ratios\1 for total Ca, S, Al and Si concentrations.The cement pore solution composition varies over time.

For each element or ion the data at approximately the same hydration time were grouped together and their statistical distribution function analysed. Most of the datasets fit to a log-normal distribution. The mean value and the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles were calculated for each set of data according to this statistical distribution. The values for the different time plots were fitted with several polynomial functions to get a curve for the mean concentration and a range with 95 % of all measured concentrations.

        <p>Alkali sulfate phases contained in the cement dissolve within the first minutes when water is added. Due to the consumption of water during the hydration process and also a release of alkalis incorporated into clinker phases the alkali concentration increases over time, although a part of the alkalis is bound in C-S-H [21,78]. After 10 days only minor changes are observed.Alkali sulfate phases contained in the cement dissolve within the first minutes when water is added.

The higher the alkali (and the lower the sulfate) concentration, the higher the hydroxide concentration, as the pore solutions are charge balanced. At later ages ([1 day) sulfate concentrations are low and thus alkali concentrations are the main factor responsible for the hydroxide concentration. Figure 7 thus shows a more distinct increase of the hydroxide concentrations with time than observed for potassium or sodium.The concentrations of OH -in the pore solution depend on the alkali concentrations and thus on the w/c ratio (compare Figs. 4, 5), higher w/c ratio dilute the alkali concentrations.

        <p>The calcium concentration is determined by the solubility of portlandite and thus decreases with increasing pH or OH -concentration through the common ion effect. The same trend was found in [79]. The data follow in general the trend indicated by the portlandite solubility (see Fig. 9). However, many of the measured concentrations are above the calculated portlandite solubility and a significant scatter is observed. The scatter is probably related to the different measurement methods to determine hydroxide, sulfate and calcium concentrations. In the presence of high sulfate concentrations higher calcium concentrations are expected due to the formation of aqueous CaSO 0 4 complexes. As observed previously, the pore solutions tend to be oversaturated with respect to portlandite especially at early ages. Some authors state that higher pH-values give rise to higher sulfate concentrations [20,21,23,30,54,[80][81][82]. Figure 10The calcium concentration is determined by the solubility of portlandite and thus decreases with increasing pH or OH -concentration through the common ion effect. The same trend was found in [79]. The data follow in general the trend indicated by the portlandite solubility (see Fig. 9). However, many of the measured concentrations are above the calculated portlandite solubility and a significant scatter is observed.

The remaining data points were analysed in the same way as for sulfate and calcium, since the concentrations do not depend significantly on w/c ratio (Fig. 11).

        <p>The calcium concentrations in the pore solution of GGBS blends are shown in Fig. 13. No significant difference compared to pure CEM I pastes is observed even for high slag contents. Most of the results from the database for sulfate/sulfur in the pore solution of binders with GGBS were obtained with IC. This method measures the sulfate concentration (see Fig. 14,left). Due to the other sulfur species present in the pore solution of slag cements, the molar concentration of sulfur S tot as determined by ICP-OES can be higher than the sulfate concentration especially at later ages [24], as in addition to sulfate also thiosulfate can be present (as the solutions are generally acidified before ICP-OES measurements, the volatile sulfur species H 2 S, SO 2 and SO 3 evaporate before the measurement). In addition, storage times can lead to oxidation of the reduced sulfur species. Therefore literature results for sulfate and total sulfur may not always represent the original concentrations. The available data for slag cements show no significant difference between sulfate and total sulfur (see Fig. 14). Detailed investigations of the different sulfur species in [24] showed that at later ages (C56 days) only 20-30 % of the total sulfur is in the form of sulfate (these results are for a ternary blend with nanosilica and are therefore not included in Fig. 14). are in the same range as for pure CEM I pastes. For later ages no data is available. In summary, the presence of GGBS slightly lowers the alkali concentration and pH-values of the pore solution, that can lead to the presence of reduced sulfur species [21]. High amounts of GGBS ([75 wt% of the binder) can have a strong influence on the alkalinity.

With increasing FA replacement the alkali concentrations in the pore solution decrease continuously. This trend to lower alkali concentration is accentuated during hydration, as the alkalis which are released from the dissolving FA are bound to the reaction products.

        <p>The blending of PC with SF lowers the alkali and hydroxide concentrations in the pore solution significantly (see Fig. 21). The strong pozzolanic reaction increases the amount of C-S-H formed and leads to the formation of C-S-H phases with lower Ca/ Si ratio. These C-S-H phases take up more alkalis [78,83]. Due to the higher reaction degree of SF compared to FA and the higher silicon content, the reduction of alkalis is much stronger than for FA (compare Fig. 16). At very high SF replacement levels portlandite is completely consumed, low Ca/Si C-S-H is present and more alkalis are bound [5,74].

        <p>In contrast to studies on synthetic C-S-H phases where the presence of low Ca/Si C-S-H generally results in high silicon and low calcium concentrations, the situation in cements is complicated by the presence of alkali ions. The formation of low Ca/Si C-S-H lowers the alkali concentration and thus the pH of the pore solution. The solubility product of C-S-H for the reaction shown in Eq. 3, from [69] for low Ca/Si C-S-H indicates that a decrease of the hydroxide concentration is expected to lead to an increase of calcium and/or silicon concentration.In contrast to studies on synthetic C-S-H phases where the presence of low Ca/Si C-S-H generally results in high silicon and low calcium concentrations, the situation in cements is complicated by the presence of alkali ions.

        <p>The thermodynamic modelling predicts less portlandite if PC is replaced by FA, and above 40 wt% of FA the absence of portlandite and the formation of C-S-H with lower Ca/Si ratio as illustrated by the increasing fractions of the more Si-rich C-S-H endmembers in Fig. 25 Fig. 17 Potassium and sodium concentrations in the pore solution after 7 and 365 days of hydration depending on the total content of K 2 O and Na 2 O, respectively [3,10,11,15,19,26,27,31,32,39,40,42] and lowering of the portlandite content is observed but not a complete depletion of portlandite [10,39,74] even after 12 years of hydration. The resilience of portlandite in hydrating FA-PC blends has been explained by the inhomogeneity of the microstructure and the lack of water. These changes in the solid phase composition are mirrored in the calculated decrease of calcium concentrations at higher replacement ratios, which agrees well with the experimental data both after 1-3 months and after 12 years.

        <p>The modelled trends show a good agreement with the available experimental data from literature, especially considering the differences in materials and experimental methods. As mentioned before, the decrease in solution alkalinity with increasing SCM blending is well reproduced illustrating that alkali uptake into the C-S-H is at least qualitatively captured by the model. Apparently, Na concentrations are underestimated which is most likely due to systematically low reported Na 2 O levels in the raw materials and not to a deficiency in the model. The total content of Na 2 O is often determined with XRF and sodium tends to evaporate when preparing fused tablets for XRF [85]. In addition, considering the [3,10,39,42] scatter in Ca levels for the 0 % SF data, the model represents well the experimentally determined Ca concentrations. Also for Al, Si and sulfate the experimental data remain within one order of magnitude of the modelled concentration. However, as experimental data on Al, Si and sulfate are relatively scarce, it is not clear whether the observed remaining discrepancies are related to experimental scatter or to a shortcoming of the thermodynamic model used.The modelled trends show a good agreement with the available experimental data from literature, especially considering the differences in materials and experimental methods.

Reported experimental data on pore solution composition are collected in a database and variations in composition over time and between systems are statistically evaluated and described. The observed In contrast, blends with SF deviate from the thermodynamic model at high replacement ratios ([30 wt%) and low pore solution pH. Contradictory to the modelling results the experimental data indicate an increase of calcium and a decrease in sulfate concentrations. • Reported measured silicon and aluminium concentrations are few. Because of the low concentrations the scatter on the chemical analysis results is high and changes that might occur are difficult to detect. Therefore some of the very low measurements given in literature may not be reliable. The available data do not show changes in the silicon and aluminium concentrations of GGBS and SF blends compared to pure PC pastes, whilst for FA blends the aluminium concentration tends to increase over time and with an increasing replacement ratio. The latter observation is reproduced by thermodynamic modelling that predicts rising aluminium (and silicon) concentrations beyond portlandite depletion.This paper reviews and evaluates the impact of GGBS, FA and SF on the cement pore solution composition.

        <p>In general the comparison between experimental and modelled trends shows a good agreement, especially considering the differences in materials and experimental methods. Some discrepancies, such as noted for Ca and Si concentrations in low pH, high SF cements, indicate that the currently used C-S-H model can be improved further for non-standard conditions and mixes. In addition, not only potassium and sodium, but also many other ions including aluminium, iron, chloride, sulfate or carbonate can be taken up by the C-S-H phase, which was not considered in the present model. Low C-S-H Ca/Si ratios, as present in blended or alkali activated slag or FA systems, increase the uptake of Al in C-S-H [86] and decrease the uptake of sulfate [87]. More systematic experimental data on the uptake by C-S-H of other cations and anions as well as on their reciprocal influence are therefore welcomed to further improve our knowledge and predictions of the fate of these ions in hydrated cements.In general the comparison between experimental and modelled trends shows a good agreement, especially considering the differences in materials and experimental methods.

        <p>The effect of elevated temperature is also an important topic, especially for massive concrete structures. At the moment, only a few studies concerning this topic exist (e.g., [2,10,29]).The effect of elevated temperature is also an important topic, especially for massive concrete structures.
