        <p>The internet of things (IoT) manages a large infrastructure of web-enabled smart devices, small devices that use embedded systems, such as processors, sensors, and communication hardware to collect, send, and elaborate on data acquired from their environment. Thus, from a practical point of view, such devices are composed of power-efficient storage, scalable, and lightweight nodes needing power and batteries to operate. From the above reason, it appears clear that energy harvesting plays an important role in increasing the efficiency and lifetime of IoT devices. Moreover, from acquiring energy by the surrounding operational environment, energy harvesting is important to make the IoT device network more sustainable from the environmental point of view. Different state-of-the-art energy harvesters based on mechanical, aeroelastic, wind, solar, radiofrequency, and pyroelectric mechanisms are discussed in this review article. To reduce the power consumption of the batteries, a vital role is played by power management integrated circuits (PMICs), which help to enhance the system's life span. Moreover, PMICs from different manufacturers that provide power management to IoT devices have been discussed in this paper. Furthermore, the energy harvesting networks can expose themselves to prominent security issues putting the secrecy of the system to risk. These possible attacks are also discussed in this review article.The internet of things (IoT) manages a large infrastructure of web-enabled smart devices, small devices that use embedded systems, such as processors, sensors, and communication hardware to collect, send, and elaborate on data acquired from their environment.

        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT), also known as the Industrial Internet or the Internet of Everything, is an emerging technology that has enabled the interaction of global machine networks. For future technologies, IoT is playing a vital role as many industries are focusing on it. The importance of the IoT from an industrial point of view can be realized when the devices that are connected with the global machine network can interact with each other for the support system of the customers, intelligence applications for business, inventory systems for vendors as per their requirements, and can also perform analytics for business. Therefore, industries are rapidly adopting this technology for innovative technological solutions and competitive pressure [1,2].The Internet of Things (IoT), also known as the Industrial Internet or the Internet of Everything, is an emerging technology that has enabled the interaction of global machine networks.

        <p>Ashton, in 2009, introduced the concept of the IoT with the purpose of connecting radio frequency (RF) identifiers to the internet [3]. Currently, IoT is responsible for managing capillary networking infrastructure, representing a rather large number of wireless devices that can be connected to the internet [4,5]. There are four building blocks for the IoT devices: gateways, processors, actuators/sensors, and the applications. Processors act as the brain of the IoT system. They operate by processing the data fetched by the sensors. Gateways are responsible for transferring the processed data to a proper location. Bluetooth, WiFi, and low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) are the transport and communication standards for the IoT. Data are collected from its surroundings by sensors, whereas actuators/sensors give surrounding the processed data. The collected data have to be utilized by a proper application. The main applications of IoTs include traffic management, health care systems, environmental monitoring, and smart buildings. As the IoT is developing the wireless sensor nodes (WSNs), they have been applied to road traffic monitoring and environmental areas as well. For WSN devices the power sources are divided into two categories: renewable energy sources and nonrenewable energy sources. The renewable energy sources are thermal energy, mechanical energy, and radiant energy. Non-renewable energy sources are fuel cells and batteries. Renewable energy source harvesters possess the advantage of low volume, low weight, limited environmental impact, and long life. Among these energy sources, mechanical energy has been subdivided into the steady-state mechanical source, vibration, and intermittent mechanical sources [6]. Depending upon the vibration frequency, mass, and amplitude of the vibration source, the vibration energy can be extracted from it. The steady-state mechanical sources are water flow, and air currents. These sources are being used on a macro-scale for the generation of electrical power as in hydroelectric plants and on a small level. Intermittent mechanical sources might be cyclic in nature out of which the energy is available only for a part of the cycle. It includes the energy from human activities such as body motion and walking, or the vehicles passing over the energy harvesting device. Some environmental limitations make the replacement of batteries from WSN a difficult task. Besides this fact, batteries are very costly and also cause environmental pollution. Therefore, this urges researches to look for an alternative source of power. To harvest energy from the sustainable power supply, many sources such are mechanical motion, radiation, thermal gradient, and light can be used [7,8], which are usually renewable and clean sources of energy especially for WSN [9,10]. The limitation of the energy associated with WSN makes it a bottleneck for WSN technologies. To overcome this limitation on WSN, there is a requirement to explore an efficient harvesting system with high performance for the WSN environment. For this, the researchers are showing great interest. An ideal energy harvester is to provide constant energy which is a very complicated task and is very difficult to achieve. This can be optimized by the management and energy storage.Ashton, in 2009, introduced the concept of the IoT with the purpose of connecting radio frequency (RF) identifiers to the internet [3].

        <p>The process of conversion of ambient energy into electrical energy is known as Energy Harvesting (EH). Over the years, several techniques have been developed to utilize this concept for a number of different sources [13]. An EH system is a combination of several subsystems working in parallel, out of which power generation has a key role that is responsible for driving IoT devices. Energy harvesting for the low-power devices from sources like thermal, solar, wind, radiofrequency, sound, etc. has been performed efficiently over the last decade [13,14]. A workflow of energy harvesting based on light, temperature, motion, electromechanical, and electromagnetic field are shown in Figure 1.The process of conversion of ambient energy into electrical energy is known as Energy Harvesting (EH).

        <p>There are the two classes for energy harvesting architectures which is shown in Figures 3 and4.

        <p>If the energy is present in the surroundings, then this architecture harvests that energy and stores it for future use [15]. The said architecture is shown in Figure 3, where a photovoltaic (PV) cell is considered as an example for the energy conversion mechanism. As the energy is harvested from the surrounding energy, the storage elements such as supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries need to be selected depending on the environmental conditions. In some devices for the event of primary storage exhaust, the secondary storage can be used. An example of such type of harvesting architecture is the solar energy harvester. The harvester is composed of voltage regulator, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) converter, and photovoltaic cell. One voltage regulator is used for the charging of the batteries and the other one is used for constant power provision for the IoT devices.If the energy is present in the surroundings, then this architecture harvests that energy and stores it for future use [15].

        <p>The harvest-use architecture does not make use of the voltage converters and it eliminates the energy storage in the long-term; therefore, the disadvantages of the previous harvest technique are successfully removed [15], thereby reducing the device cost, potentially resulting in increasing the efficiency of the system.

        <p>A wide range of sensors is needed by IoTs for medical care, security, infrastructure monitoring, health monitoring, and environmental protection. Several issues involving batteries, such as costs, high maintenance, limited lifetime, and environmental issues, make them a poor solution for IoT [16][17][18]. Some IoT devices need to be self-powered to work continuously during their lifetime. Nanogenerators were made by the Wang group from 2006; these can convert small amounts of mechanical energy into electric current [19]. The very first nanogenerators were based on the triboelectrification and piezoelectric effect. In 2017, Wang et al. [20] presented the fundamental theory of nanogenerators starting from the Maxwell equations and discussed the similarities and differences between triboelectrification nanogenerators (TENG), piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG), and classical electromagnetic generator. Nanogenerator's major applications as presented by him are self-powered sensors, blue energy, and micro/nano-power source. Piezoelectric energy harvesters due to high conversion efficiency and simple configuration have been researched intensively. Lin et al. [21] used standard MEMSfabrication to develop a multi-cantilever piezoelectric generator. Magnetically assisted stencil printing (MASP) technique is reported by Medesi et al. [22] for multilayer ceramic devices fabrication. Nanofibers based on piezoelectric polymers are useful for various sensors and energy harvesting [23,24]. Wang group made an energy harvester with a biresonant structure of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films with two cantilevers [25]. This device, at a low operating frequency of 16 Hz, achieved 0.35 mW of power; an improvement in vibration-to-electricity efficiency of 40-81% was achieved. According to them, the biresonant piezoelectric PVDF energy harvester is capable of collecting more energy from random vibration sources. An energy harvester with PDMS/Ag/ZnO/Ag/PDMS layers was fabricated by the Balpande group [26]. Ag represents the plate electrodes and ZnO is a green piezoelectric material. The substrate was PDMS due to its low elastic modulus with capability of improving cantilever deflection. Good optical properties, biocompatibility, a better piezoelectric coupling coefficient, and low deposition temperature are the reasons for the selection of ZnO. 10.45 lW/mm 3 is the harvester's power density which is sufficient enough for the sensor nodes in WSN. Energy harvested from the undesirable mechanical vibration and abandoned heat can be used for low powered electronic devices [18,[27][28][29][30]. Conversion of energy from the ambient environment into electrical energy is known as the vibration energy harvesting (VEH). Chen et al. [31] proposed a system with a piezoelectric impact-induced vibration cantilever energy, high-efficiency power management circuit, and low power consumption. The harvester is promising for the conversion into high-frequency resonant output from low-frequency input which is generated from the passing vehicles over the speed bumps, to harvest low-frequency excitation. Commonly the energy harvesting is applied for micro-power sources but it can also be applied in the macro-power sources by means of the large harvester. With the help of a piezoelectric cantilever beam, an energy harvester was designed for the busy roadway by the Sung research group [32]. The main contribution of the piezoelectric energy harvesters towards MEMS in past three decades is represented in Figure 5 [33].A wide range of sensors is needed by IoTs for medical care, security, infrastructure monitoring, health monitoring, and environmental protection.

        <p>Forty-eight piezoelectric beam natural frequencies were tuned using road vibrational frequency and got the 736 lW power output and 8.19 mW/m 2 of power density. In the future, vibration energy can be used for street lamps, and for accident detection various sensors can be integrated with the street lamps. Using piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) vibration, motion capturing and acoustic energy can be converted into electrical output. Raindrop impact on the PEH was analyzed by Ilyas and Swingler [34] in 2015. They discovered that one impact can result in energy below 90 nJ with 2.5 lW of power for one harvester unit. Harvester's reliability is crucial before putting it for real situation use. MEMS electrostatic vibration energy harvesters shock reliability was improved by Fujita et al. [35] in 2014 with the shock-absorbing structures. A silicon mass-spring system was the base of the harvester. The reason for the failure of harvester under shock excitation was because of the impact between spring anchors. They introduced the shock-absorbing bumpers to improve shock resilience and to redirect the impact of the shock on the non-vital parts. Using various mechanical loads and under high cyclic electric fields, Wang's group, in 2009, examined the piezoelectric actuator's reliability [36].Forty-eight piezoelectric beam natural frequencies were tuned using road vibrational frequency and got the 736 lW power output and 8.19 mW/m 2 of power density.

        <p>The results showed by increasing the load cycles a monotonic decrease appeared in mechanical strain and charge density. This degradation was preload stress-dependent. Due to high stress or strain the macrofiber composite (MFC) fatigue failure for PEH was studied by Yang et al. [37]. The PEH under examination was made up of a cantilever beam and a patch at its fixed end made up of MFC. At high strain amplitude with 0.5 million cycles of testing, it was observed that there was a severe loss in the performance of the PEH. Voltage output degradation, natural frequency changes, and crack formation were the failures. A safe amplitude limit was said to 600 le for the reliable MFC performance. To meet the IoTs demands, portable self-power generation, and sustainable energy resources the triboelectric nanogenerators have been developed. Many researchers also focused on the harvesters for satellite structures, as in this way the harvested energy can power IoT devices to transmit the signal or data into the ground station. The piezoelectric harvesters are used for this purpose in reconnaissance satellites, as these types of satellites have a huge number of sensors. Therefore, energy harvesting is a critical and promising task in reconnaissance satellites to power IoT.

        <p>These harvesters have numerous applications in the field of aerospace engineering. The aerospace vehicle may stay away from the sun for months, that is why solar energy can not be a proper solution for this problem [43]. Conventional batteries have the disadvantage of being heavy and their maintenance cost is high and sometimes their maintenance is very difficult, i.e., in high altitude platforms [44,45]. That is why there is a need for a smart structure in the aerospace vehicle that can harvest energy by absorbing the energy from surrounding and can be utilized to power wireless sensors and can transmit data to the ground station via TTC subsystem [38].These harvesters have numerous applications in the field of aerospace engineering.

The achieved power output was 60.2 mW/m 2 and the maximal current density was 1.6 mA/m 2 . To scavenge noise energy a bistable acoustic energy harvester was reported by the Qin group [86]. Fabrication of harvester was based on a piezoelectric cantilever beam with a flat plate. Dynamic acting is produced due to the effect of the incident and reflecting sound waves that force back and front of plates to oscillate.

        <p>Wireless networks and devices which use energy harvesting are exposed to the attacks on different protocol stack layers. These attacks extend far beyond the eavesdropping and can risk the overall network availability, reliability, and dependability. The literature describes different attacks each with specific tools and technologies for the target. A summary of these attacks is given in Table 6. It shows the vulnerability and threats of corresponding attacks. The security in energy harvesting techniques is represented in Figure 8. Usually, radio frequency energy harvester networks contain no built-in mechanism for encryption, which compromises the information to the eavesdropping attack [155][156][157]. This radio frequency EH produces less energy compared to other EH sources, therefore these are not suitable for the encryption techniques. This is the motivation for the research products for the physical layer security to enable the data secrecy to some extent and application of a suitable technique of cryptography, especially for the devices with reduced availability of energy.Wireless networks and devices which use energy harvesting are exposed to the attacks on different protocol stack layers.

        <p>The simplest attack is the use of an energy-depletion attack to make the energy harvesting device believe the exhaust of energy. Therefore, the energy depletion attack in which a bogus packet is sent to the wireless powered by the adversary is considered as a form of denial of service [174]. To reject these packets devices needs to analyze the bogus packets and operations to do so requires energy thereby leading to the quick drain of the battery of the device. Therefore, no energy will be left to undergo further operations of networks node. 9.2.2. Flooding Attack Flooding attack is another example of DoS and in [158] the authors discussed it in detail. Several scenarios of adversary attack were considered such as (A) malware introduction to increase the transmission power of legitimate devices of WSN (this also increases the consumption of energy), (B) Increasing the noise on communication channel by using jamming techniques, it forces the transmission power increment for the nodes and therefore increasing the consumption energy. (C) Forcing the size of the re-transmitted packet to be increased by exploiting the weaknesses of some aggregation scheme of traffic.The simplest attack is the use of an energy-depletion attack to make the energy harvesting device believe the exhaust of energy.

        <p>The objective of energy and security are often in contrast. For approaching high secrecy rate a large amount of energy is required especially it should be higher than the optimal energy so required from source. This configuration becomes non-optimal for energy efficiency. A sub-optimal secrecy rate can be achieved if the harvesting energy is maximized and the power consumption on the source is minimized. Therefore hybrid security energy metrics have been introduced by [176][177][178] to the trade-off between the availability of energy and security. By considering the overall energy of the source from radio frequency energy harvester scenario, the network is configured in such a way that the trade-off is guaranteed at the same time the usability, reliability constraints, and network lifetime.The objective of energy and security are often in contrast.

        <p>Harvesting energy plays an important role in increasing the efficiency and lifetime of IoT devices. Energy harvesting systems have some limitations such as unavailability of the energy source from which energy is supposed to be harvested, low amount of harvested energy, inefficiency of the harvesting system, etc. To overcome these limitations, some efforts have been done and new models for harvesting energy have been formed which are discussed in this review concerning the energy source of the harvest. Energy can be harvested from different energy sources such as solar energy, wind energy, mechanical energy, radio frequency energy, and many others they are summarized in Table 7. In addition to other limitations, one of the critical problems arises with battery storage is power management. To reduce the power consumption of the batteries a vital role is played by power management integrated circuits, which helps to enhance the systems life span. PMICs from different manufacturers, that provide power management to IoT devices have been discussed in this paper. As the use of traditional battery comes with the disadvantage of a short lifetime, regular replacement, and environmental pollution. This limits the WSN's performance, its lifetime, and its capacity because of the regular replacement on the depletion of the battery. Furthermore, the presence of a hazardous environment and some specific sensors makes it very difficult to replace the battery. The advancement in the nanotechnology urges the self-powering source to make high performance nanosystems. At micro-and nano-levels, the energy harvesting is very promising technique, therefore management strategies and efficient energy storage have to be provided to sustain the power. Furthermore, the energy harvesting networks expose themselves to prominent security issues putting the secrecy of the system to risk.
