        <p>3D printing is a competitive manufacturing technology, which has opened up new possibilities for the fabrication of complex ceramic structures and customised parts. Extrusion-based technologies, also known as direct ink writing (DIW) or robocasting, are amongst the most used for ceramic materials. In them, the rheological properties of the ink play a crucial role, determining both the extrudability of the paste and the shape fidelity of the printed parts. However, comprehensive rheological studies of printable ceramic inks are scarce and may be difficult to understand for non-specialists. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the main types of ceramic ink formulations developed for DIW and a detailed description of the more relevant rheological tests for assessing the printability of ceramic pastes. Moreover, the key rheological parameters are identified and linked to printability aspects, including the values reported in the literature for different ink compositions.3D printing is a competitive manufacturing technology, which has opened up new possibilities for the fabrication of complex ceramic structures and customised parts.

        <p>Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an emerging manufacturing technology that enables the fabrication of geometrically complex structures with high resolution and minimum material waste, which is difficult to achieve by conventional methods such as casting and machining [1]. In this approach, 3D parts are built from computer-aided design (CAD) models by adding material layer by layer, which is why it is also called additive manufacturing (AM) [1].Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an emerging manufacturing technology that enables the fabrication of geometrically complex structures with high resolution and minimum material waste, which is difficult to achieve by conventional methods such as casting and machining [1].

        <p>Substantial advances have been made in recent years in AM, especially in the field of polymeric [2][3][4] and metallic materials [5,6]. However, the application of AM to ceramics is more challenging, due to its inherent high melting point [7]. In fact, the design and development of advanced ceramics by AM for high-performance applications is one of the most challenging tasks of modern engineering [8].Substantial advances have been made in recent years in AM, especially in the field of polymeric [2][3][4] and metallic materials [5,6].

        <p>Several methods have been proposed for 3D-printing of ceramic materials, which include: (i) Vat polymerisation, based on the layer by layer UV-light polymerisation of a photocurable liquid vat highly loaded with ceramic particles, trapping the ceramic powder within the cross-linked polymer network; (ii) Powder bed based methods, consisting in the layer by layer consolidation of a ceramic powder bed using different strategies, such as sintering local regions with a laser beam (Selective Laser Sintering -SLS), or spraying one or more binders from inkjets (Binder Jetting or 3D-Plotting); and (iii) Material extrusion, also known as Direct Ink Writing (DIW) or robocasting, based on the extrusion of a flowable ceramic paste or ink through a nozzle, and building a 3D part by stacking filaments (Fig. 1). Alternatively, the ceramic powder can be included in a filament of a thermoplastic polymer and processed by fused deposition modelling (FDM), where the extrusion is done using a heated nozzle that melts the polymer [9].Several methods have been proposed for 3D-printing of ceramic materials, which include: (i) Vat polymerisation, based on the layer by layer UV-light polymerisation of a photocurable liquid vat highly loaded with ceramic particles, trapping the ceramic powder within the cross-linked polymer network; (ii) Powder bed based methods, consisting in the layer by layer consolidation of a ceramic powder bed using different strategies, such as sintering local regions with a laser beam (Selective Laser Sintering -SLS), or spraying one or more binders from inkjets (Binder Jetting or 3D-Plotting); and (iii) Material extrusion, also known as Direct Ink Writing (DIW) or robocasting, based on the extrusion of a flowable ceramic paste or ink through a nozzle, and building a 3D part by stacking filaments (Fig. 1).

        <p>DIW offers the ability to rapidly fabricate complex structures of a wide range of ceramic materials at a relatively low cost, and is among the most used AM techniques for ceramic manufacturing in a variety of applications. The nozzles can vary greatly in size, ranging from nozzle diameters as small as 0.1 μm used in microfabrication [10] to nozzles as big as several dm for concrete printing in building applications [11,12].DIW offers the ability to rapidly fabricate complex structures of a wide range of ceramic materials at a relatively low cost, and is among the most used AM techniques for ceramic manufacturing in a variety of applications.

        <p>The design of the ink represents the most critical aspect of DIW.

        <p>The DIW printing process imposes stringent requirements on the rheological behaviour of the inks. On the one hand, the ink must be smoothly extruded through a narrow nozzle without clogging to form continuous filaments. On the other hand, after being extruded the filaments must be able to retain the shape of the nozzle, accurately reproduce the printing path and support layer stacking to avoid the collapsing of the 3D printed structure. In order words, the ink has to be extrudable, have shape-retention capacity and be self-supporting (Fig. 2).The DIW printing process imposes stringent requirements on the rheological behaviour of the inks.

        <p>As will be described in detail later, to fulfil these requirements ideally the DIW ink should behave like a fluid during the extrusion process, and exhibit an elastic behaviour once it is at rest and the applied stresses cease. Two main approaches have been undertaken to obtain ceramic inks that show this rheological behaviour, colloidal suspensions and gel-embedded suspensions, which include either hydrogel or organogel based suspensions (Fig. 3). Their main characteristics and distinguishing features are summarised below, and representative examples of ceramic ink formulations developed for various applications are displayed in Table 2.As will be described in detail later, to fulfil these requirements ideally the DIW ink should behave like a fluid during the extrusion process, and exhibit an elastic behaviour once it is at rest and the applied stresses cease.

        <p>Colloidal suspensions are highly concentrated slurries of ceramic particles (typically 40-50 vol.% or 60-80 wt.%) in a low-viscosity liquid, commonly water, and a small portion of organic additives (&lt;2 vol. % [53,54] or ≤ 1 wt.% [19,20]) that allow tuning the interaction forces between particles by electrostatic, steric or electrosteric mechanisms [7,27]. Polyelectrolyte species with amine or carboxylic groups, such as polyacrylate (PAA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyethyleneimine (PEI) have been commonly used to stabilize ceramic particles. Using an adequate solid loading and tailoring the interparticle interactions in the ceramic suspension it is possible to enable the extrusion process while ensuring the structural integrity of the ink after deposition, owing to a gelling process. Moreover, extrudability can be enhanced by the addition of dispersant or plastifying agents, such as cellulose-based polymers. The main drawback of this approach is that these inks may be very sensitive to variations on the chemistry and pH of the environment, making them unstable and difficult to control.Colloidal suspensions are highly concentrated slurries of ceramic particles (typically 40-50 vol.% or 60-80 wt.%) in a low-viscosity liquid, commonly water, and a small portion of organic additives (&lt;2 vol. % [53,54] or ≤ 1 wt.% [19,20]) that allow tuning the interaction forces between particles by electrostatic, steric or electrosteric mechanisms [7,27].

        <p>Gel-embedded suspensions have recently emerged as an alternative to colloidal suspensions for DIW applications. The main difference between them is that the rheological properties of gel-embedded suspensions do not derive directly from the particle-particle interactions, but from the properties of a gel phase where the particles are dispersed. This results in more stable suspensions, although it comes at the cost of reducing the solid loading of the inks. Hydrogels, such as those based on poloxamer 407 (Pluronic® F127) and cellulose, are the most usual choice due to their easy manipulation and the low volatility of water compared to other solvents. Although being less common, organogels (i. e., gels composed of a polymer dissolved in an organic solvent) are also explored in the literature [25,55]. Most of them rely on the liquid to solid transition through solvent evaporation just after the filament is deposited [56]. Different biopolymers have been studied such as poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polycaprolactone (PCL) (Table 2). Since the behaviour of gel-embedded suspensions is not based on the surface chemistry of the particles, this approach has the advantage of being potentially compatible with any ceramic powder [57].Gel-embedded suspensions have recently emerged as an alternative to colloidal suspensions for DIW applications.

This is often observed in quotidian products such as creams and paints, the viscosity of which is much higher at rest than when applying them onto a wall or skin, with a high shear rate. This is caused by the disruption of interactions within the fluid or the ordering of the molecules or particles in the direction of the flow from an initial disordered state at rest.

        <p>Besides the previously described dependence on shear rate, viscosity may also exhibit a dependence with the shearing time at a constant shear rate. In this respect, viscous materials can be classified into Newtonian, thixotropic or rheopectic. A newtonian fluid, like water, has a constant viscosity that is independent not only of the shear rate, but also of the sharing time. In contrast, when a constant shear stress is applied to a thixotropic fluid, the viscosity decreases with time, as a result of the progressive breakage of the internal attractive interactions by the continuous stress application [114]. This is frequently observed in quotidian products such as ketchup and yogurt that the longer they are shaken the lower the viscosity becomes. Finally, the opposite behaviour is found in rheopectic fluids, in which the viscosity increases with the time of application of the shear stress. This is a rather uncommon behaviour, shown by a limited number of fluids, such as gypsum and some lubricants, and is associated to shear-induced microstructural consolidation of the material [115]. The thixotropic and rheopectic effects can be reversed when the applied shear stress is decreased or removed, although it can require significant time to fully recover [114] Values in italics are self-calculations from the data provided in the respective article. a Related to the Binder. b Related to the solvent. c Related to the solids. d Related to the ceramic powder.

        <p>Many non-Newtonian fluids are viscoelastic, exhibiting a combination of elastic (solid-like) and viscous (fluid-like) behaviour. When a constant stress is applied, they suffer an instantaneous deformation as a result of the stretching of the interatomic or intermolecular bonds, but also a time-dependent deformation, as a result of the flow of atoms or molecules. When the stress is removed, only the elastic part of the total deformation is recovered instantaneously, followed by a progressive recovery over time of the viscous component, until an equilibrium state, which can be a complete recovery or not [110].Many non-Newtonian fluids are viscoelastic, exhibiting a combination of elastic (solid-like) and viscous (fluid-like) behaviour.

        <p>The design of a ceramic paste for DIW requires a fine tuning of the rheological properties, which must ensure, on one side, the appropriate flowability of the ink to be extruded through the nozzle and, on another side, a fast recovery of the solid-like behaviour which allows: a) an appropriate shape retention by the extruded filaments and b) a selfsupporting capacity by the printed structure. In the following section, after a brief description of the instruments used to characterise the rheological properties of the inks, we will identify the key rheological properties associated to these requirements, and describe the most relevant tests for their characterisation.The design of a ceramic paste for DIW requires a fine tuning of the rheological properties, which must ensure, on one side, the appropriate flowability of the ink to be extruded through the nozzle and, on another side, a fast recovery of the solid-like behaviour which allows: a) an appropriate shape retention by the extruded filaments and b) a selfsupporting capacity by the printed structure.

        <p>The shear rate dependence of viscosity can be determined by performing a flow sweep, a rotational test that applies an increasing shear rate and measures the evolution of viscosity (Fig. 7a). This test is frequently performed in the rheological characterisation of ceramic pastes for DIW. For an optimal measurement it is recommended to start at medium values of shear rate, above the flow point determined in the amplitude sweep test (as described in the next section) to minimize noise, going up until the maximum shear rate experienced by the ceramic paste while being extruded through the nozzle of the 3D printer (γ max ), which can be easily estimated by Eq. ( 9). Fig. 7b shows the outcomes of a flow sweep test for a 30 wt.% Puronic F127 hydrogel and the same hydrogel loaded with 50 wt.% of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) particles. When fitting the Oswald-de Waele Power Law Model (Eq. ( 2)), values of the flow behaviour index n of 0.042 ± 0.004 and 0.140 ± 0.026 and of the flow consistency parameter k of 837 ± 10 and 1051 ± 60 Pa⋅s n are obtained for the hydrogel and the ceramic paste respectively. These results reveal a strong shear-thinning behaviour in both cases, in agreement with previous studies on hydrogel-ceramic DIW inks [29,31,37,40,89,90,97], where n is always smaller than 1. Moreover, in most cases [31,37,40,89,97], the viscosity ranges between 100 and 1000 Pa⋅s when a shear rate of 10 1/s is applied. Moreover, increasing the ceramic loading has been shown to result in an increase of k, while n is hardly affected [31,40]. Regarding the rheological behaviour of the hydrogel alone, a study about Pluronic hydrogels has shown that an increase of the polymer concentration leads to an increase in the value of k and a decrease in the values of n [118]. A similar behaviour has been reported for organogel binders, although the information is more scarce: n is smaller than 1 in most cases [34,52,56,104,106], an increase in the ceramic loading affects mainly the value of k and a variation on the polymer content modifies both [106]. Overall, these results suggest that the shear-thinning behaviour in this type of inks is associated to the disruption and breakdown of the gel network, which acts as a carrier and governs the rheological properties of the paste above the flow point, and is almost unaffected by the ceramic content of the paste.The shear rate dependence of viscosity can be determined by performing a flow sweep, a rotational test that applies an increasing shear rate and measures the evolution of viscosity (Fig. 7a).

        <p>In contrast, the shear-thinning behaviour of concentrated colloidal inks is associated to the disruption of interparticle interactions [80]. As a consequence, it is strongly influenced not only by the solid volume fraction [38] and the particles shape and size [119], but also by the ceramic composition [58,76] and surface chemistry, the presence of a dispersant agent [45,65,72], the aging time [39], the pH [62] and the addition of viscosifying additives [38,73].In contrast, the shear-thinning behaviour of concentrated colloidal inks is associated to the disruption of interparticle interactions [80].

        <p>The viscoelastic properties are usually characterised by means of oscillatory tests. Specifically, the amplitude sweep test applies a sweep of increasing shear amplitudes at a constant frequency, which implies an increasing shear rate, and measures the evolution of the storage and loss moduli. Fig. 8 shows the outcome of an amplitude sweep of a 30 wt.% Pluronic F127 hydrogel and the same hydrogel loaded with 70 wt.% of β-TCP particles. In both graphs, three zones can be clearly distinguished. In the first one, known as the linear viscoelastic region (LVR), the storage modulus (G') remains constant and is larger than the loss modulus (G"). The shear stress increases linearly with the shear rate, which is associated to a solid-like behaviour with mainly elastic deformation. The value of G' in the LVR is equivalent to the elastic modulus of a solid material and it is known as G ' eq . Point 1 is the yield point, and the corresponding yield stress τ y is the value of the shear stress at the limit of the LVR, where G' starts decreasing, which is associated to the beginning of the break-down of the internal structure, leading to irreversible L. del-Mazo-Barbara and M.-P. Ginebra deformation. In the second region (grey shaded), between point 1 and point 2, the elastic behaviour still dominates over the viscous (G' &gt; G"), but the yield stress has been overcome, which points to a solid-like behaviour with irreversible deformation. Point 2 is the flow point, when G' equals to G", and represents the transition from solid-like to liquid-like behaviour, which is reached at the flow stress τ f .

        <p>Both the amount of ceramic load and the concentration of the hydrogel binder influence the viscoelastic parameters, as shown in Fig. 9, where the viscoelastic properties of pastes with different contents of β-TCP and Pluronic F127 are displayed. On the one hand, G ' eq increases significantly with the ceramic content and is otherwise little affected by the hydrogel concentration in the tested range, especially at high ceramic loads. A progressive reduction of the yield strain is also observed with the increase of ceramic content. The hydrogel concentration has no significant effect, except for the hydrogel-only inks and the pastes with the lowest ceramic load. In contrast, the flow strain is less affected by the ceramic fraction, tending to decrease with increasing ceramic content, whereas is more sensitive to the polymer concentration, especially at high ceramic content, increasing with the amount of polymer. Increasing the ceramic load produces an increase in the yield stress when a threshold of 60 or 65 wt.% is exceeded for polymer concentrations of 25 or 30 wt.% respectively. The effect of the polymer concentration is only observed below a 65 wt.% of ceramic and is more pronounced with the reduction of ceramic loading. Lastly, as expected, increasing the ceramic load results also in a gradual increase of the flow stress, which is also increased for higher hydrogel concentrations.Both the amount of ceramic load and the concentration of the hydrogel binder influence the viscoelastic parameters, as shown in Fig. 9, where the viscoelastic properties of pastes with different contents of β-TCP and Pluronic F127 are displayed.

        <p>When testing ceramic pastes for DIW, the amplitude sweep test is typically carried out at a frequency of 1 Hz, and it can be performed either controlling the shear strain [37,39,57,84,89,104] or stress [27,38,40,42,44,45,[50][51][52]54,59,73,75,80,122,123].

        <p>To sum up, the amplitude sweep provides crucial information to assess the printability of ceramic pastes, basically: i) the elastic modulus at rest (G' eq ); ii) the yield stress, when the material starts to deform plastically (τ y ); and iii) the flow stress, when the material starts to flow (τ f ). Regarding DIW requirements, a high yield stress together with a high elastic modulus minimizes the deformation of the ink once deposited and therefore, prevents the collapsing of the 3D-printed structure. On another hand, a small flow stress minimizes the stress required to force the extrusion of the ink through the nozzle. However, the two parameters are related and therefore a compromise is needed [124].To sum up, the amplitude sweep provides crucial information to assess the printability of ceramic pastes, basically: i) the elastic modulus at rest (G' eq ); ii) the yield stress, when the material starts to deform plastically (τ y ); and iii) the flow stress, when the material starts to flow (τ f ).

        <p>Another important aspect that has to be considered in order to achieve self-supporting 3D-structures with good shape fidelity is the transition kinetics from fluid-like flow to solid-like behaviour. A fast recovery is required for the printed paste to retain its shape, since it implies the restoration of the elastic behaviour and avoids the continuous flow of the ink immediately after being extruded as a filament [116]. This can be quantified by measuring the recovery of the shear moduli when there is a drastic decrease of the shear stress from values above the flow point to low, near-rest shear values.Another important aspect that has to be considered in order to achieve self-supporting 3D-structures with good shape fidelity is the transition kinetics from fluid-like flow to solid-like behaviour.

        <p>The rheological test that provides this information is the three interval thixotropy test (3ITT), which can be performed either in rotational or oscillatory modes, and allows mimicking an extrusion-based printing process by applying three consecutive steps with different shear rates (Fig. 10a andb): (1) a very small shear rate, within the LVR of the amplitude sweep, that simulates the rest state of the ink while advancing slowly through the 3D printing cartridge; (2) a very high shear rate, above the flow point and as close as possible to γmax , that mimics the extrusion process through the small nozzle; and (3) a very small shear rate again that simulates the rest state of the ink after being deposited. The final goal is to evaluate if the recovery of the solid-like behaviour is fast enough to retain the nozzle shape and if the restored modulus is high enough to ensure a good printing fidelity and the self-supporting capacity of the printed structure. Moreover, the second interval allows to study if the ink's viscosity is time-dependent (thixotropic and rheopectic effects), which would complicate the extrusion process, since the printing parameters, such as printing speed, would need to be continuously adjusted to preserve a constant flow of the material [116].The rheological test that provides this information is the three interval thixotropy test (3ITT), which can be performed either in rotational or oscillatory modes, and allows mimicking an extrusion-based printing process by applying three consecutive steps with different shear rates (Fig. 10a andb): (1) a very small shear rate, within the LVR of the amplitude sweep, that simulates the rest state of the ink while advancing slowly through the 3D printing cartridge; (2) a very high shear rate, above the flow point and as close as possible to γmax , that mimics the extrusion process through the small nozzle; and (3) a very small shear rate again that simulates the rest state of the ink after being deposited.

        <p>For the specific case of high laden ceramic pastes, this test or a part of itthe second and third intervals [89] or the last one alone [104] -is rarely performed in rotational mode due to the high shear rate required in the second interval, which can induce slipping problems when testing highly viscous materials. However, a viable alternative is to carry out the test in oscillatory mode, applying a shear strain or stress with constant amplitude and frequency in each step [57,84,90,97,125].

        <p>Fig. 10c shows the outcome of a 3ITT of a hydrogel ink with different ceramic contents (0/10/30/50/70 wt.%). In all cases the paste exhibits a solid-like behaviour (G' &gt; G") in the first interval, followed by a fast transition to a liquid-like behaviour (G' &lt; G") that only takes few second in the beginning of the second interval, and subsequently a fast recovery of the solid-like behaviour (G' &lt; G") that also takes few seconds when moving to the third interval. The higher the ceramic content the lower the percentage of the storage modulus from the first interval that is recovered in the third one. Specifically, whereas the 97 % of the storage modulus is recovered in the pristine hydrogel, this value falls to 90 %, 75 %, 52 % and 6 % with ceramic loadings of 10, 30, 50 and 70 wt.%, respectively. Moreover, for the most concentrated pastes (70 wt. %) a slight thixotropic effect is observed in the second interval, although the equilibrium is quickly reached. It must be noted that the decrease of storage modulus after extrusion does not necessarily imply that the ink is not adequate for DIW, as long as the final storage modulus is sufficient to retain the shape of the filament and support the printed structure. These results are in accordance with Nan et al., where the same hydrogel was laden with a ≈ 50 wt.% of aluminum particles [57]. In contrast, a complete recovery was achieved by Diloksumpan et al. when a 40 wt/v % Pluronic hydrogel was laden with 70 wt. % of CaP particles [97].

        <p>For colloidal pastes, Nan et al. proved that a small amount of polyethyleneimine (PEI) in a ≈ 76 wt.% suspension of titania increased significantly the storage modulus due to the flocculating effect of the cationic additive and induced a fast and complete elastic recovery owing to the electrostatic anionic-cationic interactions occurring in the ink. This fast and complete elastic recovery was a key feature in order to be able to 3D print free-standing pillars. Moreover, both the storage modulus and the elastic recovery was shown to be highly dependent on the concentration of PEI [57]. On the other hand, Chen et al. tested magnesium phosphate gels with thixotropic properties based on electrostatic interactions, showing that the solid-like behaviour of the inks was recovered immediately but there was a progressive increase of the storage modulus with time until reaching the original value [84].For colloidal pastes, Nan et al. proved that a small amount of polyethyleneimine (PEI) in a ≈ 76 wt.% suspension of titania increased significantly the storage modulus due to the flocculating effect of the cationic additive and induced a fast and complete elastic recovery owing to the electrostatic anionic-cationic interactions occurring in the ink.

        <p>Viscosity varies strongly with temperature because it is closely linked to molecular motion. Moreover, some materials experience temperature-dependent transitions resulting in drastic changes in viscosity, associated for instance to gelling processes or glass transitions in polymers. This is the case of some hydrogels commonly used as binders for ceramic inks, which undergo a reversible gelation process at a certain temperature. For example, Pluronic F127, a commercially available linear ABA triblock copolymer with A being poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and B poly(propylene oxide) (PPO). Below the gelation temperature, water is a good solvent for both PEO and PPO, but as the temperature increases, the hydrophobicity of the PPO increases and its solubility decreases, leading to the formation PPO-PEO core-shell micelles. At low concentrations these micelles are physically separated and do not interact, but above a certain concentration they organize themselves into a lattice and form a gel [126].Viscosity varies strongly with temperature because it is closely linked to molecular motion.

Below this temperature it behaves as a fluid (G''&gt;G') and above it has a solid-like behaviour (G'&gt;G'') (Fig. 11b). This transformation is also visible in the ceramic suspension, but less markedly due to the presence of the ceramic particles that mitigate the phenomenon. Moreover, whereas the gelation process induces a liquid-like to solid-like transition in the hydrogel, the ceramic paste has a solid-like behaviour over the whole range of temperatures. Therefore, this ink should be printed above this temperature in order to take advantage of the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogel at low shear rates, in order to maximize the shape-retention ability and self-supporting capacity.Fig. 11 illustrates the information provided by a temperature ramp either in rotational or in oscillatory mode, for a 30 wt.% Pluronic F127 hydrogel and for the same hydrogel loaded with 65 wt.% β -TCP particles.

        <p>Although the concept of good or poor printability seems rather intuitive and has been extensively used in the 3D-printing literature, there is a lack of consensus about the appropriate methodology to assess the printability of an ink [128]. In DIW the term printability encompasses two different concepts, namely: i) suitable extrudability; and ii) good shape-fidelity, both of the individual filaments and of the 3D-printed structure, also referred to as printing accuracy [116]. Both concepts are directly related to the rheological properties of the ink. Some rheological parameters can be considered as key predictors of printability aspects, as displayed in Table 3, and can be divided in two main groups:Although the concept of good or poor printability seems rather intuitive and has been extensively used in the 3D-printing literature, there is a lack of consensus about the appropriate methodology to assess the printability of an ink [128].

Both concepts are directly related to the rheological properties of the ink. Some rheological parameters can be considered as key predictors of printability aspects, as displayed in Table 3, and can be divided in two main groups:</p>
        <p>The first group is linked to the extrudability of an ink, and is composed by the flow stress (τ f ) and the flow behaviour index (n). The first parameter represents the minimum shear stress required to make the ink flow, which is related to the minimum force required by the 3Dprinter to extrude an ink, and the second one describes the flow behaviour of the material. A shear-thinning behaviour is desired, as it implies a smaller extrusion pressure at the same extrusion speed than a Newtonian or a shear-thickening material, and in fact printable ceramic inks have been shown to have n&lt;1, although a wide range of values has been reported (0.04-0.94). Values of τ f between 25 Pa and 5 kPa, although most of them in the range of 0.1-2 kPa have been reported.The first group is linked to the extrudability of an ink, and is composed by the flow stress (τ f ) and the flow behaviour index (n).

        <p>The second group is related to shape fidelity. It is important to note that, unlike when using polymeric materials, printing is not the final step when manufacturing ceramic parts by DIW. Most ceramic inks require post-printing treatments, which involve shrinkage, very significant in the case of sintering and minor in the case of reactive inks that harden by chemical bonding processes. These dimensional changes must be taken into account when designing the CAD model of the green parts, and the shape fidelity of the green part is a crucial aspect to ensure the accuracy of the whole process. To achieve it the paste must withstand both the gravitational forces and the surface tension after being extruded, as well as the shear stresses induced by printing the consecutive layers. This applies both to the individual filaments, which must retain the shape of the nozzle and not sag, and to the whole structure, which must be able to support layer stacking without deformation. The relevant parameters are the storage modulus at rest (G ' eq ), the damping factor (G''/G') and the yield stress (τ y ). G ' eq represents the elastic modulus of a solid material and, therefore, is linked to the stiffness at rest. Values from 1 to 10,000 kPa were reported for pintable ceramic inks, mostly in the range from 25 to 200 kPa. The damping factor allows to quickly screen the dominant behaviour of the ink at rest, either elastic (G''/G' &lt;1) or The minimum shear stress required to make the ink flow viscous (G''/G'&gt;1). However, it has hardly ever been used in the DIW ceramic literature and only values between 0.1 and 0.3 for printable inks were reported by M'Barki et al. [39]. τ y represents the maximum stress a material can support without suffering irreversible deformation and values between 10 Pa and 1.5 kPa were reported for printable ceramic inks, most commonly between 100 and 800 Pa. In this respect, Minas et al., based on their experimental data from emulsion inks, defined as a printability criterion for ceramic inks to meet the following conditions: G ' eq &gt; 2 kPa, and τ y &gt; 200 Pa (although it has to be noted that their definition of τ y corresponds to τ f in the present work) [54]. Although most of the printable ceramic pastes meet this criterion (Table 3), there are some exceptions. Thus, a boron carbide colloidal ink was reported to have G' eq around 1 kPa [45]. Other ink formulations were reported to have slightly smaller τ f , between 100 and 200 Pa [38,42,50,71,104] and there are also two cases of colloidal suspensions with significantly smaller τ f , in the range of 25-50 Pa [27,79].The second group is related to shape fidelity.

        <p>The characterisation of the thixotropy of the inks is also a relevant aspect that gives information on shape fidelity. This can be done through the three interval thixotropy test (3ITT). A fast recovery of the elastic properties just immediately after being extruded would ensure the retention of the nozzle shape by the filament. Although this has been little explored as a method to predict printability, Nan et al. [57] showed a direct relation between the kinetics of the elastic recovery and the capacity of the ink to retain its shape in very demanding conditions, e.g. when printing vertical pillars. Both the time required to recover the elastic behaviour and the percentage of the original value of G' eq recovered after deformation are relevant parameters provided by this test [57].The characterisation of the thixotropy of the inks is also a relevant aspect that gives information on shape fidelity.

        <p>However, it is important to bear in mind that shape fidelity, besides depending on the rheological properties of the ink, also depends on the design of the part and the printing parameters. In this context, Smay et al. [27] defined the minimum G ' eq required for printing spanning structures with a maximum deflection of 5 % of the nozzle diameter, taking into account the gravitational forces that have to be counteracted in order to prevent filament sagging (Eq. ( 12)) [27]However, it is important to bear in mind that shape fidelity, besides depending on the rheological properties of the ink, also depends on the design of the part and the printing parameters.

        <p>Another criterion was suggested by Barki et al. [39], taking into account the surface tension in addition to the gravitational forces. Thus, the post-extruded yield stress (known as dynamic yield stress τ Dyn y ) must be equal to or higher than the forces of gravity (ρgh) and surface tension (γ s R -1 ). Therefore, the figure of merit Ξ should be equal or higher than 1 (Eq. ( 13)) [39]Another criterion was suggested by Barki et al.

        <p>Alternatively, Feilden [129] defined a paste specific figure of merit ∅ (Eq. ( 14) [129]), based on minimizing the lateral deflection of the printed part as a result of the force that the nozzle imparts when the ink is deposited (Fig. 12a).Alternatively, Feilden [129] defined a paste specific figure of merit ∅ (Eq.

        <p>G ' eq τ f (14) The higher the value of ∅, the less the part is expected to deform due to the stresses it is subjected to during the printing process itself. There are some additional requirements for the yield stress, such as the need of a minimum yield stress to allow the part of a set height to be selfsupporting, and a maximum value that is dependent on the force that the printer can apply. This can be visualized by plotting G' eq vs τ f , as shown in Fig. 12b for different pastes compiled from the literature, showing that most of those declared printable by the respective authors had ∅ values greater than 20 [129].G ' eq τ f (14) The higher the value of ∅, the less the part is expected to deform due to the stresses it is subjected to during the printing process itself.

        <p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that different methods, complementary to the rheological characterisation, have been proposed to assess the printability of inks, based on shape fidelity. Most of them rely on visual inspection or image analysis, and are aimed at verifying the degree of dimensional accuracy of the printed object compared to the designed model. Its use is widespread in the bioprinting field, where hydrogel-based inks are typically used, but the concepts are valid also for ceramic-based inks. The focus can be either on the individual filaments or on the 3D-printed parts as a whole. Regarding single filaments, some relevant aspects include: (1) their geometry before and after being deposited on the previous layer, which should be continuous and uniform, with filament section close to the nozzle shape [116]; (2) filament sagging, that can be quantified by printing a single filament over a row of pillars separated by increasing distances and measuring the maximum deflection in the centre of each gap [130]; and (3) filament fusion, determined by printing parallel filaments with a stepwise widening of the spacing between them [130]. Some fusion is required to ensure adhesion between layers but too much may reduce shape-fidelity. Regarding 3D-printed structures as a whole, the final goal is to assess the geometrical deviation of the printed structure with respect to the computer design or a control [131][132][133][134][135], which can be quantified by the Shape Fidelity Scale [136] or the Pore Factor [133,134,[137][138][139].

        <p>A wide range of ceramic pastes have been developed so far as inks for microextrusion based 3D-printing to manufacture ceramic parts with complex geometries. The first generation of inks consisted mainly in highly loaded colloidal suspensions in a low-viscosity liquid, usually water, with a viscoelastic behaviour derived from the interparticle interactions, which are very sensitive to variations on the chemistry and pH of the environment. In recent years the liquid phase has been replaced by hydrogels or organogels, achieving more robust viscoelastic properties.A wide range of ceramic pastes have been developed so far as inks for microextrusion based 3D-printing to manufacture ceramic parts with complex geometries.

        <p>The DIW process imposes stringent requirements on the ink's rheological behaviour. Moreover, as applications become more sophisticated, such as 4D printing or patient personalized products, a more accurate control of the geometry is required. Hence the increasing demand for inks with excellent printability, which encompasses extrudability and shape fidelity. Often the development of ink formulations has been based on trial-and-error processes, which is highly inefficient and time-consuming, and has overlooked the rheological characterisation. A thorough characterisation of the key rheological parameters may provide very relevant information to understand the effect of different factors on printability and to address a rational design of ink formulations with better performance.The DIW process imposes stringent requirements on the ink's rheological behaviour.
