        <p>Organo-metal halide perovskites have recently obtained world-wide attention as promising solar cell materials. They have broad and strong light absorption along with excellent carrier transport properties which partially explain their record power conversion efficiencies above 22%. However, the basic understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms is still limited and there remain large discrepancies among reported transport characteristics of perovskite materials. Notably, the carrier mobility of perovskite samples either in thin films or within solar cells obtained using different techniques can vary by up to 7-8 orders of magnitude.Organo-metal halide perovskites have recently obtained world-wide attention as promising solar cell materials.

        <p>CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (denoted MAPbI 3 ) is the earliest and most studied metal halide perovskite in the context of solar energy conversion, yet it exhibits some fatal disadvantages including moisture, light and thermal instabilities and environmental concerns caused by lead. In order to solve these issues, alternative elements to Pb, various low-dimensional structures and well-ordered single crystals of perovskite materials and their devices with protective outer-layers have been widely investigated.

        <p>In the past few years, charge transport dynamics in perovskites has attracted enormous research attention by employing various techniques from laser spectroscopy to electrical measurement. Although some common photophysical features of perovskites such as low exciton binding energy, high charge mobility and long carrier diffusion length have become wellaccepted in the community, the quantification of charge carrier parameters remains a daunting task. One of the main reasons is the complexity of the perovskite samples themselves where the synthetic strategies, the film morphologies, and even the ambient atmosphere all play critical roles in charge transport.In the past few years, charge transport dynamics in perovskites has attracted enormous research attention by employing various techniques from laser spectroscopy to electrical measurement.

        <p>This leads to a large deviation of photophysical parameters---for instance, charge mobilities, lifetimes, diffusion lengths and diffusion coefficients-obtained from even the same experimental technique. The other reason is rarely mentioned or intentionally ignored: different techniques generate systematically distinctive results. For example, the carrier mobilities measured by diverse methods can be 7-8 orders of magnitude different for similar samples. It can highly confuse the readers who would doubt the validity of the results or even the capability of the techniques to truly rationalize the intrinsic properties of perovskite materials.This leads to a large deviation of photophysical parameters---for instance, charge mobilities, lifetimes, diffusion lengths and diffusion coefficients-obtained from even the same experimental technique.

        <p>2.1 Films without electrodes 2.1.1 Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. TA, also known as pump-probe spectroscopy, is a well-established technique to monitor the ultrafast dynamics of photo-induced processes in molecular or semiconductor systems. In brief, it involves excitation of the sample with a short (from a few femtoseconds to a few tens of picoseconds) laser pump pulse, followed by a weak time-delayed monochromatic or broadband white light continuum (WLC) probing pulse which measures the pump-induced absorption changes of the sample. This method can cover a very wide range of timescales (10 À13 -10 À4 s) and is sensitive to almost any photo-generated species (e.g., free charges, excitons, polarons, etc.) in perovskites. Yet, it also brings up a critical challenge to distinguish individual contributions of these species in the case of overlapping spectral features. In perovskite studies, TA is safe to independently analyse the photo-physics in relatively simple systems (e.g., single crystals, trap free films, etc.). However, when the system dynamics are complicated by multiple photo-physical processes and complex morphologies, additional information obtained using other techniques would be needed for constructing a unique kinetic model.2.1 Films without electrodes 2.1.1 Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy.

        <p>As depicted in Fig. 1A, a typical TA spectrum of MAPbI 3 after photo-excitation consists of two negative photobleach bands, termed PB1 and PB2, at 760 nm and 480 nm, respectively, and one broad positive excited state absorption band (namely, EA1) in-between in the visible region. It is widely accepted that PB1 corresponded to the state filling which blocked the optical transition from the valence band maximum (VBM) to the conduction band minimum (CBM) of perovskites. 2 An additional weak bleach tail at the red curve of PB1 was a characteristic feature of sub-band gap trap states. 3 The TA spectrum of the MAPbI 3 film in the near-infrared (IR) region exhibited broad non-structured absorption which is attributed to free carriers in the CB (EA2). In the IR region, the two bands at 900 and 1480 cm À1 with dispersive line-shapes were assigned to the Fano resonances between the vibrational transitions of the MA cation and the quasi-continuous intra-CB transition (Fig. 1B). 4 PB1 was correlated with the population of excited charges at the band edge. The decay time (t) of PB1 in the MAPbI 3 neat film strongly depended on the trap density of the film which varied by the synthetic methods (e.g., one-step or two-step solution and vapour deposition processes) and the resulting uniformity and crystallinity of the film. A wide range of lifetimes from hundreds of picoseconds to tens of nanoseconds can be found in the literature. 5 Remarkably, a mixed-halide MAPBI x Cl 1Àx film generally exhibited a much longer charge carrier lifetime (t 4 100 ns) because of its significantly smaller trap density. 6 In well-crystalized perovskite samples where surface recombination is dominant, TA kinetics can be well fitted by a onedimensional diffusion model to provide the diffusion coefficient (D) of photo-generated charge carriers. 7 By this means, the D value was calculated to be 0.27 cm 2 s À1 for MAPbBr 3 single crystals. On the other hand, by applying the spatial mapping in the TA measurement, the charge transport can be followed in real space, allowing direct evaluation of D. From such TA microscopy experiments, a D value of 0.05-0.08 cm 2 s À1 was achieved in an MAPbI 3 thin film. 8 D also depended on the trap density of the perovskite and differed from the values obtained using other techniques which will be discussed in the next section.As depicted in Fig. 1A, a typical TA spectrum of MAPbI 3 after photo-excitation consists of two negative photobleach bands, termed PB1 and PB2, at 760 nm and 480 nm, respectively, and one broad positive excited state absorption band (namely, EA1) in-between in the visible region.

        <p>The PL lifetimes of B10 ns in MAPbI 3 films and 4100 ns in MAPbI x Cl 3Àx films corresponded to the decay of the charge carrier population. [4][5][6] Modelling of the PL dynamics by onedimensional carrier diffusion, the consequent diffusion length (L D ) was estimated to be B100 nm for MAPbI 3 polycrystalline films with D = 0.017 cm 2 s À1 for electrons and 0.011 cm 2 s À1 for holes. 9 In mixed-halide MAPbI x Cl 3Àx films, the L D can reach 1 mm with D = 0.04-0.05 cm 2 s À1 . 10 The charge transport was proven to be more efficient in larger grain-sized films with D = 0.1-2.5 cm 2 s À1 . 11 This indicates that the carrier transport in perovskites is strongly modulated by trap density-especially by the surface/interface defect states. In addition, from the D values, the mobilities of minority carriers can be evaluated to be 10 À1 -10 À2 cm 2 V À1 s À1 . 11 Owing to a wide variety of detection configurations-for instance, photodiodes, streak cameras, or photomultiplier tube (PMT) set ups for up-conversion or single-photon counting-with different time and spatial resolutions (e.g., in PL microscopy) together with spectral responses, TRPL is one of the most popular tools for studying charge dynamics in perovskite materials. However, some non-radiative recombination kinetics in perovskites cannot be detected in TRPL.

        <p>2.1.3 Time-resolved terahertz absorption spectroscopy (TRTS). A terahertz (THz) wave with a photon energy in the 1-100 meV range can be responded by the low-energy excitations of photo-generated charges in terms of carrier generation, scattering and lattice vibrations. Therefore, TRTS can probe the photo-induced charge carrier dynamics in semiconductors where the transient alternating current (AC) conductivities can be extracted from the THz absorption. 13 In semiconductors, the dominant photo-induced species are mobile carriers, and the AC photoconductivity spectrum can be well described by the Drude model. Fig. 2A shows the typical frequency-dependent photoconductivity spectra of perovskite films where Drude-like line-shapes can be observed, indicating the formation of free charge carriers directly after photo-excitation. 14 The change in photo-conductivity (Ds) probed in TRTS can also be expressed as eqn (1):2.1.3 Time-resolved terahertz absorption spectroscopy (TRTS).

        <p>where DE exc is the change in the THz electric field transmitted through the sample after photo-excitation, while E gs is the transmitted THz electric field without excitation (i.e., in the ground state), e 0 is the permittivity of vacuum, c is the velocity of light, d is the sample thickness, and n 1 and n 2 refer to the refractive indexes of the medium (air) and the quartz substrate, respectively (n 1 = 1, n 2 = 1.5). The initial carrier mobility (m) can be calculated from the THz conductivity (Ds) as shown in eqn (2):where DE exc is the change in the THz electric field transmitted through the sample after photo-excitation, while E gs is the transmitted THz electric field without excitation (i.e., in the ground state), e 0 is the permittivity of vacuum, c is the velocity of light, d is the sample thickness, and n 1 and n 2 refer to the refractive indexes of the medium (air) and the quartz substrate, respectively (n 1 = 1, n 2 = 1.5).

        <p>where x is the quantum yield of charge generation, n exc is the excitation density, e 0 is the elementary charge. By combining eqn (1) and ( 2) and calculating the excitation density by the sample absorbance, m can be expressed as eqn (3): where F is the excitation fluence in ph per cm 2 per pulse and a is the absorption coefficient. The initial charge mobility extracted immediately after photoexcitation in perovskites was processed by the above described strategies and generally fell within the 1-100 cm 2 V À1 s À1 range with strong sample dependence. Taking lead iodide perovskite as an example, the mobility of an MAPbI 3 neat film was 35 cm 2 V À1 s À1 , 15 which was slightly higher than MAPbI 3 embedded within mesoporous Al 2 O 3 measured by both us (20 cm 2 V À1 s À1 ) 16 and other researchers (B8 cm 2 V À1 s À1 ). 17 In single crystals, a much higher charge mobility of 800 cm 2 V À1 s À1 was achieved. 13 Such deviation of carrier mobility may result from scattering from impurities or crystal boundaries varying in the above-mentioned forms of perovskites. On the other hand, the influence of the carrier density on charge mobility should not be neglected. The inter-carrier scattering might be enhanced with high charge density, which led to reduced mobility. 13 The THz field is always polarized perpendicular to the incident pulse propagation direction. Consequently, the charge mobility in TRTS reflects the carrier motion in the direction perpendicular to the THz beam. In this way, TRTS can discriminate between the contributions of the charge mobility in different spatial directions by varying the incident angle of the THz wave. Very recently, we used such angle-dependent TRTS measurements to obtain the charge mobility within different directions in emerging two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites (Fig. 2B andC), which are much more moistureresistant than traditional three-dimensional (3D) perovskites. 18 The angle-dependent photoconductivity in TRTS clearly manifested the preferential orientation of 2D perovskite sheets in (n-BA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 and (iso-BA) 2 (MA) 3 Pb 4 I 13 samples.where x is the quantum yield of charge generation, n exc is the excitation density, e 0 is the elementary charge.

        <p>In sum, TRTS that selectively monitors photoinduced free charge carriers with the capability of characterizing carrier mobilities is highly relevant for photovoltaic applications. It is a noncontact characterization method where the sample is not influenced by electrodes. However, it should be noted that the extraction of the charge mobilities in TRTS depends strongly on the theoretical model. In the bulk film of perovskites, the well-established Drude-like model is applicable. In nanostructured systems, however, the physically justified mathematical models for TRTS signals have yet to be fully rationalized.In sum, TRTS that selectively monitors photoinduced free charge carriers with the capability of characterizing carrier mobilities is highly relevant for photovoltaic applications.

        <p>where n e and n h are the populations of the mobile electrons and holes, respectively; m e and m h are the mobilities of electrons and holes, respectively; A is the sensitivity factor dependent on the microwave frequency and on the electrical conductivity of the sample. Given the lower frequency and longer apparatus response time, the TRMC method probes much slower timescales of dynamics than TRTS. The time-window of TRMC experiments is ns-ms, which is quite suitable for studying the charge carriers in perovskite materials (Fig. 2D). The initial TRMC measurements on the one-step prepared MAPbI 3 neat film and MAPbI 3 within mesoporous Al 2 O 3 scaffolds unveiled long-lived mobile carriers with lifetimes up to 1 ms. 16 The reported charge mobility (B3 cm 2 V À1 s À1 ) was somewhat lower than that in TRTS (B25 cm 2 V À1 s À1 ). Later studies revealed a strong sample dependence of the charge dynamics extracted from TRMC. In two-step fabricated MAPbI 3 neat films, the TRMC mobility (B20 cm 2 V À1 s À1 ) is analogous to the above-mentioned onestep fabricated samples. However, a much larger imbalance between electron and hole mobilities was found with m h /m e = 30. 20 A higher charge mobility of 30 cm 2 V À1 s À1 was measured in MAPbI x Cl 3Àx films with L D = 10 mm. 21 This was suggested to be facilitated by the lower trap densities. In a single crystal sample, by contrast, a much longer carrier lifetime (B15 ms) was observed with L D 4 50 mm. 22 This was again ascribed to a very low trap concentration, which was 2 orders of magnitude lower in single crystals than in polycrystalline films.where n e and n h are the populations of the mobile electrons and holes, respectively; m e and m h are the mobilities of electrons and holes, respectively; A is the sensitivity factor dependent on the microwave frequency and on the electrical conductivity of the sample. Given the lower frequency and longer apparatus response time, the TRMC method probes much slower timescales of dynamics than TRTS. The time-window of TRMC experiments is ns-ms, which is quite suitable for studying the charge carriers in perovskite materials (Fig. 2D). The initial TRMC measurements on the one-step prepared MAPbI 3 neat film and MAPbI 3 within mesoporous Al 2 O 3 scaffolds unveiled long-lived mobile carriers with lifetimes up to 1 ms. 16 The reported charge mobility (B3 cm 2 V À1 s À1 ) was somewhat lower than that in TRTS (B25 cm 2 V À1 s À1 ). Later studies revealed a strong sample dependence of the charge dynamics extracted from TRMC.

        <p>The SCLC method can also be utilized to investigate the impact of phase transition on the transport properties of perovskite single crystals. For example, the Yang group unveiled the distinct transport dynamics of the black a-phase (perovskite-type) and yellow d-phase (non-perovskite type) of FAPbI 3 single crystals grown by the liquid-based crystallization method. 38 By using SCLC measurements, a higher charge mobility (4.4 cm 2 V À1 s À1 ) and electrical conductivity (1.1 Â 10 À7 O À1 cm À1 ) yet a lower defect concentration (6.2 Â 10 11 cm À3 ) and free carrier (1.5 Â 10 11 cm À3 ) density can be obtained in the a-phase FAPbI 3 single crystals than the d-phase analogues.The SCLC method can also be utilized to investigate the impact of phase transition on the transport properties of perovskite single crystals.

        <p>However, all these above bulk perovskite single crystals are not suitable for practical device applications due to the absence of a substrate or undesirably large crystal size. In an early attempt, the Sargent and Bakr groups directly grew MAPbBr 3 single crystals on substrates to obtain highly crystalline films, which were termed planar-integrated single-crystal (ISC) perovskites (Fig. 7C). 39 By combination of the Hall effect and SCLC techniques, an ultrahigh charge mobility of 60 cm 2 V À1 s À1 , a low trap density of 2 Â 10 11 cm À3 and a high conductivity of 2 Â 10 À8 O À1 cm À1 were achieved (Fig. 7D).

This expression can be directly verified by excitation fluency dependent TRPL studies, revealing the linear or quadratic dependence of the initial PL (denoted PL 0 ) intensity on the excitation density (n 0 ) in different excitation regimes (Fig. 8A). 10 3.1.1 Trap mediated recombination. Under low excitation densities (o10 15 cm À3 ), including the conditions of working solar cells, the charge dynamics of perovskites mainly comprise both monomolecular trap-mediated and first-order geminate recombination, where the former contribution dominated owing to the long L D of the photo-generated charges in perovskites (Fig. 8A). 11 Therefore, the photovoltaic charge transport parameters revealed by spectroscopic studies are strongly influenced by the trap states. The dependences of trap densities on the PL lifetime have been systematically investigated (Fig. 8B-D). This includes (1) grain size (the PL lifetime of the MAPbI 3 polycrystalline films increased from 2 ns to 100 ns with an increment of grain sizes from o250 nm to 41 mm), 42 (2) chemical composition (the PL lifetime varied from 100 ns to 446 ns in MAPbBr 3Àx Cl x films), 43 and (3) interfacial phenomena (the metal oxide/perovskite interfaces, for instance, would change the intrinsic PL lifetime of the neat perovskite film). 44 3.1.2 Free carrier recombination and Auger recombination. When the excitation intensity is high (410 15 cm À3 ), the secondorder non-geminate recombination and the third-order Auger recombination become dominant in perovskite materials. The former involves the bimolecular recombination between two free charges, while the latter represents a three-body Auger process. Such higher-order charge recombination dynamics can be well observed by probing the excitation intensity dependent decay of time-resolved spectroscopy signals such as TA and TRMC. 19,21 Surprisingly, the second-order recombination rates of perovskites were found to be 2-5 orders of magnitude lower than the Langevin rate. 19,21 TRMC studies also revealed a generally low activation energy of tens of meV for the secondorder recombination. 41 This was conceived as one of the photophysical origins of the low charge recombination rates in perovskite materials.

        <p>Early studies by using TA disclosed the so-called hot-phonon bottleneck due to the substantial carrier re-absorption of optical phonons by carriers, which induces the slowing down in the cooling rate of hot charges in MAPbI 3 perovskites at high carrier densities. 40 Such a hot-phonon bottleneck is commonly observed in inorganic semiconductors, yet found to be much more pronounced in perovskites. This can be attributed to the decoupling between electrons and optical phonons due to the independent motion of organic cations or internal ferroelectricity in perovskites.Early studies by using TA disclosed the so-called hot-phonon bottleneck due to the substantial carrier re-absorption of optical phonons by carriers, which induces the slowing down in the cooling rate of hot charges in MAPbI 3 perovskites at high carrier densities. 40 Such a hot-phonon bottleneck is commonly observed in inorganic semiconductors, yet found to be much more pronounced in perovskites.

After photoexcitation, the interaction between the photogenerated charges and ionic lattices of the perovskite would induce long-range lattice deformation. Consequently, charges would be self-trapped within the lattice as polarons.

Further studies showed that the TA kinetics in perovskite/acceptor systems actually represented diffusioncoupled charge transfer processes where charge diffusion in perovskite occurred before interfacial charge transfer, where the timescale ranged from 200 ps to ns. Leng et al. summarized the TA kinetics of perovskite/acceptor systems with various thicknesses of perovskites and extracted the electron transfer time to PCBM as 6 ps and the hole transfer time to spiro-OMeTAD as 8 ps (Fig. 10). 47 The long L D prior to interfacial charge transfer can also be proven in TA in the IR range where the appearance of free charges in the acceptors can be identified as a broad IR absorption spectrum.Firstly, the additional depopulation pathway can be induced for excited states resulting in faster decay kinetics of the band edge bleaching PB1 in TA. 9 However, unexpected slower charge transfer times (4100 ps) were observed for perovskite/acceptor bilayer films using the TA technique those that of conventional photovoltaic materials (e.g., organic dyes, QDs, or semiconducting polymers) where the charge injection occurred within the sub-ps timescale.

Our studies of MAPbI 3 /mesoporous TiO 2 layers unraveled that electron injection processes were complete within 10 ps. 16 This was identified by a decrease of the initial charge mobility directly after photo-excitation in comparison to the neat perovskite in TRTS signals which featured the prompt depopulation of one species of charges either electrons or holes after charge transfer. From those studies, electron and hole mobilities can also be distinguished by considering that the TRTS mobility is a sum of both parts in the system, while the carrier mobility in the acceptors is usually orders of magnitudes lower than that in the perovskites which can be neglected in TRTS spectra.

        <p>Meanwhile, PCBM was widely reported to play an important role in passivating the interfacial trap states of perovskites. Despite that a few shallow traps were unavoidably left at the interface between MAPbI 3 and PCBM, the existence of PCBM intercalation often led to faster charge separation with suppressed recombination and hence higher mobility. 23 By Hall effect measurements, the PCBM layer was also found to efficiently passivate the traps of MAPbI 3 films, yielding a reduction of the intrinsic hole concentration and an increase of the Hall mobility of perovskites both by 3 times. 35 Compared to polycrystalline films, perovskite single crystals often exhibited much lower trap densities.

Although perovskites possess both organic and inorganic components, the photovoltaic behaviors such as the remarkably high charge mobility and dielectric constant render them more analogous to those of inorganic semiconductors. The strongest evidence is the observation of nondispersive charge transport in PSCs in the existence of either the PCBM layer or low temperature.On the other hand, different perovskite phases often exhibited distinct transport properties. By SCLC measurements, it was found that higher charge mobility yet lower defect densities can be obtained in a-phase FAPbI 3 single crystals than D-phase analogues. 38 This finding explained well why only a-phase FAPbI 3 based solar cells afforded high PCE.

        <p>Our recent studies directly confirmed the nondispersive charge transport in MAPbI 3 /PCBM bilayer solar cells at room temperature by observing a distinct plateau in both hole and electron TOF measurements (Fig. 11A). 28 This was distinctive from the dispersive transport among most organic solar cells, which originated often from the existence of disordered structures and deep-level traps. This result also well explained why perovskite solar cells outperformed organic counterparts, owing to the high crystallinity and large tolerance of trap states in perovskites. Similarly, by modified photo-CELIV, nondispersive electron transport was also observed in planar MAPbI 3 solar cells caused by the passivating function of PCBM, while dispersive electron transport was clearly observed in mesoporous perovskite devices due to the presence of traps at the TiO 2 / MAPbI 3 interface. 27 This work further emphasized the importance of the PCBM layer in achieving a nondispersive nature in perovskite devices.Our recent studies directly confirmed the nondispersive charge transport in MAPbI 3 /PCBM bilayer solar cells at room temperature by observing a distinct plateau in both hole and electron TOF measurements (Fig. 11A). 28 This was distinctive from the dispersive transport among most organic solar cells, which originated often from the existence of disordered structures and deep-level traps.

        <p>In the absence of the PCBM layer, by contrast, nondispersive charge transport can still be achieved by lowering the operating temperature. The conversion from dispersive to nondispersive charge transport at low temperature was unraveled by CELIV measurements of MAPbI 3 /spiro-OMeTAD bilayer solar cells. 24 This behavior resulted from the suppressed trap states caused by the disordered MA dipoles at low temperature.In the absence of the PCBM layer, by contrast, nondispersive charge transport can still be achieved by lowering the operating temperature.

        <p>As organic-inorganic hybrid materials, there also remains an uncertainty about whether hopping or band-like conduction dominates in PSCs. We found that the conduction pathway was determined by not only the perovskite phases, but also the fabrication process. For instance, we unveiled that hopping and band-like conduction individually dominated in the tetragonal and cubic phases of perovskites by applying the TOF method in two-step fabricated MAPbI 3 solar cells (Fig. 12A). 28 By contrast, in one-step fabricated MAPbI 3 solar cells, the charge mobility was gradually decreased with increasing temperature by utilizing temperature-dependent CELIV, indicative of the band-like conduction in perovskites (Fig. 12B). 23 By the Hall effect measurement for MAPbBr 3 single crystals, a band-like transport was also verified by observing higher charge mobility at lower temperature (Fig. 12C). 37 These results indicated that the conduction type was also related to the fabrication process.As organic-inorganic hybrid materials, there also remains an uncertainty about whether hopping or band-like conduction dominates in PSCs.

        <p>In addition, extremely low bimolecular recombination coefficients of 10 À11 -10 À10 cm 3 s À1 were found for vapor-and solution-grown MAPbI 3 films and MAPbBr 3 single crystals, which were comparable to those of the best direct-band inorganic semiconductors. 36 In addition, two orders of magnitude higher charge mobilities were observed in MAPbI 3 based FETs when the temperature was decreased below 200 K, suggesting phonon scattering-limited transport, which is similar to that of common inorganic semiconductors. 31 Therefore, all these reports verified the fact that perovskites prefer to exhibit the properties of inorganic semiconductors such as GaAs rather than the organic ones.In addition, extremely low bimolecular recombination coefficients of 10 À11 -10 À10 cm 3 s À1 were found for vapor-and solution-grown MAPbI 3 films and MAPbBr 3 single crystals, which were comparable to those of the best direct-band inorganic semiconductors. 36 In addition, two orders of magnitude higher charge mobilities were observed in MAPbI 3 based FETs when the temperature was decreased below 200 K, suggesting phonon scattering-limited transport, which is similar to that of common inorganic semiconductors. 31 Therefore, all these reports verified the fact that perovskites prefer to exhibit the properties of inorganic semiconductors such as GaAs rather than the organic ones.</p>
        <p>Although the above-mentioned techniques are all self-consistent in elucidating the photophysics in perovskite materials individually, the comparison among those techniques exhibits a large deviation. The most critical discrepancy stems from the values of carrier mobility as measured using different transportation methods, which cover a wide range of 8 orders of magnitude as summarized in Fig. 13A (see Table S1 in the ESI †). Generally speaking, the charge carrier mobilities in perovskites are dominated by intrinsic carrier-lattice interaction and extrinsic carrier-imperfection interaction of the materials. The former is dominated by the intrinsic electronic structures of the perovskites, while the latter reflects the charge carrier scattering by grain boundaries, dopants, lattice defects, etc. Putting aside the effect of sample variations including structures, morphologies, trap densities, etc., which are also reported to regulate the carrier mobility by one to two orders of magnitude, we can still classify the results obtained using different techniques into two categories-mobilities extracted using the CELIV and TOF methods are usually below the level of 10 À2 cm 2 V À1 s À1 , while the values measured using the other methods are orders of magnitude higher. Interestingly, we found that the mobilities of perovskite single crystals that were expected to be relatively defect-free, when measured in TOF, were within the same range as provided by the other methods (Fig. 13A). This indicates that the CELIV and TOF techniques are more sensitive to the long-range order of perovskites with significant contribution from the grain boundaries or interface phenomena. In contrast, other time-resolved or steady-state approaches are focused more on the local information of charge carriers.Although the above-mentioned techniques are all self-consistent in elucidating the photophysics in perovskite materials individually, the comparison among those techniques exhibits a large deviation.

        <p>Recent research efforts on the grain-size dependent mobilities in TRMC have already put forward similar concerns that the time scale of diffusive transport across grain boundaries in perovskites is much slower than the period of the microwave field (100 ps) which cannot be fully characterized. 48 In other words, pump-probe methods such as TRTS and TRMC tend to reflect the intrinsic capabilities of the charge transport dominated by the local acoustic photon scattering or electronphonon scattering. In contrast, methods like CELIV and TOF with contact electrodes characterize charge carriers that undergo the entire transport period across the film structure within a much longer time scale of ns-ms (Fig. 13B). In this regard, the carrier-defect scattering, as a bottleneck for charge transport, may dominate the characteristic charge mobilities. We consider it as one of the major origins for the deviation of charge mobilities obtained from those different methods. To further support this conclusion, we summarize the dependence of charge mobilities in MAPbI x Cl 3Àx polycrystalline films on the probing time-scale (defined as the time duration of the probe pulse) measured via different methods in the literature (Fig. 13C). An evident decrease of mobilities accompanied by an increase of the probing time-scale can be observed, which is consistent with our assumption. It should also be noted that in steady-state measurements (SCLC and Hall effect), the intergrain and cross-grain transportation of charge carriers can be well distinguished by modulating the applied voltage or magnetic field. Therefore, the charge mobilities extracted using those methods can still be close to those obtained using the TRTS and TRMC methods.Recent research efforts on the grain-size dependent mobilities in TRMC have already put forward similar concerns that the time scale of diffusive transport across grain boundaries in perovskites is much slower than the period of the microwave field (100 ps) which cannot be fully characterized. 48 In other words, pump-probe methods such as TRTS and TRMC tend to reflect the intrinsic capabilities of the charge transport dominated by the local acoustic photon scattering or electronphonon scattering.

        <p>Another crucial factor to be accounted for is the photoexcitation intensities, which also determine the carrier concentration in perovskites. According to classic semiconductor physics, the carrier mobility is reverse to the charge scattering rates (g). In principle, g would increase as a function of the carrier concentration in a semiconductor due to the increased carrier-carrier scattering, which leads to a reduction of charge mobility. 49 However, the summarized dependences between excitation intensities and mobilities measured via various techniques for perovskite materials exhibit the opposite trend (Fig. 13D). One plausible explanation is the dynamic trap filling process at high carrier densities, which diminishes the carrierdefect scattering of residual free carriers. Such trap filling has been widely observed in perovskite materials, indicating that the carrier concentration not only mediates the recombination mode of the photo-generated charges (i.e., first-order or higherorder charge recombination) but also determines the effective defect densities at excited states. 50 Besides that, the analysis methodologies of each technique would also result in a deviation of the output. As mentioned above, for instance, the analysis of AC conductivity in TRTS and TRMC required comprehensive physical models which may vary by the geometries of the samples and the experimental configurations. In addition, the possible lattice deformation at excited states by polaron formation or photo-induced ferroelectricity could also lead to different charge carrier dynamics measured between the dark state methods (e.g., FET, Hall effect) and the methods with light excitation.Another crucial factor to be accounted for is the photoexcitation intensities, which also determine the carrier concentration in perovskites.

        <p>There remains a long-standing debate concerning which method is more appropriate to rationalize the photo-physical origins of the superior photovoltaic performance of perovskite materials. The above comparisons suggest that various steady-state, transient and ultrafast techniques are indeed complementary to each other, at least in determining carrier mobilities. In brief, the capability of transporting photogenerated charge carriers is dominated by several scattering processes including (1) carrier-phonon, (2) carrier-carrier, (3) carrier-plasmon, and (4) carrier-impurity scattering. Different techniques presented in this review only characterize some of those processes depending on the above-mentioned transport parameters. Therefore, it is a risk to interpret the charge dynamics of perovskites by using one single technique without specifying the detection regime. In order to characterize the entire charge transport process within perovskites from charge photo-generation, separation to collection, a combination of multiple approaches is highly needed.There remains a long-standing debate concerning which method is more appropriate to rationalize the photo-physical origins of the superior photovoltaic performance of perovskite materials.

        <p>This review systematically introduced the charge transport dynamics of perovskites, which were investigated using various techniques including ultrafast spectroscopies (TA, TRPL, TRTS, TRMC), transient electrical measurements (CELIV, TOF), and steady-state methods (FET, Hall effect, SCLC). Followed by a brief introduction of each technique, we summarized representative results of perovskites in the literature obtained from those transportation methods in terms of carrier mobilities, lifetimes, diffusion lengths, etc. From these results, most of the critical charge carrier dynamics are gained in neat films, bilayer films and operating solar cells based on perovskites. In neat films, photo-generated species are predominantly contributed by free carriers which mainly undergo trap-assisted first-order recombination. In conjunction with the charge acceptor to form the bilayer films, the interfacial charge transfer is generally efficient within the picosecond time-scale. In real device configurations, the charge transport is non-dispersive and dominated by the band-like conduction which also exhibits large trap tolerance.This review systematically introduced the charge transport dynamics of perovskites, which were investigated using various techniques including ultrafast spectroscopies (TA, TRPL, TRTS, TRMC), transient electrical measurements (CELIV, TOF), and steady-state methods (FET, Hall effect, SCLC).

        <p>More importantly, we manifested the difference and limitation of each technique in the photo-physical studies of perovskite materials. We showed that due to various time windows and excitation levels, these techniques are sensitive to specific processes during charge transport. Ultrafast spectroscopies with high excitation concentrations and relatively short timewindows tend to probe the local charge carrier dynamics that are determined by the intrinsic structures of the perovskites, while transient electrical measurements with long timewindows and low excitation intensities detect the collective charge transport behaviors with large contribution from the grain boundaries and interface phenomena within the perovskites. We also emphasize the complementary points of view that integrate the different techniques to rationalize the solar cell performance using photo-physical studies.More importantly, we manifested the difference and limitation of each technique in the photo-physical studies of perovskite materials.
