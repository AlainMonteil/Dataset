        <p>Over the years, water pollution remediation has attracted global attention due to the continuous deterioration of the water quality as a result of the invasion by organic, inorganic and microbial pollutants [1]. Water is a potentially useful resource therefore availability of water is important for the continued existence of living things on earth. However, large quantities of pollutants are directly or indirectly introduced into freshwater water bodies</p>

        <p>where they render the water unsafe for day to day use [2,3]. Hydrogel based water purification systems have shown the potential as efficient adsorbents because of their threedimensional network of polymeric chains and hydrophilic nature [4]. Moreover, hydrogel materials are more advantageous because they are cheap, non-toxic, chemically and physically stable, have a flexible polymeric network and good reusability [4,5]. The flexible polymeric network supports the swelling property of the hydrogel enabling it to hold a considerable amount of water without dissolving [6]. Many chemical and physical methods like adsorption, chemical oxidation and reduction, biological treatment and photocatalytic degradation have been used for wastewater remediation [7]. However, the adsorption method is a favourable physical method for wastewater treatment owing to its cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness, among other advantages [8].</p>
        <p>Sodium alginate (NaA) is a pH sensitive, non-toxic, biodegradable, natural, anionic polymer formed of two basic units: α-L-guluronic acid (G-block) and β-D-mannuronic acid (M-block) [9,10]. Alginate has been mainly used in the pharmaceutical, medical and food industries, therefore alginate based adsorbents in water treatment have shown pronounced concern by reason of their biocompatibility and non-toxic nature [11][12][13].</p>
        <p>Graphite has a 3D layered structure of graphene sheets stacked together and held by weak van der Waals forces and is often used as the source material for other modified carbon forms including graphene, graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide and graphite oxide [14][15][16].</p>
        <p>Graphite and its derivatives show good chemical properties, thermal stability and mechanical strength. So these properties of graphite making it an ideal material for improving the stability of hydrogel composite [17,18]. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the removal of cationic and anionic dye pollutants [18]. These studies have demonstrated the positive effect of incorporating the carbon materials in the hydrogel composite for adsorption of various pollutants.</p>
        <p>Malachite green dye is an organic cationic dye (Figure S1) that is widely used in the textile and paper industries [21,22]. Generally, the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions is a great challenge [23,24]. Malachite green dye has been highlighted as one of the causes of high heartbeat, headache, and irritation of the eyes [25,26]. Therefore, its efficient removal from wastewater is of priority.</p>
        <p>In recent time, many research works have been performed for removal of MG dye from aqueous solution by using hydrogel composite. Hosseinzadeh and Sonia Ramin, prepared the starch-graft-poly(acrylamide)/graphene oxide/hydroxyapatite hydrogel nanocomposite for removal of MG dye. The maximum adsorption capacity of the hydrogel composite for MG dye was examined to 297 mg g -1 [14]. Similarly, a magnetic bacterial cellulose nanofiber/graphene oxide polymer aerogel was synthesized by Payam Arabkhani and Arash</p>
        <p>Asfaram for adsorption of MG dye with maximum adsorption tendency of 270.27 mg g -1 [27]. These types of research works demonstrated the capability of hydrogel nanocomposites in detoxifying water laden with organic pollutants. But, in present work, we have synthesized the sodium alginate and graphite hydrogel composite for MG dye removal with high adsorption capacity of 628.93 mg g -1 . The synthesized hydrogel composite shows exceptional high adsorption capacity in comparison to previously reported adsorbents.</p>
        <p>Herein, we performed hot air oven-assisted synthesis of hydrogel composite by free radical polymerization of sodium alginate, acrylic acid and graphite powder. The prepared sodium alginate cross-linked acrylic acid/graphite powder (NaA-cl-AAc-GP) hydrogel composite was used as an absorbent to remove malachite green dye from aqueous solutions. Also, we</p>
        <p>Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f discussed the effect of various reaction conditions such as pH, adsorbent dose, dye concentration and contact time on dye adsorption behaviour of the hydrogel composite.</p>
        <p>Reaction kinetics and adsorption isotherm models were employed to study the adsorption behaviour of the dye on the prepared adsorbent.</p>
        <p>Sodium</p>
        <p>For pzc analysis, 50 mL of distilled water was taken in a 150 mL conical flask. The pH of water was adjusted between 2 to 11 using 0.1N NaOH and 0.1N HCl solutions. Around 0.5 g of sample was added to the pH solution and then kept under shaking (rpm-90) for 24 hours to catch the equilibrium point. After 24 hour, pH of the liquid was measured denoted as pH f .</p>
        <p>The value of pzc for prepared sample was evaluating by plotting a graph between initial pH (pH i ) against difference between initial (pH i ) and final pH (pH f ).</p>
        <p>A proposed mechanism for the chemical cross-linking of sodium alginate with acrylic acid and graphite is presented in scheme 2a. Firstly, the initiator KSO decomposed under heating to produce sulphate ion radicals. These sulphate ions then react with water to form OH radicals, which further react with the NaA polymeric backbone and monomer to generate active free radical sites. Subsequently, AAc grafted onto the NaA backbone and form long polymeric chains. Meanwhile, the cross-linker linked the long polymeric chains to form three dimensional NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite. Scheme 2b show the possible interaction between the polymeric matrix and graphite. Mainly three types of possible interactions are represented in the scheme: covalent bonding, electrostatic interaction and π-π interactions [28].</p>
        <p>The swelling percentage of the hydrogel composite increased with GP concentration (Figure S2), reaching a maximum swelling capacity of 3838.65 % when 0.050 g of GP was incorporated. However, beyond 0.050 g, the excess GP ruptures the three-dimensional structure of the composite, which resulted in a decrease in swelling capacity. Moreover, the excess GP resulted in a decrease in the hydrophilicity of the hydrogel composite, resulting in poor interaction with water.</p>

        <p>The adsorption of MG dye depends on the electrostatic interaction between the functional groups of the dye molecule and surface functionality of the hydrogel composite. The surface charge of hydrogel composite varies with the change in initial pH of water. With the increase in pH i , the functional groups of hydrogel composite undergo deprotonation. In detail, the hydrogel's surface will be positively charged if pH i ˂ pH pzc and it will be negatively charged if pH i ˃ pH pzc . In our analysis, the pH pzc for hydrogel composite is 6.5, which means for pH values below 6.5 (Figure 1), the active sites on hydrogel composite are positively charged and are not favorable for the adsorption of cationic MG dye. At pH values of higher than 6.5, the surface of the hydrogel composite are negatively charged. Conclusively, the hydrogel composite shows negative surface charge at pH 7. and 873 cm -1 are attributed to the β-glycosidic linkage between the mannuronic and guluronic units of NaA [29]. Meanwhile, the broad peaks at 2931 cm -1 and 1406 cm -1 were due to the sp 3 C-H asymmetric stretching mode and the C-C bending vibration, respectively. The broad peaks at 3434 cm -1 and 1030 cm -1 are due to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl and C-O-C groups [12,30]. After polymerization of sodium alginate with acrylic acid, an additional peak appeared at 1722 cm -1 , confirming the grafting of the monomer onto the NaA backbone [31][32][33]. The peaks at 813 cm -1 and 812 cm -1 are characteristic of the Na-O stretching in the NaA and NaA-cl-AAc spectra while the sharp peak at 1632 cm -1 is assigned to symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of the COO -groups. Decrease in intensity and broadness of the peaks 3434 cm -1 and 1406 cm -1 are attributed to the incorporation of GP in the NaA-cl-AAc hydrogel. Disappearance of the peaks at 873 cm -1 and 813 cm -1 may be due to the addition of GP in the hydrogel matrix. After adsorption of MG dye on the NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite, peak at 1711 cm -1 due to carboxylic groups are almost disappeared (Figure S3)</p>
        <p>and broadness/intensity of the peaks at 3434 cm -1 and 2922 cm -1 are goes down. The subsequent changes in the peaks confirm that MG dye adsorbed in the NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite. 3b), two peaks with binding energies at 282.9 and 286.1 eV corresponds to the C-C and C=O groups, respectively [34]. Meanwhile, the O1s high resolution spectrum was deconvoluted into two peaks at 530.2 and 531.1 eV (Figure 3c)</p>
        <p>which could be assigned to O from C=O and C-O, respectively [35]. Figure S4a shows the high resolution XPS of C1s, O1s and Na1s orbitals for pure NaA. The orbital spectrum of Na1s region has two major peaks at 1070 eV and 1069 eV, confirming the presence of sodium in two forms: ionic sodium and sodium oxide [36]. The Auger peak (Na KLL) at 495.7 eV indicated the presence of elemental sodium on the surface of NaA [37]. After the crosslinking of NaA with AAc new peaks were introduced in the C1s orbital at 287 eV due to the C-O-C and C-OH (Figure S4b). In case of GP, the fitted spectra for C1s region shows peaks at 282.2 and 282.5 eV attributed to C-C rings (Figure S4c) [38,39]. After the adsorption of MG dye on hydrogel composite, the intensity of peak at 287 eV is decreased in the C1s spectra (Figure S4d). In O1s spectra, broadness of peaks at 531 eV and 530 eV also confirm the MG dye adsorption on NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite (Figure S4d).</p>

        <p>Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of NaA, NaA-cl-AAc hydrogel, GP and NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite. The XRD pattern of NaA is characteristic of the amorphous nature of the material with two broad peaks at 13.61° and 21.5 o corresponding to the (110) and ( 200) crystal planes of guluronic and mannuronic units, respectively [40]. Subsequent to grafting, there was a decrease in the diffraction peak intensity and enhancement in broadening of the NaA-cl-AAc hydrogel peaks, which suggested successful grafting of AAc onto the NaA backbone. On the other hand, the XRD pattern of GP showed an intense, sharp peak at 26.6° corresponding to the (002) diffraction plane of graphene layers [41] and another smaller peak</p>
        <p>The Raman spectra for GP and NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite are shown in Figure 5.</p>
        <p>In the GP spectrum, two pecks were observed at 1336 cm -1 and 1560 cm -1 , corresponding to the disordered (D-band) and graphitic peaks (G-band) of GP, respectively [43,44]. The disordered peak confirmed the disruption of either the edges or topological defects in the graphite sheets and the amount of disorder in the graphite sheets is directly related to the D band intensity. In addition, the presence of the G band confirms the symmetric sp 2 C-C bonds stretching (1560 cm -1 ) [45]. In the spectrum of NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite, the emergence of the D band (1336 cm -1 ) and G band (1560 cm -1 ) confirmed the successful incorporation of graphite in the hydrogel. Moreover, an additional peak at 2702 cm -1 was indicative of graphite exfoliation due to stirring and sonication of graphite powder. The disappearance of peak at 2702 cm -1 and increased in broadness of peaks at G (1570 cm -1 ) and D (1346 cm -1 ) bands assigned to the adsorption of malachite dye molecules on the NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite (Figure S8).</p>
        <p>Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f FESEM analysis was used to examine the morphology of NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite (Figure 6). Sodium alginate (NaA) had a smooth and flat surface (Figure S9a,b) but after grafting with acrylic acid, the surface became rough (Figure S9c,d). FESEM images of GP show its sheet-like nature, with relatively smooth and uniform surfaces (Figure S9e,f).</p>
        <p>After the incorporation of GP, there was formation of interconnected filamentous structures within the hydrogel matrix (Figure 9a,b). This filamentous network covers the interconnected pores of the NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite from inside to the outside.</p>
        <p>This could be linked to the stacked graphene layers of GP. After dye adsorption, the surface morphology of hydrogel composite becomes utterly different from the unloaded hydrogel composite. The surface of dye-loaded hydrogel composite seems to be smoother which is probably due to the voids filled by the dye molecules (Figure S9g,h). Due to the differences in surface charge, electrostatic interactions arise between the carboxylic group (COO -) of NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite and MG dye. Moreover, hydrogen bonding between MG dye and hydroxyl ions of the sodium alginate sub-units play an important role in ensuring efficient interaction. In addition, the presence of GP in the NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite increases the affinity of the hydrogel composite towards MG dye due to potentially negative surface of GP, which further increases the electrostatic attractions between the cationic (MG) dye and negatively charged adsorbent.</p>
        <p>Hence, coupling of GP with NaA-cl-AAc hydrogel in an adsorbent seem more satisfactory adsorbent than using pure GP and NaA-cl-AAc hydrogel, individually.</p>
        <p>The amount GP incorporated in the hydrogel was varied from 0.01 g to 0.1 g in order to establish the influence of GP concentration on the dye adsorption properties of the composite.</p>
        <p>Notably, the adsorption percentage for MG increased from 76 to 89 % as the amount of GP Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f increased from 0.01 g to 0.1 g, the maximum MG removal percentage was observed when 0.05g of GP added into the hydrogel (Figure 7a). Without GP, the adsorption percentage of NaA-cl-AAc hydrogel was 65.8 % which have shown the significant role of GP in enhancing MG removal. In particular, the adsorption efficiency of the hydrogel was significantly lower than that of the hydrogel composite due to the incorporation of graphite [46,47]. In addition, GP has negative charge potential and coupling it with the hydrogel increases the anionic moieties of the hydrogel composite. Hence, the adsorption becomes more favourable due to the strong surface charge differences. However, beyond 0.05 g GP, there was no remarkable change in the adsorption percentage of MG dye. Therefore, the sample containing 0.05 g of GP was identified as the best material towards MG removal and was used to optimise the other experimental parameters.</p>
        <p>pH is one of the most important parameter in dye adsorption, as it influences the dye speciation, adsorbent ability and surface charge, which overall determine the dye-pollutant interactions. To understand the influence of pH, batch experiments were carried out under controlled conditions while varying the pH from 1 to 8 (Figure 7b). It was noted that the adsorption percentage increased with the pH from pH 1 to 7, where it reached a maximum value of 89.71%. Typically, at low pH (1 to 3), there is high concentration of H + ions which compete with the cationic dye species for the active sites in the hydrogel composite, which effectively decrease the dye adsorption efficiency. Furthermore, at low pH, the adsorbent is largely positively charged which causes strong repulsive forces towards the positively charged dye species. After increasing the pH value from 3 to 6, the concentration of the H + ions and the positive charge on the hydrogel composite get reduced [48]. This results in a significant improvement in the removal of the dye molecules. Particularly, maximum dye adsorption was observed at pH 7 (89.71 %) due to the electrostatic attractions between the Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f predominantly positively charged dye species and negatively charged hydrogel composite.</p>
        <p>Thus, pH 7 was selected as optimum pH for further adsorption experiments. In addition, the adsorbent material contains some chelating groups like sulfonic acid, carboxylic and hydroxyl ions which participate in accepting and donation of protons at different pH values.</p>
        <p>Importantly, the removal efficiency of organic dyes depends upon the charge of the prepared hydrogel composite, as the anionic character increased there was an increase in strong attractive forces between the negatively charged hydrogel composite and positively charged MG dye.</p>
        <p>The adsorbent dose was varied from 0.01 g to 0.06 g in 50 mg L -1 of MG aqueous solution. It could be seen in Figure 7c that MG removal increased from 60 % to 92 % as the adsorbent dose increased from 0.01 g to 0.04 g, where it reached its maximum. This could be linked to the provision of adequate adsorption sites and increased surface area as the amount of adsorbent increased. Also, at lower adsorbent concentrations, there was a lower spatial prohibition in the molecular structure of MG dye, resulting to increased interactions at the initial stages of the adsorption process.</p>
        <p>Figure 7d shows the effect of initial dye concentration (50 mg L -1 to 500 mg L -1 ) on the adsorption capability of NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite. As the MG initial concentration increased from 50 ppm to 500 ppm, MG removal dropped from a maximum removal of 92 % at 50 ppm to 74 % at 500 ppm. The higher MG removal at low dye concentration could be attributed to the availability of adequate adsorption sites on the adsorbent. However, as the dye concentration increases, the adsorption sites become saturated with dye molecules, resulting to decreased uptake of the dye molecules. shown in Figure S10. The adsorption data was analysed using kinetic models such as pseudo first-order, pseudo second-order and intra-particle diffusion models (supporting information).</p>
        <p>The MG adsorption on the hydrogel composite was better described by the pseudo secondorder kinetic model, as evident from the high correlation coefficient values and smaller difference between experimental and calculated adsorption capacity compared to the pseudo first order. Figure S10c is a graphical representation for intra-particle diffusion and the graph is divided into two linear sections which confirm successive adsorption of MG dye onto NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite. The first step shows the rapid adsorption of MG dye on the hydrogel composite due to the large surface area and strong electrostatic attractions.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, the second linear step is for the final equilibrium phase of adsorption.</p>
        <p>Basically, MG dye molecules were trapped into the inner pores of NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite by intra-particle diffusion. The parameters of this kinetic study were calculated from the intercept and slope using intra-particle diffusion equation and the results are given in Table S1. Hence, it is concluded that both surface adsorption as well as intra-particle diffusion were responsible for the adsorption of MG dye onto NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite.</p>
        <p>The adsorption isotherms are important in adsorptive dye removal applications because they explain the interactions between the absorbent and adsorbate species. In order to determine S2).</p>
        <p>Adsorption-desorption tendency is an important parameter for an adsorbent because it directly affects the adsorption efficiency. It also plays important role in both ecological and economic point of view. So, we studied adsorption-desorption rate of the NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite for five times. The recyclability of NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite was examined using 0.1N HCl as desorbing agent and 0.1N NaOH as regenerating agent and then was washed with distilled water for further use. The MG dye concentration of 50 mg L -1 was used for adsorption-desorption study. As shown in Figure S12, the maximum adsorption percentage are 97.58 % in 1 st cycle, 94.67 % in 2 nd cycle, 91.89 % in 3 rd cycle and 79.63 % after 5 th cycle for NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite. These results suggest good reusability of NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite for removal of MG dye from aqueous solution by using normal reconditioning agents.</p>
        <p>The comparison between the adsorption capacities of previously reported composites with the present work is presented in the Table S3. Remarkably, the prepared NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite showed significantly higher MG adsorption capacity compared to nine different adsorbents reported in the literature. This could be linked to the presence of many functional groups like carboxylic groups and hydroxyl groups which are able to interact with the cationic MG dye by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding, thereby enhancing MG removal. Since NaA was used as a backbone and GP as a filler, this makes the NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite environmental friendly, biodegradable and cost-effective.</p>
        <p>Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f</p>
        <p>In this study, we reported the successful preparation of NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite using radical co-polymerization method. The crystalline allotropic form of carbon, graphite, having unique thermal properties could be easily trapped inside the hydrogel matrix.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the prepared NaA-cl-AAc-GP hydrogel composite showed effective adsorption for malachite green dye. Analysis of the adsorption data revealed that the pseudo second-order adsorption kinetic model Langmuir isotherm model best described the adsorption of MG dye onto hydrogel composite. The maximum adsorption tendency from Langmuir model was calculated to be 628.93 mg g -1 . High adsorption capability of the prepared composite is mainly due to distinctive surface morphology, large surface area and strong functional groups which provide desirable sites for the surface assimilation of organic dye. Thus, graphite integrated hydrogel composite may serve as potential adsorbent for the adsorption of organic pollutants from waste water.</p>
