        <p>Conventional technologies are largely powered by fossil fuel exploitation and have ultimately led to extensive environmental concerns. Hydrogen is an excellent carbon-free energy carrier, but its storage and long-distance transportation remain big challenges. Ammonia, however, is a promising indirect hydrogen storage medium that has well-established storage and transportation links to make it an accessible fuel source. Moreover, the notion of 'green ammonia' synthesised from renewable energy sources is an emerging topic that may open significant markets and provide a pathway to decarbonise a variety of applications reliant on fossil fuels. Herein, a comparative study based on the chosen design, working principles, advantages and disadvantages of direct ammonia fuel cells is summarised. This work aims to review the most recent advances in ammonia fuel cells and demonstrates how close this technology type is to integration with future applications. At present, several challenges such as material selection, NO x formation, CO 2 tolerance, limited power densities and long term stability must still be overcome and are also addressed within the contents of this review.Conventional technologies are largely powered by fossil fuel exploitation and have ultimately led to extensive environmental concerns.

        <p>Energy forms a signicant portion of our economic and social sector. It is a powerful resource directly related to development and standards of living. A constant growth in global population has meant that energy demands have continued to grow, evidenced by the 2.3% increase in global total energy consumption during 2018 compared to that during the previous year. The supply of such energy is primarily delivered through fossil fuel exploitation, making up 81% of the mainstream energy supply in 2018. 1 The means of such exploitation has triggered mass environmental concerns with increased emissions of atmospheric pollutants such as CO 2 and NO x . 2 Suitable management of energy demands whilst simultaneously combating climate change is therefore an increasingly important discussion point within today's society.Energy forms a signicant portion of our economic and social sector.

        <p>To tackle the difficulties related to hydrogen and truly value the concept of a hydrogen economy, hydrogen carriers have been suggested. These involve ethanol and methanol as indirect hydrogen storage media to generate electricity. The rst direct methanol fuel cell was described by Justi and Winsel in 1955 and the properties of methanol have since been studied for more than several decades due to its low cost and reactivity. 19,20 Ethanol has also gained attention as a less toxic, readily available alcohol alternative to methanol for use within fuel cells. 21 Nevertheless, these organic-based fuels contain carbon and so will release CO 2 upon utilisation. Their indirect use in hydrogen proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) would therefore require the presence of a steam reformer in order to abstract hydrogen from the carbon source and a carbon capture and storage unit, which would contribute weight, additional space and cost. 11 This has driven progress towards the use of nitrogen-based fuels like ammonia and hydrazine as carbonfree indirect hydrogen storage media. 22,23 Ammonia contains 17.6 wt% hydrogen and, unlike ethanol and methanol, contains no carbon and therefore will not release CO 2 on decomposition. 23,24 For comparison, a range of hydrogen and ammonia fuel characteristics are illustrated in Table 1.To tackle the difficulties related to hydrogen and truly value the concept of a hydrogen economy, hydrogen carriers have been suggested.

        <p>Ammonia can be used as an emission-less energy vector where it may be converted to hydrogen. A recent publication on producing high-purity hydrogen by electrolysis of ammonia at an intermediate temperature of 250 C has been demonstrated. Lim et al. made use of a solid acid-based electrochemical cell (SAEC), where Cs-promoted Ru on carbon nanotubes (Ru/CNT) acted as a thermal decomposition catalyst and Pt on carbon black mixed with CsH 2 PO 4 was used to catalyse hydrogen electrooxidation. 29 Further to this, the electrocatalytic oxidation of ammonia provides a potential solution for on-board hydrogen supply for a fuel-cell vehicle. Huang et al. recently reported a nanostructured catalyst of Cu 2 O wire-in-Ni(OH) 2 plate passivated by a thin CuO surface to stably electrolyse ammonia solution to hydrogen and nitrogen at a current density of 80 mA cm À2 at 25 C. 30 Alternatively, ammonia may be utilised directly in ammonia fuel cells, in an internal combustion engine or a gas turbine. 31 Ezzat and Dincer proposed a route whereby an internal combustion engine to power a vehicle can be fuelled using both ammonia and hydrogen (from the dissociation of ammonia). It was found that the overall energy efficiency of the system was around 61.89%. 32 Direct ammonia fuel cells are an important emerging technology that can be used to extract the chemical energy within ammonia and convert such into electricity at high efficiency.Ammonia can be used as an emission-less energy vector where it may be converted to hydrogen.

        <p>Ammonia fuel cells can be considered either direct or indirect, depending on where the decomposition of ammonia occurs. Indirect ammonia fuel cells involve thermally decomposing ammonia to release hydrogen. The method of ammonia decomposition for on-site generation of hydrogen for fuel cells has been widely proposed and reviewed. 39,40 Direct ammonia fuel cells, however, reap the benets of using ammonia directly within the fuel cell and truly utilise the chemical energy stored within ammonia itself. This eliminates the necessity of onboard hydrogen storage and bypasses the decomposition step. This leads to savings in facility and operating costs, improving the overall efficiency. 5,23,[41][42][43][44] This review will therefore focus on direct ammonia fuel cells. Ammonia fuel cells can be categorised according to different criteria including electrolyte, temperature, and reactant-based and ion transfer-based classi-cations. 45 Within this review, we focus on direct ammonia fuel cells to convert the chemical energy in ammonia into electricity and classify the technology based on electrolyte type as follows: Fig. 1 Landscape of green ammonia illustrating renewable synthesis of ammonia from generation sources and the variety of end uses. 35 Oxygen anion conducting electrolyte-based solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC-O) Proton conducting electrolyte-based solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC-H) Alkaline ammonia fuel cells (AAFCs) (including molten alkaline ammonia fuel cells) Alkaline membrane-based fuel cells (AMFCs) Microbial ammonia fuel cells Previous reviews have focused on a variety of ammonia fuel cells with various electrolyte materials, electrocatalyst materials and operating temperatures. 3,5,41,44,46,47 However, it is important to analyse the conditions that provide the most up-to-date optimum performances.

        <p>The manufacture of ammonia is already well established, with a global production of 180 million tons being reported in 2015. 48,49 This is mainly owing to its vast use as a fertilizer as well as a precursor for chemical synthesis and industrial refrigerants. 23,50 Currently, large-scale production of ammonia is typically carried out via the Haber-Bosch (H-B) process. 51,52 3H 2 (g) + N 2 (g) # 2NH 3 (g), DH ¼ À92 kJ mol À1The manufacture of ammonia is already well established, with a global production of 180 million tons being reported in 2015. 48,49 This is mainly owing to its vast use as a fertilizer as well as a precursor for chemical synthesis and industrial refrigerants. 23,50 Currently, large-scale production of ammonia is typically carried out via the Haber-Bosch (H-B) process. 51,52 3H 2 (g) + N 2 (g) # 2NH 3 (g), DH ¼ À92 kJ mol À1</p>

        <p>From a thermodynamic perspective, this reaction is favourable at room temperature and has a Gibbs free energy value of À32.9 kJ per mol N 2 . 51,53 The reaction, however, endures a large kinetic barrier associated with the strong covalent N^N bond. The presence of a catalyst and excessively high temperatures are therefore required. 51,54 The H-B process typically operates at temperatures ranging from 325-525 C and high pressures ranging from approximately 150-350 atm in a reactor with an iron-based catalyst to produce ammonia at a yield of around 10-20%. 23,44 These conditions have high-energy costs associated with them and potential safety issues. 51 During the H-B process, ammonia is synthesised from its basic elements, hydrogen and nitrogen. Although the latter can easily be obtained from the abundancy of nitrogen within the atmosphere, the origin of hydrogen remains a crucial challenge. [55][56][57][58][59] A conventional H-B plant converts natural gases like methane or liqueed petroleum gases like propane into hydrogen gas through steam reformation; this is then mixed with nitrogen gas from the air to produce ammonia. 51 It is important to realise that even though the use of ammonia itself is carbon free, the production process releases carbon dioxide as a by-product of fossil fuel exploitation. 44 A clean, large-scale synthesis route for ammonia at reduced temperature and pressure is therefore of particular interest. A recent publication by Fernandez et al. has addressed such issues by detailing opportunities for intermediate temperature renewable ammonia synthesis. 60 Furthermore, alternative routes for clean ammonia synthesis have been proposed. 61 As suggested by Siemens, green ammonia is signicant in meeting the challenges of the 21st century. By synthesising ammonia through renewable methods, CO 2 savings of over 360 000 000 tonne per year world-wide could be made. Siemens has demonstrated a network of technologies that combines hydrogen, supplied through water electrolysis, and nitrogen, extracted from air, in the Haber-Bosch process to synthesise ammonia. 62 The roadmap to clean and sustainable ammonia production requires nding novel methods. 63 Electrochemical synthesis for clean ammonia has been extensively reviewed. [63][64][65][66][67][68][69] The nitrogen electrochemical reduction reaction (NRR) to produce ammonia under ambient conditions can offer an alternative to the H-B process and can produce ammonia via renewable energy. 70 The reactants are derived from nitrogen and water, which are naturally abundant. For example, Han et al. reported an electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis system with air as the nitrogen source, which was shown to be self-powered, eco-friendly, low-cost, facilely fabricated and scaleable. 71 Oen, a major drawback of such a process is nding a material that can assist the NRR, as catalysts tend to show low activity and selectivity due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and water reduction reaction. Catalysts must be designed to optimise mass transport, chemisorption and transduction pathways of protons and electrons. 72 For example, Ampelli recently reported a gas diffusion electrode on stainless steel which successfully overcame the gas transportation limitations for high current ammonia electrosynthesis. 73 Furthermore, Du et al. recently presented an FeS 2 catalyst with superior catalytic performance to achieve a high ammonia yield, high stability and selectivity. Oxygen vacant TiO 2 catalysts grown on Ti 3 C 2 T x nanosheets were found to exhibit an ammonia yield faradaic efficiency of 16.07%, placing it as one of the most promising NRR electrocatalysts. 74 A series of perovskite materials have also been recently proposed as low costing ammonia synthesis catalysts. 59,[75][76][77][78] In this article, we will focus on direct ammonia fuel cell technologies.From a thermodynamic perspective, this reaction is favourable at room temperature and has a Gibbs free energy value of À32.9 kJ per mol N 2 . 51,53 The reaction, however, endures a large kinetic barrier associated with the strong covalent N^N bond.

        <p>Ammonia can be dissolved in water to give a solution with a solubility limit of approximately 35 wt% that does not require any specialised storage equipment and can simply be stored in a glass bottle. 23 Ammonia can be compressed into the liquid state at a pressure of 8 bar and temperature of 20 C, which is much easier than that of hydrogen.

        <p>SOFCs are oen regarded as the most efficient method for power generation and are one of the most commonly studied types of ammonia-fed fuel cell technology. 43,82 This type of fuel cell demonstrates high energy conversion efficiency and a high degree of fuel exibility. Within these systems, ammonia is cracked at elevated temperatures traditionally ranging between 500 and 1000 C. An advantage of using such elevated temperatures is that the cracking of ammonia and the electricity generation process can effectively be merged. Ammonia can therefore be directly fed into SOFCs, eliminating any pretreatment requirement. 81,83 High temperature also alleviates the cost and requirement of a separate ammonia cracking unit and increases the ionic conductivity so ohmic loss at the electrolyte can be minimised. 43 The rst direct ammonia SOFC was reported by Vayenas and Farr in 1980, with the aim of harvesting NO as a chemical feedstock as well as simultaneously producing electricity. 84 The fuel cell consisted of a Y 2 O 3 -stabilised ZrO 2 zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and Pt electrodes.

        <p>SOFCs can be sorted into two categories in accordance with the type of electrolyte that is used: oxygen anion conducting electrolyte-based SOFCs (SOFC-O) and proton conducting electrolyte-based SOFCs (SOFC-H). 5 2.3.1. Ammonia-fed SOFC-O. The working principle behind SOFC-Os is based on the transportation of oxygen anions across the electrolyte. Ammonia is oxidised via a two-step process. The initial step is the cracking of ammonia and the hydrogen produced is then electrochemically oxidised. Oxygen or air gas is introduced into the cathode chamber and reduced to oxygen anions at the cathode-electrolyte interface. These oxygen ions travel across the electrolyte where they react with hydrogen at the anode to produce water. The reactions that occur at the anode and cathode are stated below and a graphical representation is provided in Fig. 2. 5 Anode:SOFCs can be sorted into two categories in accordance with the type of electrolyte that is used: oxygen anion conducting electrolyte-based SOFCs (SOFC-O) and proton conducting electrolyte-based SOFCs (SOFC-H). 5 2.3.1.

        <p>Water is present at the anode along with ammonia fuel and so there is a possibility of NO x formation according to eqn (2). Given that a suitable catalyst is employed, the formation of NO is supressed and assumed to be negligible, but the presence of nitrogen gas may reach high concentrations depending on the temperature and pressure used. This in turn can affect the thermodynamic equilibrium of ammonia decomposition, dilute the in situ generated hydrogen and decrease the reversible cell potential of the fuel cell. 3 2.3.2. Choice of electrolyte for ammonia-fed SOFC-O. The electrolytes used for SOFC-O tend to be based on metal oxide solid ceramics. YSZ is the most commonly employed electrolyte and was rst used by Vayenas and Farr for ammonia fuel cells. 84 This is owing to its high ionic conductivity which allows the effective transportation of oxygen anions across the electrolyte and leads to a reduction in the internal resistance. Along with this, such solid electrolytes demonstrate a high chemical and thermal stability, which is vital when dealing with the elevated temperatures. 43 Electrolytes based on ceria such as samarium doped ceria (SDC) have also generated interest due to their high ionic conductivities at reduced temperatures. 85 Along with the inherent properties of the materials used, it is important to note that external properties such as the thickness of the electrolyte can also affect cell performance. The internal resistance of an SOFC will decrease when utilizing a thinner electrolyte. However, reducing the thickness of the electrolyte too greatly, say to less than 10 mm, may reduce its mechanical strength and thus the long term stability. A trade-off must therefore be implemented to ensure that the electrolyte is thin but with reasonable mechanical strength. Since thickness of the electrolyte has a direct effect on the fuel cell performance, this is listed for comparison in Table 2.Water is present at the anode along with ammonia fuel and so there is a possibility of NO x formation according to eqn (2).

According to the thermodynamic equilibrium, ammonia can be decomposed in the absence of Ni-based catalysts; however, the reaction rate is much slower than that with catalysts. 86 Ni has been shown to be a very efficient anodic catalyst, with extremely high ammonia conversion rates at elevated temperatures over 600 C. 87 The effects of Ni-doping on ammonia decomposition were studied by Itagaki et al. using Ni-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC) as an anode for a SOFC-O fuelled with 6% ammonia. 88 In the absence of Ni, the SDC powders showed poor activity towards ammonia decomposition and temperatures greater than 650 C were required for complete conversion.

        <p>The improved power density of ammonia-fed SOFC-Os can in part be attributed to the improved conversion of ammonia to hydrogen at higher temperature. Wang et al. found that when using a Ba-modied Ni-YSZ anode, there was a progressive increase in ammonia decomposition as temperature increased. 87 At an operating temperature of 625 C, the conversion efficiency of ammonia to hydrogen was found to be 87.64%. This increased to 94.52 and 100% as temperature increased to 675 and 700 C, respectively. This is shown in Fig. 3. Similar temperature dependent results were demonstrated by Stoeckl et al., who evaluated ammonia conversion in various ammonia compositions against different temperatures over a Ni-YSZ anode. 102 As temperatures were increased from 700 to 800 C, the conversion of ammonia increased to nearly 100% for all compositions tested. At elevated temperatures, the polarisation resistances for both the anode and cathode site decreased, thus improving the fuel cell performance. 101,103 As ammonia is suggested as an alternative to hydrogen fuelled cells, it is important to compare the two fuels in terms of their power output. A key observation to note is the progressively similar performances between ammonia-fed and hydrogen-fed SOFC-Os as temperature is increased, especially at 106 When increasing the operating temperature from 750 to 800 C, peak power densities increased from 950 to 1078 mW cm À2 and 1025 to 1104 mW cm À2 for ammonia and hydrogen, respectively. When temperatures were elevated further to 850 C, peak power densities increased to 1174 and 1192 mW cm À2 for ammonia and hydrogen, respectively. The progressively similar results between ammonia and hydrogen-fed fuel cells demonstrate the feasibility of ammonia as a suitable substitute for hydrogen as a fuel. This is due to the more extensive decomposition of ammonia at increasing temperatures, thus more closely resembling that of pure hydrogen-fed fuel cells.

        <p>These ammonia fuel cells based on proton-conducting electrolytes are encouraging candidates for SOFC technology since they maintain good ionic conductivity at lower temperatures compared to SOFC-Os. As efficient proton conductivity can therefore be achieved at lower temperatures, the choice of materials that can be used is expanded since catalyst sintering and thermal expansion mismatch of SOFC components are minimised. 109,110 Water/steam is formed at the cathode side, and will not dilute the ammonia fuel at the anode. Lower operating temperatures in systems employing oxygen ionconducting ceramic electrolytes would result in lower ionic conductivity, which subsequently would result in high ohmic losses. 109 2.3.6. NO x formation. Whilst much attention was initially devoted towards SOFC-Os, these systems conventionally led to the production of NO x without the use of a suitable catalyst, as discussed in Section 2.3.1. As a promising alternative, SOFC-Hs were studied to mitigate the formation of NO x . 109 Since steam is produced at the cathode rather than being introduced at the anode site, the possibility of NO x formation is eliminated, as is the need for gas separation and recirculation at the anode. 109 This is a key advantage of SOFC-H over SOFC-O systems since the former mitigates the risk of NO x release that could be detrimental to human and environmental health. Since there is no management of water or dilution of the fuel at the anodic end, greater fuel utilisation can be attained. 110 From a thermodynamic perspective, the peak power density of ammonia-fed SOFC-H is on average 20-30% higher than its SOFC-O counterpart under a majority of testing conditions. This is signicantly owing to the higher hydrogen concentration at the anode of SOFC-H in all scenarios. 111 2.3.7. Choice of electrolyte for ammonia-fed SOFC-H.

Therefore, introducing dopants that are stable in order to create mixed metal oxides has been favoured. 115,116 Amongst electrolyte compositions, Gd, Zr and Nd-doped Ba cerates have been employed for these properties. 113,[115][116][117] These mixed oxide ceramics have shown high proton conductivity at temperatures lower than that of oxygen ion-conducting electrolytes. 118 2.3.8.

        <p>The ammonia decomposition reaction is oen impeded by hydrogen adsorption on the catalytic reaction sites. Therefore, a high tolerance to hydrogen poisoning is a crucial factor for catalysts with high activity towards ammonia decomposition. Ni-BaCe 0.4 Zr 0.4 Y 0.2 O 3Àd (Ni-BCZY), for example, has a higher tolerance to hydrogen poisoning than Ni-YSZ and Ni-GDC and thus displays greater catalytic activity towards ammonia decomposition. Miyazaki et al. investigated the effect of ammonia decomposition over a range of anodic materials in ammonia fuelled SOFC-Hs. 119 It was found that the performance was signicantly dependent on ammonia decomposition at the anode and that anodic temperature, due to the endothermic nature of ammonia decomposition, had a direct effect on the extent of conversion. For Ni-YSZ and Ni-GDC anodes, temperatures of 750 C were required for complete decomposition of ammonia. In contrast, Ni-BCZY completely decomposed ammonia at 600 C.The ammonia decomposition reaction is oen impeded by hydrogen adsorption on the catalytic reaction sites. Therefore, a high tolerance to hydrogen poisoning is a crucial factor for catalysts with high activity towards ammonia decomposition. Ni-BaCe 0.4 Zr 0.4 Y 0.2 O 3Àd (Ni-BCZY), for example, has a higher tolerance to hydrogen poisoning than Ni-YSZ and Ni-GDC and thus displays greater catalytic activity towards ammonia decomposition. Miyazaki et al. investigated the effect of ammonia decomposition over a range of anodic materials in ammonia fuelled SOFC-Hs. 119 It was found that the performance was signicantly dependent on ammonia decomposition at the anode and that anodic temperature, due to the endothermic nature of ammonia decomposition, had a direct effect on the extent of conversion. For Ni-YSZ and Ni-GDC anodes, temperatures of 750 C were required for complete decomposition of ammonia. In contrast, Ni-BCZY completely decomposed ammonia at 600 C.</p>
        <p>2.3.9. Effect of operating temperature on ammonia-fed SOFC-H. Temperature plays a signicant role on SOFC-H performance. Protonic conductivity across the electrolyte increases proportionally as temperature is increased, as iden-tied by the Arrhenius equation. By increasing the conductivity of protons across the electrolyte, cell resistance is reduced by minimising ohmic losses at the electrolyte and the polarisation loss on electrodes. Furthermore, elevated temperatures lead to a more complete ammonia decomposition, which in turn leads to a higher accessibility of protons. 118,120 Ammonia conversion efficiency against the effect of temperature was recently evaluated by Miyazaki et al., who used a Ni-BCZY catalyst as the anodic component. 119 It was found that the conversion of ammonia increased from less than 10% at 400 C to 40 and 100% at 500 and 600 C, respectively. This demonstrates a signicant increase in ammonia decomposition with rising temperature, especially as temperatures tend towards and rise above 600 C.2.3.9.

        <p>Similar to SOFC-Os, the performances of ammonia-fed and hydrogen-fed SOFC-Hs have also been compared. 104,110,120 Miyazaki et al. reported a SOFC-H set up employing ammonia and hydrogen gas as the anodic fuel. 119 The set up involved a Ni- BCZY anode, BCZY electrolyte and LSCF cathode, operating at a temperature range from 550-700 C. At a lower temperature of 550 C, peak power densities of 130 and 140 mW cm À2 were obtained for ammonia and hydrogen as a fuel, respectively. As temperatures were further elevated to 700 C, peak power densities of 320 and around 380 mW cm À2 were obtained for ammonia and hydrogen as a fuel, respectively. Here, the differences in power densities between the ammonia-fed and hydrogen-fed fuels at 700 C seem larger than those at lower temperatures; this can be related to the difference in local partial pressure of hydrogen at the anodic side. The performances of such are demonstrated in Fig. 6.Similar to SOFC-Os, the performances of ammonia-fed and hydrogen-fed SOFC-Hs have also been compared. 104,110,120 Miyazaki et al. reported a SOFC-H set up employing ammonia and hydrogen gas as the anodic fuel. 119 The set up involved a Ni- BCZY anode, BCZY electrolyte and LSCF cathode, operating at a temperature range from 550-700 C.

As the temperature was increased to 500, 550 and 600 C, the peak power density was enhanced from 210, 340 and 580 mW cm À2 , respectively. The excellent performance of the hydrogen fuel cell could be related to the high catalytic activity of Pd in its ability to dissociate H 2 molecules.

        <p>Good chemical stability of a hydroxide-conducting electrolyte is crucial to achieve practical longevity of AMFCs. More than oen, pure O 2 or CO 2 free air is used as the oxidant at the cathode to avoid the formation of CO 3 2À ions. 129,140 From this point of view, it is desired to develop CO 2 -tolerant OH À ion conductors to be used as electrolytes for AMFCs. The choice of electrolytes for ammonia-fed AMFCs is based on good chemical stability, high ionic conductivity and robust mechanical properties. 141 Since these systems are also concerned with the transportation of OH À ions produced at the cathode and consumed at the anode, the electrolyte must also demonstrate resistance to water swelling. Water uptake is therefore another important parameter in regard to membrane employment. [141][142][143][144] Reviews on AMFC properties have been widely documented. 140,[145][146][147] AMFCs typically operate at a temperature that is determined by the durability of the alkaline membrane. 145 Commercially available AEMs such as Tokuyama A201 are offered for use within fuel cells and require specic operating conditions including maximum current density and temperature limits that they can withstand. Beyond these limits, the membranes lose their functionality and are deemed unstable for use. 148 Recently, the power density and longevity of membranes to be used within AMFCs have been improved due to the development of AEMs with high conductivity and better chemical and mechanical stability. 149 Great efforts have been devoted towards synthesising AEMs with alkaline stability at 80 C or higher. 142,143,145,150 These membranes are typically designed based on two distinctive features: a polymer backbone and an ion conductive moiety. 151 Wang et al. reported the synthesis of a poly(aryl piperidinium) (PAP) membrane and showed a steady increase in OH À conductivity across the membrane as temperature was increased. 150 The conductivity more than doubled, from 78 to 193 mS cm À1 , as the temperature was elevated from 20 to 95 C. Increased OH À conductivity across the membrane can in turn lead to faster reaction kinetics at the anodic side since OH À ions are delivered at a faster rate. Likewise, Lee et al. demonstrated a similar trend when using a PAP membrane. 142 It was found that OH À conductivity increased from 54 to 112 mS cm À1 as temperature was elevated from 25 to 80 C. It should also be noted that at this elevated temperature, a greater water uptake was also observed.

        <p>Similar to SOFCs, the electrolyte thickness of AMFCs is a crucial factor of fuel cell performance. Membrane related ohmic losses within the AMFC can be reduced by the use of a thinner membrane. This decreases diffusion and mass transfer distances that the OH À must cross, so the reactant can be delivered to the anode at a faster rate. Whilst pursuing thinner membranes, good mechanical properties and mechanical robustness must not be compromised. 140 Reducing the membrane thickness too greatly could lead to fuel permeation across the membrane, resulting in fuel crossover and potential ooding of the cathode side. 41 This has been observed in cases which have led to a reduced OCV and overall fuel cell performance. 152 2.4.2. Choice of anode and cathode electrocatalysts for ammonia-fed AMFCs. The catalyst chosen for the anodic component is of particular interest since the oxidation of ammonia is known to be sluggish. 153 Therefore, the need for a suitable catalyst is important. A basic understanding of the ammonia electrooxidation reaction (AOR) mechanism stated in eqn ( 9) is crucial for designing such a catalyst. A density functional theory (DFT) study was conducted by Herron et al. using computational activation energies to analyse AOR activity on different catalytic materials. 153 Based on the volcano plot constructed within the study, it was found that precious metals such as Pt, Pd and Ir are limited by their strong binding energy to N. For metals that bind even more strongly to N than Pt, N-N association becomes even more difficult, resulting in inactivity despite a lower onset potential in some cases. In contrast to this, coinage metals such as Cu, Ag and Au bind more weakly to N than Pt but were also found to be inactive for N 2 generation. Even though Cu shows theoretically high activity towards the AOR, it binds to N atoms too weakly which reduces its practical activity. An unrealistically high overpotential of 1.22 V would be required to lower the barrier of this electrochemical step. Therefore, it was concluded that in searching for an optimum catalyst, one should explore surfaces with binding properties in between those of Pt, which binds too strongly, and Cu, which binds too weakly. It should be noted that besides the choice of material, the structure and temperature dependence of the catalyst have an important effect on ammonia oxidation rates and selectivity. 154 Materials that show promising activity towards the AOR can be categorized into three groups: (i) Pt-based materials, (ii) Nibased materials and (iii) other Pt-free catalysts. Pt and Ptbased materials are the most widely employed and wellestablished catalysts towards the AOR, and for this reason they are extensively documented. 41,[155][156][157][158] However, due to expense, scarcity and instability, the use of Pt is limited and the need to develop Pt-free catalysts is essential for a cost effective route towards the AOR.

        <p>Ni-based AOR catalysts are oen challenged by corrosion of the catalyst which can lower the overall efficiency. Moreover, the potential at which the AOR occurs on the Ni/Ni(OH) 2 electrode tends to overlap with the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox potential. To overcome these barriers, several pathways have been suggested such as the use of Ni alloys and manipulation of surface sensitive synthesis to optimise the Ni nanoparticle structure. 41,162,163 By introducing a metal that has a high activity towards the AOR but a low affinity for N, with a metal that has a low activity but a high affinity for N, a synergistic effect is present. 155,157,158,164 Many experimental ndings have demonstrated both improved AOR activity and material stability of Ni-based catalysts on introduction of another metallic species to form an alloy. Such active materials for the AOR can be used as anodic components for AMFCs. For example, Ni 2 P supported on nickel foam has been reported as an excellent catalyst for electrochemical oxidation of ammonia. 165 Non-precious metals have been alloyed with Ni to produce bimetallic species with increased activity towards the AOR, with lowered onset potentials and enhanced current densities. 163,[166][167][168] Cu is an exceptional doping element due to the synergetic effect between Ni and Cu which display different Nbonding strengths. It has been found to enhance the AOR current density and endure resistance towards electrodissolution due to enhancement of surface active sites. 163,166 Xu and Tao et al. reported the use of hierarchical NiCu layered hydroxide (LH) nanowires which were directly grown on carbon cloth using hydrothermal synthesis. 163 An optimized elemental ratio of Ni 0.8 Cu 0.2 was chosen and the activity against pure Ni(OH) 2 electrodes was investigated. The Ni 0.8 Cu 0.2 LH demonstrated a substantial increase in current density reaching 35 mA cm À2 at 0.55 V in 0.5 M NaOH and 55 mM NH 4 Cl. This activity was greater than those of pure Ni(OH) 2 and commercial Pt/C which were found to be 5 and 9 mA cm À2 , respectively. Despite the ambiguity over the precise mechanism, it was suggested that the introduction of Cu may have assisted the generation of an additional metal hydroxide, CuOOH, double hydroxides, Ni 1Àx Cu x (OH) 2 , and oxyhydroxides, Ni x Cu 1Àx OOH. The performance is illustrated in Fig. 9.Ni-based AOR catalysts are oen challenged by corrosion of the catalyst which can lower the overall efficiency.

For example, Ni 2 P supported on nickel foam has been reported as an excellent catalyst for electrochemical oxidation of ammonia. 165 Non-precious metals have been alloyed with Ni to produce bimetallic species with increased activity towards the AOR, with lowered onset potentials and enhanced current densities. 163,[166][167][168] Cu is an exceptional doping element due to the synergetic effect between Ni and Cu which display different Nbonding strengths. It has been found to enhance the AOR current density and endure resistance towards electrodissolution due to enhancement of surface active sites. 163,166 Xu and Tao et al. reported the use of hierarchical NiCu layered hydroxide (LH) nanowires which were directly grown on carbon cloth using hydrothermal synthesis. 163 An optimized elemental ratio of Ni 0.8 Cu 0.2 was chosen and the activity against pure Ni(OH) 2 electrodes was investigated. The Ni 0.8 Cu 0.2 LH demonstrated a substantial increase in current density reaching 35 mA cm À2 at 0.55 V in 0.5 M NaOH and 55 mM NH 4 Cl. This activity was greater than those of pure Ni(OH) 2 and commercial Pt/C which were found to be 5 and 9 mA cm À2 , respectively. Despite the ambiguity over the precise mechanism, it was suggested that the introduction of Cu may have assisted the generation of an additional metal hydroxide, CuOOH, double hydroxides, Ni 1Àx Cu x (OH) 2 , and oxyhydroxides, Ni x Cu 1Àx OOH. The performance is illustrated in Fig. 9.</p>
        <p>Jiang et al. carried out a series of CV tests to compare the effect of Cu doping in Ni-based electrocatalysts. 169 It was revealed that ammonia oxidation catalyzed by NiOOH alone endured a high onset potential of 1.52 V vs. RHE, whilst the introduction of Cu lowered the onset potential to 1.40 V. Zhang et al. investigated the extent of Cu doping on fuel cell performance with a system that utilised 0.5 M NH 3 and 1 M KOH as the fuel and a Pt cathode at an operating temperature of 25 C. 170 It was found that when increasing the Cu percentage from 0, 30 and 50%, the NiCu catalyst showed an increasing peak power density of 1.84, 2.91 and 5.06 mW cm À2 , respectively. On further increasing to 70 and 100%, the peak power density began to fall to 4.67 and 1.18%, respectively, emphasising the profound effect of the elemental ratio and composition on the performance of the cell. The NiCu/C catalyst has therefore been demonstrated as a good anode for conventional ammonia fuel cells. [171][172][173] Besides metal alloys and their derivatives of metal hydroxides and oxyhydroxides, perovskite oxides such as Sr x La 1Àx Mn y Co 1Ày O 3Àd also exhibit good catalytic activity towards electrochemical oxidation of ammonia. For example, Sr 0.3 La 0.7 Mn 0.4 Co 0.6 O 3Àd on a Ti plate exhibits the highest activity. 174 Similarly, another perovskite oxide, SrFe 0.3 Ni 0.7 O 2.85 , also exhibited good activity. 175 The high activity can be related to the multi-valent transition elements at the B-sites.Jiang et al. carried out a series of CV tests to compare the effect of Cu doping in Ni-based electrocatalysts. 169 It was revealed that ammonia oxidation catalyzed by NiOOH alone endured a high onset potential of 1.52 V vs. RHE, whilst the introduction of Cu lowered the onset potential to 1.40 V.

        <p>For the electrocatalyst choice for cathodes in ammonia-fed AMFCs, catalysts displaying good activity towards the ORR under alkaline conditions, according to reaction (10), can be used. There are many studies reporting ORR catalysts under alkaline conditons, including metals, alloys, oxides, etc. 176,177 In 2019, Tao's group reported the novel use of the perovskite oxide SrCo 0.8 Cu 0.1 Nb 0.1 O 3Àd as a cathode for AMFCs in a two electrode cell, demonstrating perovskite oxides as promising cathodes for AMFCs in real applications. 171 Research on perovskite oxides as a cathode for ammonia-fed AMFCs was further extended to a similar oxide, SrFe 0.8 Cu 0.1 Nb 0.1 O 3Àd . 178 In a recent study, we found a-MnO 2 to be an excellent non-noble cathode for direct ammonia AMFCs. 173 In comparison to the anode, the search for cathode materials for use within AMFCs is not as strenuous as many ORR catalysts under alkaline conditions have already been established in the public domain.

Ammonia AMFC systems have not been as widely explored as other types of fuel cell technologies in regard to temperature dependence. There subsequently have been fewer studies on temperature correlation to AMFC performances. As mentioned above, a major limitation of AMFC performance can be related to the conductivity and stability of AEMs. This has limited much research on AMFCs at elevated temperatures. More recently, polymer-based membranes have been synthesised and have demonstrated superior anionic conductivity at relatively high temperatures, opening the potential for AMFCs to be explored at different temperatures.2.4.3.

        <p>Zhao et al. reported a fuel cell based on a synthesised alkaline PAP membrane, a PtIr anode and an Acta 4020 cathode. 189 When using 3 M NH 3 and 3 M KOH as the anodic fuel and O 2 as the oxidant at the cathode, a maximum power density of 135 mW cm À2 was reported at an operating temperature of 80 C. It is important to note that KOH is oen required at the anodic side and that pure O 2 is oen used at the cathode due to the sensitivity of the polymeric alkaline membrane electrolyte to CO 2 . This makes the use of 'free' air as the oxidant at the cathode difficult. These factors highlight the challenges for high performance ammonia-fed AMFCs.Zhao et al. reported a fuel cell based on a synthesised alkaline PAP membrane, a PtIr anode and an Acta 4020 cathode. 189 When using 3 M NH 3 and 3 M KOH as the anodic fuel and O 2 as the oxidant at the cathode, a maximum power density of 135 mW cm À2 was reported at an operating temperature of 80 C.

        <p>Achrai et al. recently published the results of using an ammonia-fed AMFC with a KOH-free anode feed at operating temperatures of up to 120 C. 190 Two different fuel cell set ups were explored using temperature ranges from 60-95 C and 100-120 C, respectively. The results of these cells are shown in Fig. 10. The former employed a PtIr anode, PAP-TP membrane and Fe-N-C cathode and achieved a maximum power density of around 80 mW cm À2 at 95 C when gaseous ammonia was used as the anodic feed. When Pt 1 Ir 10 was employed as the anode, a Tokuyama membrane and Ag cathode were used in a cell fuelled with 16 M ammonia solution. At a temperature of 120 C, an impressive peak power density of 180 mW cm À2 was obtained, a record high for this fuel cell type. This study not only illustrates the potential of AMFCs to be studied at temperatures higher than room temperature, as is usually recorded, but also demonstrates the ability to reach high peak power densities in the absence of NaOH/KOH. In doing so, the addition of alkali is avoided, saving costs on materials and workup time. It should be noted that whilst the maximum power density is less than that reached by a similar fuel cell with added KOH, the gap is decreased when using a high concentration (16 M) of ammonia and back pressures on both sides of the fuel cell. However, there are still at least two key obstacles facing this type of ammonia AMFC. The cost of a Pt 1 Ir 10 anode is considerably high and O 2 or CO 2 free air must be used as the cathode fuel since the membranes are not compatible with CO 2 . In 2019, the global production for iridium was around 6860 kg, insufficient for large scale commercial fuel cell applications. 191 It is therefore desired to use readily available, non-precious metal catalysts in direct ammonia AMFCs.Achrai et al. recently published the results of using an ammonia-fed AMFC with a KOH-free anode feed at operating temperatures of up to 120 C. 190 Two different fuel cell set ups were explored using temperature ranges from 60-95 C and 100-120 C, respectively.

        <p>Yang et al. conducted an experiment using a heterotrophic nitrifying/denitrifying air-cathode microbial fuel cell (HND-ACMFC) to investigate ammonia-contaminated wastewater over long periods of operation. Wastewater was fed into a reactor by spraying through the cathode for a short period of time. The organics within the wastewater were oxidized in the anode to generate electrons and protons at the bottom of the reactor setup, as shown in Fig. 11. The electrons were transferred through the external load to the cathode, while the protons diffused to the cathode. In the air-exposed biocathode (AEB), bio-electrochemical reduction reactions were fullled accompanied by some biological reactions (e.g. nitrication-denitrication). The HND-ACMFC consequently achieved stable energy recovery and ammonia removal in an economical way. 205 Yang et al. utilised an air-cathode MFC to simultaneously remove ammonia from wastewater whilst generating power. 205 It was reported that a high ammonia removal efficiency of 99% was achieved whilst a maximum power density of 100 mW m À3 was obtained. The use of an air-breathing cathode makes the whole system very simple and easy to scale up, as shown in over the duration of one month whilst employing a system that magnetically cleaned the cathodic component. 198 The observed system had a power output 42% higher than when no magnetcleaning controls were used (116 AE 4 mW m À2 ). The ndings highlight the challenges associated with MFCs, that is the reduced performance over time in the absence of efficient cleaning techniques. A limitation in using such technology is the presence of biofouling due to biolm formation on the cathode and catalyst deterioration. This renders the applicability of MFC technology. Further to this, ammonia emissions of air-cathode MFCs pose a serious environmental and health threat but the control and mitigation of such emissions have not been studied yet. Consequently, Li et al. have recently reported the characterisation and control of ammonia emissions in MFCs. 206 MFC technology has also been proposed as a suitable method for air purication by removing ammonia from air. Yan and Liu reported Sn-doped V 2 O 5 nanoparticles as an effective catalyst for the fast removal of ammonia in air via photo-electrocatalysis (PEC) MFCs. An optimal degradation of 96.4% ammonia was achieved and it was shown that the Sn-doping decreased the size of nanoparticles, increased the oxidising capacity and increased the number of active sites. The oxygen vacancies played a particular key role in ammonia oxidation. 207Yang et al. conducted an experiment using a heterotrophic nitrifying/denitrifying air-cathode microbial fuel cell (HND-ACMFC) to investigate ammonia-contaminated wastewater over long periods of operation.

        <p>It has been reported that traditional SOFCs in pressurised atmospheres have been shown to be extremely effective when integrated with gas turbines (GT), achieving efficiencies of up to 70%, the highest efficiency hybrid power generation system known to date. 208 Understanding the performance and stability of ammonia-fed SOFCs operating at elevated pressure is important to realise the potential of these systems to replace conventional SOFCs in hybrid SOFC-GTs. 209 The performance of an ammonia fuelled SOFC was tested against a hydrogen fuelled SOFC under various atmospheric pressures and temperatures. 106 It was found that for both fuel cell systems, power densities increased with pressurisation. When atmospheres were increased from 1 to 3 atm, peak power densities increased from 1078 to 1148 mW cm À2 for the ammonia fuelled cell operating at 800 C. Under the same conditions, the hydrogen fuelled cell demonstrated an increase of 1104 to 1193 mW cm À2 . The results illustrate the potential of ammonia fuelled SOFCs in the development of hybrid pressurised SOFC-gas turbine (SOFC-GT) power generation systems. 106,210 Further to this, Ishak et al. explored the integration of ammonia-fed SOFC-GTs in combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) cycles. 211 The refrigeration properties of ammonia were exploited to provide adequate cooling to the trigeneration system with little complexity and cost. At pressures of nearly 5 atm and an operating temperature of 800 C, the energy efficiency of the SOFC-H integrated cycle reached 81.1% (76.7% when its SOFC-O counterpart is used). Both SOFC-O and SOFC-H demonstrated excellent energy efficiencies of SOFC-GTs at elevated pressure. Hybrids of SOFCs using cogeneration or tri-generation allow recovery of exhaust heat from the cells, improving efficiencies of such integrated systems. 212 Additional ammonia SOFC hybrid systems have been explored for power generation in a number of technologies including solar towers and transportation.

        <p>The use of renewable fuels, such as biofuels, to complement batteries in a hybrid system would assist in overcoming the range and recharge limitations of batteries. However, the scale of biofuels is restricted by their environmental footprint once land and water usage are taken into consideration. 221 Carbon-neutral fuels, such as ammonia, may therefore be a sustainable complement to batteries. 189,222,223 Siddiqui and Dincer developed a novel hybrid ammonia fuel cell and battery system through experimental and modelling techniques. 222 The system demonstrated enhanced use of electrochemical energy and allowed for the individual components to be utilised sequentially, for example, employment of the AMFC component in periods of battery recharge. Compared to an energy efficiency of 15.2 AE 1.3% for the ammonia-fed AMFC, the ammonia-fed AMFC and battery hybrid system was found to operate at 27.5%.

        <p>Ammonia fuelled SOFCs for transportation have more recently been investigated. 224 Al-Hamed and Dincer proposed an ammonia-fed SOFC integrated with a gas turbine and ammoniaorganic Rankine cycle to recover and utilise waste heat as a trigeneration system for cleaner railway applications. 225 The hybrid system was studied using a thermodynamic model to evaluate its energy and power outputs. It was found that the energy efficiency of the integrated system was 58.7%, with no CO 2 emissions and sufficient energy demand to satisfy a passenger locomotive. Within this integrated system, 94.5% of the total power output was generated by the SOFC-GT and this predominantly governed the performance of the system. Later, a study using a similar integrated system showed an energy efficiency of 68.5% for a passenger locomotive; this was optimised to 79.88% with an energy efficiency of nearly 79.88% based on the ammonia-fed SOFC component alone. 226 Along with public transport, power generation from ammonia fuelled SOFCs has been proposed to power fuel cell vehicles (FCV). Perna et al. studied a combined heat, hydrogen and power (CHHP) system, where an ammonia fuelled SOFC was used to produce 100 kg per day of hydrogen to refuel between 20 and 30 FCVs. 215 The experiment aimed to meet the demands of hydrogen small scale relling stations, as well as to produce electricity for electric vehicles and heat for local use. Tests were conducted using a single ammonia fuelled SOFC and different simulation mixtures. The CHHP system showed high efficiencies ranging from 71-81%. Such systems have potential in real life applications as they allow for renewable refuelling stations in regions that are scarce in renewable energy sources such as Korea and Japan. In these regions, it is increasingly attractive to therefore use ammonia as a hydrogen carrier rather than import pure hydrogen. It should be noted that the oxide materials for making SOFCs are fragile, making them challenging to directly power electric vehicles. SOFCs based on metal current collectors are more robust. Further research is required to determine whether these materials are strong enough to be used in transportation applications.Ammonia fuelled SOFCs for transportation have more recently been investigated. 224 Al-Hamed and Dincer proposed an ammonia-fed SOFC integrated with a gas turbine and ammoniaorganic Rankine cycle to recover and utilise waste heat as a trigeneration system for cleaner railway applications. 225 The hybrid system was studied using a thermodynamic model to evaluate its energy and power outputs.

        <p>Traditional treatment of wastewater can be cost and energy demanding. Microbial fuel cells have been studied as methods to convert sewage directly into electricity, utilizing waste as an energy source. 198,227 SOFC technology may be considered within wastewater recovery systems. Wastewater contains unused energy in the form of dissolved ammonia. This ammonia source, once extracted from wastewater through pre-treatment, can be used as a promising fuel for SOFCs 172,[228][229][230] An example of utilising the ammonia within wastewater is via decomposition of struvite. Struvite precipitation is a method used to remove nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen in wastewater. It can be decomposed to ammonia-water mixtures which can then be used to fuel SOFC systems. 231 Grasham et al. demonstrated extraction of ammonia from waste to then be utilised within a SOFC. 232 It was found that 82% of ammonia was recovered from diverted digestible liquor for use as fuel in a SOFC system to be implemented within wastewater treatment plants. The SOFC ran at an electrical efficiency of 48%, with the extracted ammonia contributing 4.6% of its power output. Using such a method could also reduce carbon dioxide emissions since conventional biological treatment of wastewater oen results in greenhouse gas emissions. The use of ammonia from wastewater as a fuel for SOFCs can lead to an estimated reduction of 3.5 kg CO 2 per year per person at the treatment facility due to the avoidance of biological processing in conventional wastewater treatment. Further implementation of this type of technology could transform a treatment facility from a net consumer to a net producer of electricity.Traditional treatment of wastewater can be cost and energy demanding.

        <p>To fully appreciate the notion of ammonia-fed SOFCs as the next generation of fuel cells, it is imperative to assess the environmental impact of ammonia throughout its lifetime as a fuel. Bicer and Khalid conducted a study to assess the environmental impact in regard to climate change, fossil depletion and human toxicity from power production through SOFCs fuelled by various chemical feedstocks including natural gas, hydrogen, ammonia and methanol. 236 It was found that if ammonia was sourced renewably, from wind electrolysis as was the case of this simulation, ammonia-fed SOFCs become the second best choice in the climate change criterion. Such SOFC systems would signicantly reduce environmental impacts, yielding 0.16 kg CO 2 per kW h electricity. From a comparative perspective, when natural gas was used to fuel a SOFC, 0.41 kg CO 2 per kW h electricity was produced. This shows the excellent potential of ammonia as an environmentally friendly vector and its potential progression towards a more sustainable future.To fully appreciate the notion of ammonia-fed SOFCs as the next generation of fuel cells, it is imperative to assess the environmental impact of ammonia throughout its lifetime as a fuel.

        <p>At present, the most advanced design of SOFCs is the tubular conguration. A recent numerical study by Ilbas et al. indicated that ammonia-fed tubular SOFCs are comparable to that of hydrogen. This can be attributed to their higher volumetric power density, mechanical stability, high thermal shock resistance and absence of sealing issues. 237 However, as detailed in previous chapters, SOFCs greatly rely on high operating temperatures to fully appreciate fuel utilisation. 238 Along with this, it is well established that the rate of ammonia conversion is somewhat slow and requires the use of a suitable catalyst. This is particularly important in SOFC-Os, where another factor that must be considered is NO x formation due to the presence of water at the anode.At present, the most advanced design of SOFCs is the tubular conguration.

        <p>Performance durability and fabrication of materials which can endure such high temperatures for an extensive period of time are challenging. 41 The choice of catalyst is therefore extremely important in order to avoid chemical compatibility issues in long-term operation. There have, however, been advances in catalyst selection that allow for lower temperatures to be used and sufficient power performance to still be attained, as summarised in Tables 2 and3. On lowering temperatures, we believe that CsH 2 PO 4 may be a potential electrolyte for intermediate temperature direct ammonia fuel cells since it has shown to be chemically compatible with ammonia at 250 C. 29 As CsH 2 PO 4 is soluble in water, operation of the fuel cells or electrolysers based on the CsH 2 PO 4 electrolyte at a temperature below 100 C in the presence of liquid water could be difficult.Performance durability and fabrication of materials which can endure such high temperatures for an extensive period of time are challenging. 41 The choice of catalyst is therefore extremely important in order to avoid chemical compatibility issues in long-term operation.

        <p>Further to this, the nature of the fuel should also be considered. Ammonia is very corrosive, particularly in the presence of contaminants such as water vapour and air. 239 Anhydrous ammonia is therefore oen adequate. For most SOFCs, the interconnector, an integral component of SOFC conguration, consists of a metal alloy. The chemical compatibility between ammonia and the interconnector material poses another challenge that must be addressed. Corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steel are therefore required for efficient fuel cell design and performance. 239,240 In the case of SOFC-Os, steam is generated at the anode and can mix with unreacted ammonia; this may lead to corrosion of metal pipes. To overcome the issue of toxicity, it may be useful to use a diluted ammonia solution since this is considered non-toxic, non-ammable and can easily be handled. Cinti et al. conducted a study using diluted ammonia-fed into a SOFC system and found the efficiency of the system to be as high as 50%. 241 In the case of SOFC-Hs, this corrosion issue is avoided altogether as steam is generated at the cathode and released together with oxygen-decient air.

        <p>Oen, a trade-off between membrane thickness and mechanical strength must be considered. A reoccurring challenge of low temperature ammonia fuel cells is the crossover of ammonia, oen associated with thinner membranes. This ultimately leads to a reduction in OCV, and in turn, cell efficiency and power. Suzuki et al. obtained an OCV of 0.370 V whilst using Pt-based electrocatalysts at 20 C, much lower than the expected theoretical value of 1.17 V. 152 It was observed that this low OCV was induced by the permeation of ammonia fuel across the alkaline membrane to the cathodic side. N 2 and NO were detected at the cathode by mass spectroscopy, con-rming the oxidation of ammonia occurring at the cathodic side as well as the anodic side. The production of such side products is undesirable, not only since they reduce cell performance, but also since species such as NO can be detrimental to environmental and human health. This crossover phenomenon is widely reported. Lee et al. also displayed a similarly low OCV value of 0.360 V when using Pt-based electrocatalysts in an ammonia fuelled AMFCs. 243 Ishiyama et al. also demonstrated a low OCV of 0.45 V at 50 C, again much lower than theoretical expected value. 193 In PEMFCs, integration of oxide materials within the polymeric membrane can supress the cross-over of liquid fuels. 244 Similar strategies may be employed in alkaline membranes to suppress the cross-over of ammonia in direct ammonia AMFCs.Oen, a trade-off between membrane thickness and mechanical strength must be considered.

        <p>Power densities are also oen limited due to the low catalytic activity of the electrodes at low operating temperatures. 41 This is a primary reason for the deteriorating performance of ammoniafed AMFCs at low temperature.

        <p>Moreover, the presence of carbon dioxide in air can greatly affect the performance of cells due to the formation of CO 3 2À ions. Such ions lower the overall conductivity, and in turn, performance of the cell. For this reason, most studies use pure oxygen as the oxidant in the cathodic side, whilst other studies focus on low or CO 2 -free air. This limits the applicability of such cells since pure oxygen is not as cost-effective compared to 'free' air. Suitable precautions must be introduced in order to use oxygen as a fuel since leakage is hard to contain and the gas is highly ammable. Uncontrollable release of oxygen can lead to explosions and lung suffocation. 246 Alternatively, the use of lowlevel CO 2 air requires extra cost input to lter, extract and store CO 2 , which may also hinder practicality. Removal of CO 2 from air is a possible solution but additional cost is involved for suitable chemicals and technology. 247 To truly appreciate ammonia-fed AMFC in everyday applications, more exible conditions must be explored. To fundamentally solve this problem, it is necessary to identify new OH À ion conductors beyond the scope of existing electrolyte materials that are compatible with CO 2 .
