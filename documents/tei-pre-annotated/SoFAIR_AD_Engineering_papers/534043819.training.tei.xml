        <p>Surface nanostructuring enables the manipulation of many essential surface properties. With the recent rapid advancements in laser technology, a contactless large-area processing at rates of up to m 2 s -1 becomes feasible that allows new industrial applications in medicine, optics, tribology, biology, etc. On the other hand, the last two decades enable extremely successful and intense research in the field of so-called laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS, ripples). Different types of these structures featuring periods of hundreds of nanometers only-far beyond the optical diffraction limit-up to several micrometers are easily manufactured in a single-step process and can be widely controlled by a proper choice of the laser processing conditions. From a theoretical point of view, however, a vivid and very controversial debate emerges, whether LIPSS originate from electromagnetic effects or are caused by matter reorganization. This article aims to close a gap in the available literature on LIPSS by reviewing the currently existent theories of LIPSS along with their numerical implementations and by providing a comparison and critical assessment of these approaches.Surface nanostructuring enables the manipulation of many essential surface properties.

        <p>Laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) are a phenomenon whose discovery dates back to the time when the first laser sources were developed. [1] Nowadays, it is well established that LIPSS can be fabricated on almost all types of materials (metals, semiconductors, dielectrics). They are generated within the focal spot of the linearly polarized laser radiation and can be characterized as a periodic modulation of the surface topography in DOI: 10.1002/lpor.202000215 the form of a regular grating. Based on their spatial period Œõ in relation to the utilized laser wavelength ùúÜ, LIPSS are divided into two groups: Low-spatial frequency LIPSS (LSFL) with Œõ &gt; ùúÜ/2 and high-spatial frequency LIPSS (HSFL) with Œõ &lt; ùúÜ/2. A sub-classification of the LSFL is based on the period of the structures and their orientation relative to the beam polarization direction, which are both determined by the electronic structure of the material and thus by the lasermatter interaction. While on strong absorbing materials, such as metals and semiconductors, LSFL are mainly characterized by Œõ ‚àº ùúÜ and an orientation perpendicular to the beam polarization (LSFL-I, see Figure 1a), on some large bandgap materials, such as fused silica, LIPSS are generated with Œõ ‚àº ùúÜ/n parallel to the beam polarization (LSFL-II, see Figure 1c). Here, n refers to the refractive index of the respective dielectric material. With the first observation of the filigree HSFL during the 1990s with a spatial period of a few hundreds of nanometers only, [2] research activities in the field of LIPSS-based surface nanostructuring have increased significantly. The rapidly growing interest was triggered on the one hand by the availability and reliability of ultrashort pulse lasers, as the HSFL are predominately observed for laser pulse durations in the fs-to ps-range. On the other hand, another important reason is related to the periodicities of this "nonclassical" type of LIPSS, which are significantly smaller than ùúÜ and thus allow laser-based nanostructuring far below the optical diffraction limit. According to the depth-to-period aspect ratio A, HSFL are classified into the types HSFL-I, with A &gt; 1 (Figure 1d), and HSFL-II, with A &lt; 1 (Figure 1b), respectively.Laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) are a phenomenon whose discovery dates back to the time when the first laser sources were developed.

        <p>During the following more than five decades, the topic LIPSS has evolved into a scientific evergreen. [15] While the early experi-mental observation of LIPSS has triggered a continuously evolving research interest, the groundbreaking studies performed independently during the eighties of the twentieth century by two north American groups brought a remarkable understanding of the formation mechanisms of "classical" near-wavelength sized LIPSS (LSFL) for laser pulses with durations down to the nanosecond regime. [16][17][18][19][20][21][22] At that time, these studies left not too many questions open in the field. Hence, during the following decade much less research focused on LIPSS until new research interest was initiated by the observation of a new type of "nonclassical" LIPSS with periods significantly smaller than the irradiation wavelength. [15] Figure 2 visualizes in a timeline diagram the historic developments of different approaches for explaining laser-induced periodic surface structures, ordered by modeled physical phenomena and simulation techniques applied. These different theories will be explained and discussed in more detail in the following Section 3.During the following more than five decades, the topic LIPSS has evolved into a scientific evergreen.

        <p>The currently existing theories on the formation of LIPSS can be divided in two different classes, i.e., i) electromagnetic theories describing the deposition of optical energy into the solid and ii) matter reorganization theories, which are based on the redistribution of surface near matter (Figure 3). One fundamental difference between both classes can be summarized as follows: while through electromagnetic scattering and absorption effects, the spatial signature of the final structures is already seeded during the laser irradiation, the reorganization of matter may take significantly longer (typically tens to hundreds of ps up to ms).The currently existing theories on the formation of LIPSS can be divided in two different classes, i.e., i) electromagnetic theories describing the deposition of optical energy into the solid and ii) matter reorganization theories, which are based on the redistribution of surface near matter (Figure 3).

        <p>Hence, for the irradiation of solids by ultrashort laser pulses with durations in the fs to ps range, both formation scenarios occur in temporally separated regimes, which allows to experimentally distinguish between them through time-resolved experiments.

        <p>Detailed electromagnetic theories on the formation of LIPSS, based on interference of electromagnetic radiation scattered at the microscopic rough surface, were developed during the eighties of the past century. [17,18,27] The basic idea behind these theories is sketched in Figure 4: During the laser irradiation the incident light scatters at the roughness of the sample surface (Figure 4a), e.g., via coherently driven elementary Huygens waves.

        <p>interference of the incident radiation with that emerging from scattering and SPPs leads to a spatial modulation of the local energy (fluence) distribution that-via absorption-is imprinted to the sample material (Figure 4c). For sufficiently strong laser excitation, the formation of the final periodic surface relief is then triggered, e.g., via spatially modulated material removal (ablation). Apart from the interference between the incident laser radiation and the electromagnetic field of the plasmons forming the primary LIPSS grating, additional second-order contributions may arise from the interference of (counter)propagating SPPs.

        <p>Some electromagnetic theories involve the excitation of different types of SEWs [28,29] including surface polaritons and specifically SPPs. [30] SPPs originate from delocalized coherent electron density oscillations and are bound to and propagate along the interface between two different media.

        <p>The corresponding theories are based on analytic mathematical equations. They often allow the prediction of LIPSS periods as function of specific irradiation parameters and material properties. However, they do not explicitly include feedback mechanisms describing pulse-to-pulse changes of the surface topography.The corresponding theories are based on analytic mathematical equations.

        <p>The most prominent (and simple) approach invokes the involvement of SPPs at the irradiated surface exposed to air/vacuum or another dielectric medium (e.g., a transparent liquid). For the excitation of SPPs, specific conditions on the dielectric permittivity of the two involved media have to be fulfilled. [32] For common metals (m) in contact with a dielectric (d, air or vacuum) exposed to laser wavelengths in the visible to IR spectral region, the condition for "SPP activity" can be simplified as Re(ùúñ m ) &lt; -1. [31,32] Particularly for irradiation with ultrashort laser pulses, this excitation channel is of major importance and may be enabled even for semiconductors and dielectrics as the initially plasmonically nonactive materials can transiently be turned into a metallic (SPP active) state, once a critical density of electrons in the conduction band is exceeded. [33,34] An important remark must be made regarding the excitability of SPPs on flat surfaces that points back to the momentum conservation law: for a given laser frequency, a photon propagating in free-space has a smaller momentum than an SPP as the two have different dispersion relations that do not cross. This momentum mismatch is the reason why free-space photons from air/vacuum cannot couple directly to SPPs. Hence, some additional surface roughness is required to support the coupling of light to SPPs here, manifesting in the experimental observation that LIPSS are usually a multi-pulse phenomenon in the ablative regime. The first pulses ablate some material and generate a surface roughness that may facilitate the excitation of SPPs. This inter-pulse feedback mechanism during repetitive irradiations selects specific spatial periods of the roughness distribution that can better absorb the laser radiation. [35] In the "standard SPP model of LIPSS," for simplicity the LIPSS (LSFL-I) period is directly linked through the SPP dispersion relation to its wavelength via Œõ LSFL = Œõ SPP . For the case of a plane dielectric-metal interface and for normal incident radiation, the latter can be calculated from the complex bulk dielectric permittivity of the metal (ùúñ m ) and the dielectric (ùúñ d ) and the laser wavelength ùúÜ as [29,31,36]The most prominent (and simple) approach invokes the involvement of SPPs at the irradiated surface exposed to air/vacuum or another dielectric medium (e.g., a transparent liquid).

        <p>This approximation may hold for a small number of laser pulses when surface corrugations of the LIPSS are still small (modulation depths h &lt;&lt; ùúÜ). However, once a sufficiently deep LIPSS relief is present at the surface, the simple expression of Œõ SPP given above is not valid anymore. [37,38] Thus, the applicability (surface modulation depth, interfacial SPP activity) of the simple "standard SPP model" always has to be checked carefully and is often questionable in the context of multi-pulse LIPSS experiments.This approximation may hold for a small number of laser pulses when surface corrugations of the LIPSS are still small (modulation depths h &lt;&lt; ùúÜ).

        <p>Variants of Equation (1) were used in different contexts to address the sub-wavelength characteristics of LIPSS (LSFL or HSFL) through changes in the dielectric permittivities. A straightforward approach lies in the modeling of the dielectric permittivity of the irradiated solid by a Drude model that predicts values of ùúñ as a function of the number of laser-excited carriers in the conduction band (for semiconductors and dielectrics) [34,[39][40][41] or even in sub-bands of the metallic band structure. [42] These intra-pulse changes can implicitly consider transient changes of the bulk optical properties of the material during laser irradiation. The model was applied also to layered systems treating the interfaces of films independently. [39] An extended thin-filmplasmonic model considering transient changes of the dielectric permittivities along with the electromagnetic coupling at the two interfaces was presented by Derrien et al. [43] Later it was transferred to oxidic films involved in the formation of a specific type of sub-ablative LIPSS on metals. [44] The experimentally observed alignment of the LSFL relative to the linear beam polarization results from the directional excitation of the electrons of the material by the incident laser radiation. Depending on the electrical properties (metallic, dielectric), this leads to a directional radiation characteristic (radiative and nonradiative scattered fields, propagation) and, thus, to a specific, anisotropic field distribution of the induced SEWs. [45][46][47] In the case of plasmonically active materials, it should also be noted that the excitation of SPPs requires the irradiation of a transverse magnetic (TM) wave, [31] which causes the polarization dependence of LSFL, e.g., on metals. [34] The SEW model can be extended to nonnormal incident radiation, where differences between s-and p-polarized light must be 2a) and (3a)). (Inspired by Figure 4 in Emmony et al.

        <p>Another approach for considering changes of the dielectric permittivities in Equation ( 1) or ( 2) is based on the effective medium theory. Hwang and Guo [49] proposed the use of modified values of ùúñ d and ùúâ to consider the nanoscale roughness of the air exposed LIPSS-covered surface. This was implemented by the Maxwell-Garnett theory modeling metallic nanostructure inclusions to the dielectric host air [50] for explaining deviations between the predictions of Equation (2a) from fs-laser irradiation experiments of Au and Pt. [49] Later, this effective medium approach was combined also by a Drude model. [51,52] Direct evidence for the involvement of SPPs in the LSFL-I formation was presented in complementary experimental approaches revealing the resonant absorption of radiation in prestructured surface gratings if SPPs can be excited. Garrelie et al. subjected a set of 10 nm shallow photolithographically manufactured linear surface gratings on nickel with discrete periods ranging between 440 and 800 nm to normal incident TM (polarization perpendicular to grating ridges) or transverse electric (TE)-polarized (polarization parallel to grating ridges) single 150 fs laser pulses with a center wavelength at ùúÜ = 800 nm. [36] Subwavelength-sized LSFL-I were produced for resonant grating coupling of TM-polarized radiation, confirming the predictions of Equation ( 1) when considering the transient changes of the dielectric permittivity of nickel. Later, Miyaji et al. used 66 nm deep photolithographic linear surface gratings of 1300 nm period on silicon in single-pulse excitation experiments (ùúÜ = 800 nm, ùúè = 100 fs) with orthogonal (s-/p-) polarization directions and different irradiation fluences. [53] Upon variation of the angle of incidence (ùúÉ), a pronounced surface reflectivity dip manifested at a resonance angle of ‚âà24¬∞only for the p-polarized radiation (TM-geometry) and at laser fluences sufficient to transiently turn the silicon into an SPP-active metallic state (see the statement above). Simultaneously, the post-laser irradiated grating depth increased to ‚âà400 nm, confirming the increased absorption through the grating-assisted SPP coupling. Complementary rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) simulations indicated an electromagnetic near-field enhancement through the SPPs at the geometrical edges of the grating ridges. Such polarizationdependent near-field enhancement effects at the grating-like surface topography may additionally facilitate the local material removal.

[49] Later, this effective medium approach was combined also by a Drude model. [51,52] Direct evidence for the involvement of SPPs in the LSFL-I formation was presented in complementary experimental approaches revealing the resonant absorption of radiation in prestructured surface gratings if SPPs can be excited. Garrelie et al. subjected a set of 10 nm shallow photolithographically manufactured linear surface gratings on nickel with discrete periods ranging between 440 and 800 nm to normal incident TM (polarization perpendicular to grating ridges) or transverse electric (TE)-polarized (polarization parallel to grating ridges) single 150 fs laser pulses with a center wavelength at ùúÜ = 800 nm. [36] Subwavelength-sized LSFL-I were produced for resonant grating coupling of TM-polarized radiation, confirming the predictions of Equation ( 1) when considering the transient changes of the dielectric permittivity of nickel. Later, Miyaji et al. used 66 nm deep photolithographic linear surface gratings of 1300 nm period on silicon in single-pulse excitation experiments (ùúÜ = 800 nm, ùúè = 100 fs) with orthogonal (s-/p-) polarization directions and different irradiation fluences. [53] Upon variation of the angle of incidence (ùúÉ), a pronounced surface reflectivity dip manifested at a resonance angle of ‚âà24¬∞only for the p-polarized radiation (TM-geometry) and at laser fluences sufficient to transiently turn the silicon into an SPP-active metallic state (see the statement above). Simultaneously, the post-laser irradiated grating depth increased to ‚âà400 nm, confirming the increased absorption through the grating-assisted SPP coupling. Complementary rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) simulations indicated an electromagnetic near-field enhancement through the SPPs at the geometrical edges of the grating ridges. Such polarizationdependent near-field enhancement effects at the grating-like surface topography may additionally facilitate the local material removal. [54,55]</p>
        <p>The currently most widely accepted theory on LIPSS was developed already during the eighties of the past century at the university of Toronto (Canada) in the group of van Driel and Sipe. Starting in 1982, this group published a series of pioneering papers [16,[18][19][20][21] involving LIPSS formation experiments [16,19,20] on various materials using ns-lasers along with a detailed electromagnetic theory. [18,45] At the same time, important contributions were made by the group around Fauchet and Siegman, who developed an alternative scattering/interference-based approach. [17,22] Starting from Maxwell's equations and using the Green's formalism, the work of Sipe and co-workers (in the following denoted for brevity as "Sipe theory") develops an integral equation of the dielectric polarization density at a microscopically rough surface, representing a general scattered-field model. It includes the possible excitation of SEWs (e.g., in the particular form of SPPs) and their interference with the incident radiation. Sipe's theory predicts possible wave vectors k of the LIPSS (related to their period via |k| = 2ùúã/Œõ) as function of surface parameters (surface roughness and bulk dielectric permittivity ùúñ) and laser irradiation parameters (wavelength, polarization direction, angle of incidence ùúÉ).

        <p>The pioneering publication [18] is not very convenient to use for the quantification of the efficacy factor for specific material and irradiation parameters. This drawback was removed by Bonse and co-workers, who published in 2005 a mathematical reformulation of ùúÇ (without changing its validity range) as a set of 14 complex-valued equations. [56] That set of equation allows a straightforward calculation of ùúÇ for s-or p-polarized radiation at the wavelength ùúÜ for a given dielectric permittivity ùúñ, angle of incidence ùúÉ, and two roughness parameters s and F encoding the topographical characteristics of the rough surface. The "standard values" of s and F are 0.4 and 0.1, respectively, as derived by Sipe and co-workers for surfaces with spherically shaped islands acting as scattering centers for the incident optical radiation. [18] On materials strongly absorbing the laser radiation such as metals and semiconductors, Sipe's theory typically predicts two dominant sickle-shaped features, which represent the LSFL (type LSFL-I) [15] with spatial periods close to the laser wavelength (Œõ LSFL-I ‚àº ùúÜ) and oriented perpendicular to the linear laser beam polarization (see Figure 1a). If the material is plasmonically active at ùúÜ, the peaks in ùúÇ are very narrow due to the resonant absorption of the radiation.The pioneering publication [18] is not very convenient to use for the quantification of the efficacy factor for specific material and irradiation parameters.

        <p>On transparent dielectrics, another dominant type of LSFL (type LSFL-II) [15] is predicted. These structures exhibit subwavelength periods close to Œõ LSFL-II ‚àº ùúÜ/Re(‚àöùúñ) = ùúÜ/n (with n being the refractive index of the material) and are oriented parallel to the laser beam polarization (see Figure 1c). In Sipe's theory, LSFL-II are related to so-called radiation remnants (RR) and originate from a specific nonpropagating electromagnetic mode close to the rough surface.

        <p>A direct comparison of the curves of both LSFL features reveals that both, the maximum amplitude of ùúÇ max and the corresponding refractive indices are different: while ùúÇ max (LSFL-I, black line) stays below ‚âà0.3 at a refractive index of n ‚àº 1.8, ùúÇ max (LSFL-II, blue line) reaches more than three times larger values of ‚âà1.075 at a lower value of n ‚àº 1.45. In other words, a larger energy deposition is predicted by Sipe's theory for the LSFL-II structures, particularly for low refractive index dielectric materials. The dominance of the LSFL-II structures with periods close to ùúÜ/n and oriented parallel to the laser beam polarization manifests experimentally particularly for low-index dielectrics with large bandgap energies (requiring multi-photon absorption to be involved). [5,[57][58][59][60][61] The most prominent example is the material silicon dioxide in the form of amorphous fused silica or single-crystalline quartz. At 800 nm wavelength, their refractive index (n = 1.453) matches well the position of ùúÇ max (LSFL-II), see Figure 6. It was shown in a series of publications that the experimentally observed LSFL-II are seeded in the transparency regime of the material through an interplay of the microscopic surface roughness causing farfield scattering and interference with the laser radiation propagating in the material (see Section 3.1.3 and Rudenko et al. [46] ) and sub-surface incubation effects. The latter are triggered by the excitation of self-trapped excitons as indicated in time-resolved trans-illumination pump-probe diffraction experiments. [4] The LSFL-II then finally manifests as surface relief upon multi-pulse irradiation. [61] While the polarization direction, the angle of incidence, and the surface roughness of the nonirradiated surface usually can be considered as constant during the laser processing, the dielectric permittivity ùúñ can undergo large changes-particularly when semiconductors or dielectrics are irradiated by high-intensity laser pulses allowing multi-photon absorption processes. For these materials, a transient metallization of the surface may occur, potentially featuring SPP activity. The effect occurs if a sufficient number of valence band electrons of the solid is promoted via interband transitions into its conduction band (CB). The associated changes of ùúñ then occur during the laser pulse and, hence, represent an intra-pulse feedback process. This mechanism was studied in detail by Bonse and co-workers in 2009 for two different materials, who combined the Sipe theory with a simple Drude model allowing to quantify the change of ùúñ as a function of the number density of electrons N e promoted into the CB of zinc oxide [62] or silicon. [33,63] This extension of Sipe's theory is called Sipe-Drude model and was later adopted for other materials. [61,[64][65][66][67][68][69][70] At normal laser beam incidence (ùúÉ = 0¬∞), the Sipe-Drude model reveals that for increasing electron densities in the CB of semiconductors [33,68] or dielectrics, [61,62] the LSFL-II (RR) feature changes its shape/position and finally diminishes, while the LSFL-I (SEW/SPP) feature becomes very pronounced with large amplitudes, once the irradiated material turns plasmonically active through an increased extinction. At very high values of N e , all peaks disappear and ùúÇ becomes widely constant and approaches zero. This is fully in line with the experimental observation that LIPSS are formed solely in a certain excitation (fluence) regime close to the damage/ablation threshold of the material.A direct comparison of the curves of both LSFL features reveals that both, the maximum amplitude of ùúÇ max and the corresponding refractive indices are different: while ùúÇ max (LSFL-I, black line) stays below ‚âà0.3 at a refractive index of n ‚àº 1.8, ùúÇ max (LSFL-II, blue line) reaches more than three times larger values of ‚âà1.075 at a lower value of n ‚àº 1.45.

        <p>A first adoption of a theoretical model of volumetric nanogratings to surface ripples on (semi)transparent materials was presented by Buividas et al. in 2011. [88] In this approach, the HSFL are formed from plasma nanospheres localized in the bulk of the irradiated material at the pre-breakdown conditions, i.e., when the global electron plasma density is lower than the critical value. The surface ripples are then pinned to the smallest possible standing wave cavity inside the material of refractive index n, defining the corresponding HSFL-I period Œõ = ùúÜ/(2n), sketched in Figure 9.

        <p>As pointed out by Rudenko et al. [46] for dielectrics, both nanostructures (type-r HSFL-I and volume nanogratings) share the same formation mechanism and originate from the interference between the incident electromagnetic field and the nonradiative near-field coherently scattered at surface defects. This intra-pulse scattering process does not require the fs-laser-irradiated dielectric to turn entirely into a metallic state. It relies on the existence of nanoscopic local defects that promote locally enhanced absorption, field-enhancement, and scattering. The spatial period of the HSFL-I is usually close to ùúÜ/[2n] = ùúÜ/[2Re(‚àöùúñ)]. In contrast to the HSFL-I, the type-d LSFL-II with periods of ‚àºùúÜ/n = ùúÜ/Re(‚àöùúñ) are seeded a few hundreds of nanometers below the surface by the interference of the incident light with the radiative scattered fields, decaying slower (i.e., with ‚âà1/r, r: radial distance) [89] than the nonradiative near-fields (decaying with ‚âà1/r 3 ) [89] for increasing depths from the surface. Via repetitive fs-laser irradiation and incubation effects (inter-pulse feedback), the LSFL-II become visible at the surface once the covering near-surface material is removed through ablation. Note that the depth at which the LSFL-II are formed in dielectrics is located in the radiative intermediate region that is separating the regimes of nonradiative near-field scattering [r &lt; ùúÜ/(2ùúã)] and radiative far-field scattering [r &gt; 2ùúÜ]. [89] That scenario is illustrated in the collage presented in Figure 10. In the SEM micrograph shown in Figure 10c, LSFL-II appear in the center at the bottom of the ablation crater formed in silica after irradiation by 20 consecutive fs-laser pulses with a spatially Gaussian beam profile at 5.8 J cm -2 peak fluence. Within an annulus around the LSFL-II-covered center the HSFL-I are present close to the sample surface. Figure 10a,b,d,e provides the corresponding calculated electron density profilescolored as a function of depth in (d) or encoding the normalized electron density in (a), (b), and (e)-where the co-existing spatial signatures of the LSFL-II and HSFL-I are evident. Their orthogonal orientation is finally a consequence of the spatial scattering characteristics of sub-wavelength surface defects along with the optical properties of the irradiated material (dielectric vs metallic, see Fig. 2 in Rudenko et al.

        <p>The ability of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses to drive the electronic system of a solid into a state not being in equilibrium with the lattice and to induce a collectively coupled behavior of these electrons (such as in SPPs) allows to adapt methods that were initially developed in the field of plasma physics. One method proposed already in 1955-even before the broad availability of modern computers-is called PIC. [96] PIC relies on the calculation of trajectories of charged particles in self-consistent electromagnetic (or -static) fields that are computed on a fixed (Eulerian) mesh. The method typically implements interactively the following procedures: i) integration of the equations of motion that are including Lorentzian forces (solved by the "particle mover" code), ii) interpolation of charge and current source terms to the field mesh, iii) computation of the electromagnetic fields on the mesh points via Maxwell's equations (implemented through the "field solver" code), iv) interpolation of the electromagnetic fields from the mesh to the particle locations, etc. For [95] Copyright 2020, The Authors, published by

        <p>One particularity of the interaction of fs-laser pulses with solids is caused by their extremely short pulse duration along with the fact that the intra-pulse absorption of the laser radiation occurs via the electrons of the solid. If the duration of the laser pulses is shorter than the electron-phonon coupling time (ùúè e-ph ), i.e., the time required to transfer absorbed energy from the electronic system to the lattice of the solid, the absorbed laser pulse energy remains locally confined during the interaction and does not spread through heat diffusion into the area surrounding the laser-excited region. ùúè e-ph depends on the material and is typically ranging between 0.1 and 10 ps. The electron-phonon coupling mechanism imposes some constraints on the formation of LIPSS, particularly the experimentally observed lower limit of spatial periods of the HSFL, which account to several tens of nanometers. As proposed by Bonse et al., this limit is caused by thermal diffusion effects that are washing out too small spatial modulations in the absorbed energy during the transfer of the energy from the optically excited electronic system to the lattice of the solid. [15] The question if a spatial modulation of the absorbed optical energy can "survive" the electron-phonon relaxation processes was already addressed by Derrien et al. with a model considering the interference of the laser irradiation with an SEW propagating on the surface of fs-laser-excited silicon, the associated laser energy absorption and free carrier formation, and subsequent energy relaxation via electron-phonon coupling. [103] This was numerically implemented through TTM.

        <p>Early ideas connected the LIPSS topography to hydrodynamic effects that are frozen upon re-solidification of the laser-excited surface. Possible mechanisms were proposed to be based on surface tension gradients, [113] thermoelastically generated surface acoustic waves (SAWs), [114,115] or capillary waves (CWs). [27,116] The idea behind the thermoelastically generated SAWs can be summarized as follows: the (linear) absorption of the laser radiation by the solid occurs in the near-surface layer (usually &lt; 1 ùúám in depth). Within this layer, the deposited energy creates an exponential profile of the carrier density and lattice temperature and the associated strain field. The spatially varying strain field couples to SAWs of appropriate spatial frequency. For small laser spot sizes, a strong transversal component of the strain field is present then. Its spectrum of spatial frequencies can provide a propagating component of the SAWs. Phase transitions such as melting often involve discontinuous mass density changes (e.g., crystalline silicon densifies by a several percent upon melting). The spatio-temporal dynamics of the propagating melt-in or resolidification front may additionally contribute to the excitation of SAWs.Early ideas connected the LIPSS topography to hydrodynamic effects that are frozen upon re-solidification of the laser-excited surface.

Phase transitions such as melting often involve discontinuous mass density changes (e.g., crystalline silicon densifies by a several percent upon melting). The spatio-temporal dynamics of the propagating melt-in or resolidification front may additionally contribute to the excitation of SAWs.</p>

        <p>In most recent approaches, hydrodynamic theories were numerically combined with electromagnetic theories of electromagnetic material excitation and heat transfer and its dissipation. Both, incompressible [109,110] and compressible NSE-based hydrodynamic approaches were developed, [91,108] for an assessment of the specific differences between both NSE models, see Section 4.2. Including multi-pulse feedback, some authors discussed a convection-role mechanism based on the Marangoni effect that may account for supra-wavelength periodic structures, such as supra-wavelength LSFL or grooves. [92,108,111,118] However, when hydrodynamic theories based on the compressible NSEs are used in combination with a 3D-FDTD model, including as input the absorbed energy densities deposited by ultrashort laser pulses via electromagnetic scattering, many experimental findings can be reproduced. [91] Using the same multi-physical approach (i.e., 3D-FDTD for solving the Maxwell equations, coupled with a TTM and compressible NSE, supported by the EOS), the same authors provided the missing explicit link between the electromagnetic and hydrodynamic LIPSS scenarios by elucidating in detail the role of different hydrodynamic instabilities following the electromagnetic excitation processes of fs-laser-irradiated Nickel surfaces (ùúÜ = 400 nm/800 nm, 0.15-0.5 J cm -2 , N = 1-5, ùúè = 80 fs, ùúÉ = 0¬∞). [108] The simulations revealed that strong electromagnetic field enhancement at surface defects, local heat confinement, and the excitation of a sub-surface rarefaction wave trigger the Marangoni convection instability and finally result in the destabilization of a thin laser-induced melt layer. A polarization dependence of the hydrodynamic melt flows is imposed by the polarization dependence of the optical absorption in the vicinity of local bumps or surface holes that generate local temperature gradients and initial perturbations being asymmetric in the surface plane. No evidence for the involvement of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in the melt layer was found. In absence of polarizationdependent gradients in the melt, i.e., at fluences only slightly exceeding the melting threshold, quasi-hexagonal convection cells with sub-wavelengths dimensions were found-in accordance with experiments. [108] Apart from identifying the relevance of the different physical mechanisms, these simulations also allowed to study the dynamics of the LIPSS formation. Particularly, it was shown that for laser fluences leading to HSFL-II, after the absorption and nonradiative scattering of the incident laser pulses at the rough surface (2% coverage with nanobumps and nanoholes of R = 5 nm radius), the interfacial melt-in and the counter-propagating rarefaction wave propagating through the excited material leads within 15-25 ps to destabilization of the system that initiates Marangoni flows. The latter shapes the HSFL pattern featuring periods between 60 and 180 nm and is most pronounced between 50 and 100 ps before interfacial solidification starts. Typical Marangoni numbers were estimated to be Ma ‚àº 0.4-2. The re-solidification process terminates about 250-500 ps after the laser excitation (depending on the laser fluence). It was concluded that for metals, the HSFL-II periods are imposed by hydrodynamic effects and, therefore, rather independent on the irradiation wavelength. [108] Using fused silica as an example, a model of thermoconvective transport based on the incompressible NSE was used to calculate possible periodicities that can emerge by the development of thermo-capillary instabilities in a horizontal liquid layer heated by fs-laser irradiation from the free-surface side. [67] Considering the temperature-dependent surface tension ùúé(T) and viscosity ùúá(T), the growth rate ùõæ of these instabilities was calculated as a function of the liquid molten layer thickness h and the mode periodicity Œõ for T = 2000 K (Figure 17). The calculations predict an increase of the period of the fastest developing mode with increasing h allowing to explain both, sub-and supra-wavelength LIPSS experimentally observed on fused silica. [67,111] For relevant layer thicknesses, the calculated values of ùõæ correspond to time durations ùõæ -1 ‚àº 10 -12 to 10 -10 s (i.e., 1-100 ps), which are smaller than melt lifetimes in the order of ùúás reported for fs-laser ablation of glasses.

[120,121] The theory is based on the intensive laser-induced formation of nonequilibrium defects (e.g., interstitials, vacancies, voids, and dislocations) in a sub-surface layer of nm-thickness, in which a fluctuating local increase in defect concentration causes a corrugation of the surface relief and the corresponding surface strain (Figure 18). [122] Consequently, the structure formation was described as a result of laser-driven surface instabilities that develop due to the interaction of the defect concentration field with the self-consistent deformation of the elastic continuum of the host material. In this context, an important scaling parameter that determines the spatial periods of the corrugated surface topography was attributed to the thickness h of the defect-enriched near-surface layer. [122] Later, the group around Reif and co-workers at the University of Cottbus, Germany, used the self-organization to describe the formation of LIPSS on wide bandgap materials such as BaF 2 and CaF 2 upon fs-laser irradiation. [123,124] The methodology was triggered mainly by the similarity of the experimentally observed structures with surface pattern induced by ion beam sputtering. Based on the detailed investigation of the interaction of high-power laser radiation with the aforementioned dielectric materials, [125] the generation and accumulation of local defects was also considered as a central aspect during structure formation. [126] According to this self-organization model, fs-laser irradiation initially leads to a rapid excitation of the electrons of the material during the pulse duration. The redistribution of this energy results in a softening of the atomic bonds and consequently in a destabilization of the crystal lattice in a thin surface layer (see Figure 3b). This disturbed system is in a highly unstable state, far away from thermodynamic equilibrium, whose degree of disturbance is further enhanced by the emission of individual components such as electrons, ions, atoms, and clusters.

[131] The forces acting between the atoms and their potential energies are usually calculated by means of suitable empiric interatomic potentials. In this way, from a large ensemble of atoms macroscopic reorganization of matter based on microscopic interaction mechanisms can be tracked in time. Considering the computational resources typically required, MD simulations are nowadays limited to sizes of several hundreds of nanometers in all spatial dimensions and to simulated time spans up to several nanoseconds. If periodic boundary conditions can be assumed spatially, larger simulated dimensions can be realized. A crucial point in MD is the choice of interatomic potentials, which serve to compute the collective motion of all individual atoms. Time-independent potentials are often not suitable to consider the strong electronic excitation processes changing transiently the material properties upon high intensity laser irradiation particularly of semiconductors and dielectrics. Thus, they cannot properly account for rapid processes such as nonthermal or thermal melting occurring at fluences of the order of the ablation threshold, i.e., in the regime of LIPSS formation. In order to consider the transient changes in these materials, different interatomic potentials were calculated based on different microscopic electronic models, based on tight-binding theory [132] or by ab initio calculations using finite temperature density functional theory. [133] For metals, timeindependent embedded atom models (EAMs) were used. [134] In 2015, Ivanov et al.

The authors implemented a 248 nm wavelength two-beam direct laser interference patterning scenario, where the interaction of a single 1.6 ps laser pulse with an Au target is simulated in air environment for time spans up to 500 ps. The two-beam interference imposed at the surface a sinusoidally modulated laser intensity pattern of 500 nm spatial period. The incident laser fluences were chosen below 0.4 J cm -2 near the damage threshold of the material, i.e., above the melting but below the threshold fluence of macroscopic ablation.

Based on their simulations, the authors identified three competing mechanisms involved in the process of nanostructuring bulk Au targets by an ultrashort single UV laser pulse near the damage threshold: i) Under conditions of inertial stress confinement, the relaxation of laser-induced compressive stresses promotes the formation of sub-surface voids inside the molten part of the material at the areas with the highest incident energy. ii) The induced tensile stresses relax through the formation of voids. That relaxation establishes some hydrodynamic motion in the upper part of the liquid, finally resulting in the growth of surface structures. iii) Simultaneously, electron heat conduction into the bulk of the target causes strong cooling of the elevating surface structures and manifests in rapid surface solidification.approach to the early stage of LIPSS formation.

        <p>In 2017, the authors extended their MD-TTM simulations by implementing a comparison of the patterning of Au in air and with a 400 nm thick confining water layer both upon irradiation with single ultrashort laser pulses (400 fs duration, 248 nm wavelength) at maximum incident fluences between 0.16 and 0.25 J cm -2 distributed in 270 nm periodic beam patterns. [136] The results can be summarized as follows: the presence of a water confinement layer leads to a significant suppression of growing nanofeatures, finally resulting in a smoother structured surface when compared to irradiation in air. Due to the higher cooling rates, the water layer promotes a significantly faster solidification of the growing tip of the nanostructures. Moreover, at the given applied fluences, the formation of liquid metal droplets is suppressed in the water environment. Therefore, the resulting nanostructured surfaces are widely free of redeposited metal nanoparticles. The MD-TTM simulations of Shih et al. underlined the role of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the water/metal interface for the disintegration of the melt layer into nanoparticles for fs-laser irradiation of silver at higher laser fluences. [137] Shugaev et al. employed a similar EAM interatomic potentialbased MD-TTM simulation of the dynamics of single fs-laser pulse-induced phase transitions, material decomposition, and subsequent solidification of the metal Cr in air/vacuum triggered at fluences in the ablation regime. [112] Starting from a periodically modulated beam profile (of 260 nm lateral period, 200 fs pulse duration, 258 nm wavelength) with absorbed fluences ranging between 0.2 and 0.3 J cm -2 sufficient for phase explosion, spatially modulated ablation triggers a complex interplay of material removal and redistribution finally leading to the formation of surface features protruding above the original surface of the target. The authors pointed out that lateral pressure gradients in the ablation plume drive the vapor and liquid droplets of Cr toward the regions located above the minima of the laser energy deposition at the target surface. As a consequence of material redistribution, elongated liquid walls protruding up to ‚âà600 nm above the surface are transiently formed. The upper part of these liquid walls further disintegrates into nanoscale droplets, while the base of the wall solidifies within ‚âà2 ns, finally forming surface features of ‚âà100 nm height (see Figure 20). These MD simulations suggest that the redistribution of material from the lower lying part of the ablation plume plays a major role in the formation of the final surface protrusions. In contrast, the liquid flow in the molten regions of the sample that are subjected to the recoil pressure of the ablated material makes a minor contribution to the LIPSS formation only.In 2017, the authors extended their MD-TTM simulations by implementing a comparison of the patterning of Au in air and with a 400 nm thick confining water layer both upon irradiation with single ultrashort laser pulses (400 fs duration, 248 nm wavelength) at maximum incident fluences between 0.16 and 0.25 J cm -2 distributed in 270 nm periodic beam patterns.

For more details, the reader is referred to Raether [31] and Derrien et al. [32] ‚Ä¢ Another common mistake arises from the fact that, via positive inter-pulse feedback, the spatial LIPSS period usually depends on the number of pulses applied per irradiated spot: many authors determined spatial LIPSS periods from multipulse experiments and then use Equation ( 1) to retrieve the (transient) dielectric permittivity of the irradiated material. However, this approach usually fails since for strong absorbing materials such as metals and semiconductors, the LIPSS period decreases by several tens of percent with increasing number of pulses per spot (see Figure 13).

They justify this assumption by the formation of a standing plasmon wave that is created by two counter propagating SPPs. While this modified Equation (1) often seems to fit the experimentally determined LSFL periods better, the precise realization of that standing wave condition of anti-collinear SPPs excited at different and randomly distributed surface defects is still left open.

        <p>‚Ä¢ Some additional limitations of the Sipe theory (see Section 3.1.2) should be mentioned here. The derivation of the analytical expressions behind Equation ( 4) is based on some mathematical linearizations through developments into Taylor series. This implies that the theory remains restricted to a near-surface layer, the so-called selvedge region. The extent l S of that region has to fulfill two conditions. [18,72] First, the selvedge thickness must be small compared to the laser wavelength (2ùúãl S /ùúÜ &lt;&lt; 1), and second, l S must be small compared to the periodicity of the inhomogenous energy absorption (|k|l S &lt;&lt; 1, with k being the LIPSS wave vector). The latter condition implies that HSFL may be too small to be properly described by the Sipe theory. Another particularity of Sipe's theory is that the surface roughness is implicitly encoded by two specific surface parameters, the shape factor s and the filling factor F, that cannot be easily adapted to pulse-to-pulse changes of the surface topography. So far, the latter has prevented that inter-pulse feedback through a changing surface roughness could be directly included in the Sipe theory. ‚Ä¢ FDTD simulations are an extremely powerful approach to calculate the electromagnetic fields at almost arbitrary rough surfaces and to predict the resulting localized absorption of energy in the irradiated material underneath. A direct relation to physical effects, however, is often very difficult and requires a very careful analysis and interpretation of physical effects that may be involved. Moreover, numerical influences of spatial and temporal limitations must always be carefully checked. ‚Ä¢ Under certain conditions, the electromagnetic scattering characteristics leading to the formation of LIPSS can be observed already in single-pulse irradiation experiments. [33,48,139] Often, this occurs at surface defects allowing an increased local absorption at local fluences close to the damage or ablation threshold of the irradiated materials. Some authors, however, report single-pulse LIPSS (LSFL-I) at very high fluences (up to 100 times the ablation threshold). Here, the presence of postpulses or that of a temporally broad optical pulse pedestal (e.g., arising from amplified spontaneous emission) being capable to exceed the ablation threshold of the excited material must be carefully checked in the experiments.

        <p>‚Ä¢ One of the most crucial and diversely discussed aspects is related to the experimentally proven relationship between the orientation of the LIPSS and the direction of the laser beam polarization. [15,80,81] Without the additional input of electromagnetic theories, most matter reorganization theories cannot convincingly explain the general coupling of the direction of LIPSS, which is usually either perpendicular or parallel to the laser beam polarization. Some of the matter reorganization theories may, however, explain certain observations of subwavelength or supra-wavelength LIPSS, which are formed in annular patterns or around the laser-irradiated spots and are not related to the laser polarization. [116] ‚Ä¢ One of the prerequisites of forming LIPSS via matter reorganization is a sufficient long lifetime of the material surface in an excited state allowing for significant material transport. While this condition may be fulfilled for laser irradiation times (pulse durations) in the ùúás-range or even longer, it may not be valid for short (ns) or ultrashort (fs-ps) laser pulses. For semiconductors, the melt duration of the surface after fs-laser irradiation at fluences close to the ablation threshold typically ranges between a few and several tens of nanoseconds. [117,140] For metals (dielectrics), due to the higher (lower) heat conductivities, these durations are usually smaller (larger [119] ). ‚Ä¢ For hydrodynamic melt flows originating from the Marangoni effect, a simple estimate of the characteristic time scale required to transport some material over a radial distance L on a molten layer of average thickness h m can be calculated via [119] ùúè‚Ä¢ One of the most crucial and diversely discussed aspects is related to the experimentally proven relationship between the orientation of the LIPSS and the direction of the laser beam polarization.

        <p>It is known from a large amount of available experimental LIPSS studies that for each material their formation and appearance depend crucially on several key parameters, such as irradiation wavelength, polarization, fluence, number of pulses, angle of incidence, and the ambient environment. [13,15,143] Most of these parameters were already introduced and discussed in Section 3. Some of these parameters are rather easy to determine and control, while others must be carefully analyzed to allow a relation with theories. The following part sheds some light on aspects that should be considered when comparing theoretical and experimental results on LIPSS. That includes particularly the usage of different definitions of key laser and processing parameters, such as the terms intensity/fluence, the number of (effective) pulses, and their relation to distinct threshold fluences.It is known from a large amount of available experimental LIPSS studies that for each material their formation and appearance depend crucially on several key parameters, such as irradiation wavelength, polarization, fluence, number of pulses, angle of incidence, and the ambient environment.

        <p>‚Ä¢ Energy deposition is the key in the formation of LIPSS. While some publications in the context of LIPSS just specify the measured laser pulse energy (E, in [J]), a more meaningful parameter is the single-pulse laser fluence [J cm -2 , areal energy density] incident to the surface, as it already considers the laser beam focusing conditions. Some authors alternatively specify the intensity [W cm -2 , areal power density] of a single laser pulse. Often LIPSS do not strongly depend on the laser pulse duration and the fluences can be straightforwardly calculated from the pulse intensity as its product with pulse duration (with some correction factors close to unity). Since real laser sources usually emit spatially Gaussian laser beams without a sharp boundary, it must be specified whether the peak fluence (œï 0 ) or the average fluence (œï = œï 0 /2) are used (the same for intensities). Moreover, since Gaussian beams are relying on some particular definitions, it must be specified whether the laser beam waist radius (w 0 ) at the sample surface refers to the 1/e-or the 1/e 2 -decay length of the spatial intensity/fluence profile. This choice then determines whether œï 0 = E/(ùúã w 0 2 ), or œï 0 = 2E/(ùúã w 0 2 ) should be used for the calculation of the peak fluence from the experimentally measured pulse energy.‚Ä¢ Energy deposition is the key in the formation of LIPSS.

However, while this reduces the number of specified parameters, this parameter must be taken with care since material-specific thresholds are involved in LIPSS formation (see below). Just to illustrate the problem of this oversimplification here: the surface morphologies caused by a certain number of laser pulses at a fluence, e.g., one to two times the threshold for twice the number of pulses, are very different from that obtained at twice that number of pulses at half the fluence, i.e., below the threshold. ‚Ä¢ The generation of LIPSS with a spatially varying fluence profile œï(x,y) results in other aspects that must be considered with care. LIPSS are usually a multi-pulse phenomenon, where inter-pulse feedback plays an important role (as already discussed above). For the irradiation of a single spot at the surface by N consecutive laser pulses, each location is hit N-times with the identical fluence value. As a consequence, distinct, spatially separated surface regions covered by different types of LIPSS (HSL, LSFL, grooves, etc.) can be distinguished. This situation is physically different from what is realized upon scan-processing of 1D lines, that are typically performed at a constant scan velocity (v x , e.g., in the x-direction) within a line. 2D areas can be processed by meandering displacement of such lines in the orthogonal y-direction (at a selected offset Œîy). Here, for line-scanning with a nonzero pulse-to-pulse spot overlap (0 &lt; Œîx &lt; 2w 0 ), a fixed location at the surface is first exposed to a reduced local laser fluence from the rising edge of the discretely displaced spatially Gaussian laser beam profile, before further increased fluence values from the most intense part and finally from the falling edge of the laser beam profile hit the specific location (depending on the value of Œîx). If 2D areas with nonzero line-overlap (0 &lt; Œîy &lt; 2w 0 ) are processed, additional exposures manifest at the selected surface location through the scanning of multiple overlapping lines (depending on the value of Œîy). In such a scanning approach, surface structures formed in the high fluence part of the scanned laser-beam can later be "overwritten" by the low fluence tail of the Gaussian beam profile, often resulting in hierarchical micro-nano-structures with different types of LIPSS being superimposed. [143] To at least roughly allow for some inter-comparison of spot, line, and area processing with a pulsed laser beam (repetition frequency (f rep )), the concept of effective number of laser pulses per beam spot area is often used [144,145] N eff ,1D = 2w 0 Œîx = 2w 0 ‚ãÖ f rep v x (10)sometimes referred to as dose) as the product between the (peak) fluence per pulse and the number of applied pulses (œï acc = œï 0 √ó N).

If 2D areas with nonzero line-overlap (0 &lt; Œîy &lt; 2w 0 ) are processed, additional exposures manifest at the selected surface location through the scanning of multiple overlapping lines (depending on the value of Œîy). In such a scanning approach, surface structures formed in the high fluence part of the scanned laser-beam can later be "overwritten" by the low fluence tail of the Gaussian beam profile, often resulting in hierarchical micro-nano-structures with different types of LIPSS being superimposed. [143] To at least roughly allow for some inter-comparison of spot, line, and area processing with a pulsed laser beam (repetition frequency (f rep )), the concept of effective number of laser pulses per beam spot area is often used [144,145] N eff ,1D = 2w 0 Œîx = 2w 0 ‚ãÖ f rep v x (10)</p>
        <p>However, it is important to underline that N, N eff,1D , and N eff,2D cannot simply be considered as "the same parameter considering the number of laser pulse exposures." None of the available microscopic LIPSS theories includes such laser beam scanning effects, although the theoretical approaches of Eichst√§dt et al. [146] and Mezera et al. [147] based on accumulated fluences can be used to empirically predict experimental parameter ranges for processing of homogenous areas of LIPSS. ‚Ä¢ Regardless the laser processing strategy, it is an experimental fact that LIPSS are most pronounced in specific fluence and pulse number ranges. These regimes strongly depend on the irradiated materials and are usually associated with certain material-specific modification thresholds, such as the fluence thresholds of melting or ablation that are usually associated with phase transitions in the irradiated material. In dielectrics, nonlinear absorption/ionization phenomena driving the conduction band electron density above a critical value impose a threshold. Sometimes other crucial parameters such as the chemical bond energy of organic polymers were identified. [148] It is essential to note that the same physical mechanisms leading to periodic energy localization (such as, e.g., the excitation of SEWs/SPPs and the interference of their electromagnetic field with the incident laser radiation) can even result in different manifestations of the LIPSS: while in the ablative regime, a periodic surface topography relief (LSFL-I) is formed through localized material removal, [33] at lower fluences in the melting regime, the rapid resolidification of the locally molten material can induce structural changes, such as amorphization, leaving behind an almost flat surface with a strong periodic modulation of the optical surface reflectivity.

        <p>After more than five decades of research on LIPSS, including an ongoing revival of the research interest at the turn of the millennium, the current status of knowledge can be summarized as follows: The "battle"/competition of the different LIPSS theories (electromagnetics vs matter reorganization) is almost over. Both theoretical approaches are currently merging into a coherent view on these surface nanostructures, where, depending on the materials and irradiation conditions, aspects supporting one of the two theory classes can dominate the experimental observations. While in most cases, the LIPSS characteristics are seeded through different excitation/absorption channels in an ultrafast manner already during the irradiation via electromagnetic scattering and interference effects at the rough surface, relevant hydrodynamic motions and diffusion effects may contribute on longer timescales up to the ms-range (dependingAfter more than five decades of research on LIPSS, including an ongoing revival of the research interest at the turn of the millennium, the current status of knowledge can be summarized as follows: The "battle"/competition of the different LIPSS theories (electromagnetics vs matter reorganization) is almost over.
