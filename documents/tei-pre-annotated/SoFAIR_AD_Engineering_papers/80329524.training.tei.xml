        <p>Formal decision-making methods can be used to help improve the overall sustainability of industries and organisations. Recently, there has been a great proliferation of works aggregating sustainability criteria by using diverse multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A number of review papers summarising these techniques have been published. During the past few years, new approaches for hybrid MCDM (HMCDM) methods have been developed, but they have not yet been completely reviewed. This article aims to fill this gap and to summarise publications related to the application of HMCDM. The current study is limited solely to papers available in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection database. The main findings report that HMCDM methods have been increasingly applied for supporting decisions in different domains of sustainability. The most frequently used methods emphasise the advantages of hybrid approaches over individual methods, and we conclude that they can assist decision-makers in handling information such as stakeholders' preferences, interconnected or contradictory criteria, and uncertain environments. The main contribution of this work is identifying hybrid approaches as improvements for decision-making related to sustainability issues, while also promoting future application of the approaches.Formal decision-making methods can be used to help improve the overall sustainability of industries and organisations.

        <p>The concept of sustainability has become one of the most important objectives in many activities because of greater concerns for environmental protection and social responsibility. In modern economies, financial aspirations must be balanced with social and environmental interests. To address potentially contradictory concerns and to achieve good compromise solutions, it is helpful to evaluate sustainable production and management strategies by applying formal decision-making methods.The concept of sustainability has become one of the most important objectives in many activities because of greater concerns for environmental protection and social responsibility.

        <p>Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) models have grown as a part of operation research, combining mathematical and computational tools to provide a subjective evaluation of performance criteria by decision-makers (Mardani, Jusoh, &amp; Zavadskas, 2015).Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) models have grown as a part of operation research, combining mathematical and computational tools to provide a subjective evaluation of performance criteria by decision-makers (Mardani, Jusoh, &amp; Zavadskas, 2015).</p>
        <p>The first references that address multiple criteria mathematical methods to support decisions emerged as far back as the eighteenth century (De Condorcet, 1785;Franklin, 1772). In the nineteenth century, the works of Edgeworth (1881) and Pareto (1896) made significant contributions. The first decision-making axioms were presented in the twentieth century by Ramsey (1931). Soon, Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) announced the Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. Ten scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for the creation of a decision-making theoretical framework (Arrow, 1951;Danzig, 1948;Debreu, 1959;Frisch, 1961;Kantorovich, 1960;Koopmans, 1951;Nash, 1950;Samuelson, 1938;Sen, 1970;Simon, 1955). In the same period, a number of other important works related to decision-making theory were published (Edwards, 1954;Fishburn, 1970;Gass &amp; Saaty, 1955;Luce &amp; Raiffa, 1957;Roy, 1968;Zadeh, 1965;Zelany, 1974).The first references that address multiple criteria mathematical methods to support decisions emerged as far back as the eighteenth century (De Condorcet, 1785;Franklin, 1772).

        <p>The title MCDM was first suggested in 1975 (Zeleny, 1975). Four years later, this new notion was explained by Zionts (1979) and gained universal recognition. MCDM methods can be classified into discrete multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) methods (Hwang &amp; Yoon, 1981) and continuous multiple objective decision-making (MODM) methods (Hwang &amp; Masud, 1979). The theory of MCDM was summarised by the author of the term (Zeleny, 1982).The title MCDM was first suggested in 1975 (Zeleny, 1975).

        <p>Since 1990, MCDM methods have rapidly developed and have been applied to support strategic decisions in different areas. Developments and applications of MCDM methods have been summarised by a number of authors (Roy, 1996;Saaty, 1996;Zavadskas, Peldschus, &amp; Kaklauskas, 1994;Brauers, 2004;Figueira, Greco, &amp; Ehrgott, 2005;Triantaphyllou, 2010;Zopounidis &amp; Pardalos, 2010;Köksalan, Wallenius, &amp; Zionts, 2011;Behzadian, Kazemzadeh, Albadvi, and Aghdasi (2010); Govindan and Jepsen (2016).

        <p>Many studies have employed MCDM tools to solve problems in engineering, science, technology, economics, and other fields (Mardani et al., 2015). But the presence of so many MCDM approaches bewilders users, resulting in the difficulty of selecting one appropriate method (Saaty &amp; Ergu, 2015). Zavadskas and Turskis (2011) reviewed numerous applications of MCDM methods in economics, and Liou and Tzeng (2012) published a response to the previous publication. That 2012 publication was followed by a paper reviewing Tzeng's contributions (Liou, 2013). A special issue on MCDM for engineering was published (Wiecek, Matthiasehrgott, Fadel, &amp; Ruifigueira, 2008). Applications in a separate area of civil engineering as building and construction were presented (Jato-Espino, Castillo-Lopez, Rodriguez-Hernandez, &amp; Canteras-Jordana, 2014;Zavadskas, Liias, &amp; Turskis, 2008). Reviews devoted to decision-making in related areas as infrastructure management (Kabir, Sadiq, &amp; Tesfamariam, 2014), asset management (Gay &amp; Sinha, 2013), E-learning (Zare et al., 2016) were published. Zavadskas, Turskis, and Kildienė (2014) summarised reviews (review papers and books) on a topic of MCDM. Systematically classified information on methods and applications, covering 2000-2014 and involving nearly 400 papers grouped in 15 fields, can be observed in the recent review (Mardani et al., 2015a). It is worth mentioning that energy, environment, and sustainability were ranked as the areas that have the most frequently applied diverse decision-making techniques and approaches, based on multiple criteria assessment (Mardani et al., 2015).Many studies have employed MCDM tools to solve problems in engineering, science, technology, economics, and other fields (Mardani et al., 2015).

        <p>Sustainability is a natural subject of MCDM, because, by itself, it includes three sub-sets of criteria: economics, environmental, and social aspects (Antucheviciene, Kala, Marzouk, &amp; Vaidogas, 2015). When analysing sustainable industries, a fourth sub-set of criteriainvolving engineering and technological dimensions -is also important. A review of methodologies applied for assessing and selecting technological alternatives from a sustainability perspective was presented by Ibáñez-Forés, Bovea, and Pérez-Belis (2014). The assessment process involves several stages of choosing criteria, ranking or weighting them, followed by comparing and selecting the alternatives. There are a lot of methods which have been created for the different stages of decision-making for sustainable technology selections. According to Ibáñez-Forés et al. (2014), criteria can be compared directly without weighting, with equal weighting, or by applying different methods of subjective and objective weighting. Direct ranking, outranking, multi-attribute utility theories, multi-objective programming, elementary aggregation methods, or complex and non-classical aggregation methods can be applied for selecting the best alternative.Sustainability is a natural subject of MCDM, because, by itself, it includes three sub-sets of criteria: economics, environmental, and social aspects (Antucheviciene, Kala, Marzouk, &amp; Vaidogas, 2015).

        <p>One of the more innovative themes in sustainable production is related to using materials of low embodied energy, renewable resources, and energy efficient applications. An overview of applications of MCDM approaches for sustainable and renewable energy problems was produced (Mardani, Jusoh, Zavadskas, Cavallaro, &amp; Khalifah, 2015). The overview classifies the approaches into two categories: classical MCDM and non-classical, i.e., fuzzy methods (FMCDM).One of the more innovative themes in sustainable production is related to using materials of low embodied energy, renewable resources, and energy efficient applications.

        <p>According to Govindan et al. (2015), many of the latest approaches integrate fuzzy logic. The extended methods based on fuzzy logic receive more and more attention. 2015 marked the 50th anniversary of the introduction of the Fuzzy Sets Theory by Zadeh (1965), and special anniversary journal issues were published (Herrera-Viedma, 2015;Yager, 2015). Mardani et al. (2015) published a comprehensive review on extended MCDM, namely on developments and numerous applications of FMCDM. The review of Antucheviciene et al. (2015) examines applications of decision-making methods for dealing with uncertainties in engineering problems applying extended methods by means of fuzzy logic and probabilistic modelling. Non-classical approaches, called complex (Ibáñez-Forés et al., 2014), or integrated (Govindan et al., 2015;Ho, Xu, &amp; Dey, 2010), or hybrid (Shyur &amp; Shih, 2006;Tzeng, Chiang, &amp; Li, 2007) have not been reviewed completely so far. Accordingly, the current paper aims at filling the gap and summarising publications related to developments and especially to applications of hybrid MCDM (HMCDM) methods, including those for supporting overall sustainability and for promoting their usage in modern decision-making. Because HMCDM approaches represent a relatively new and progressive trend, their abilities to join different techniques can assist decision-makers in handling miscellaneous information, involving stakeholders' preferences, interconnected or contradicting criteria, and uncertain environments.According to Govindan et al.

        <p>The literature related to HMCDM models, abbreviated as HMCDM, has been reviewed comprehensively on the basis of papers referred in Thomson Reuters Web of Science academic database. Mesghouni et al. (1999) can be considered the first reference to a hybrid approach in decision-making, because it examined the coupling of three approaches, given as a hybrid approach, to solve a scheduling problem: genetic algorithms (GAs), constraint logic programming (CLP), and MCDM (Mesghouni et al., 1999). The term 'HMCDM' was firstly applied by Shyur and Shih (2006) for the use of the MCDM approach, which incorporated the technique of an analytic network process (ANP) and the technique for order performance by similarity to idea solution (TOPSIS). Tzeng et al. (2007) presented a novel HMCDM model based on factor analysis and DEMATEL. Tzeng authored and co-authored many papers that popularised the term 'Hybrid MCDM' in the scientific community. The acronym 'HMCDM, ' as used in the current paper, was presented by Liao, Wu, Huang, Kao, and Lee (2014) for the first time. The acronym as a keyword is presented in a paper co-authored by Tzeng (Pourahmad et al., 2015). Note, however, that the acronym 'HMCDM' is applied less frequently than the phrase 'Hybrid MCDM' to identify the analysed methods in publications. Consequently, 'Hybrid MCDM' is applied as the main keyword in the current research.The literature related to HMCDM models, abbreviated as HMCDM, has been reviewed comprehensively on the basis of papers referred in Thomson Reuters Web of Science academic database.

        <p>HMCDM involves four groups of decision-making methods or their combinations with other methods. Figure 1 depicts how the MCDM methods may be combined with methods to calculate the relative significance of criteria, as well as fuzzy sets or grey numbers.HMCDM involves four groups of decision-making methods or their combinations with other methods.

        <p>Several shortcomings of usual classical MCDM methods can be solved by using the proposed variety of hybrid methods as follows:Several shortcomings of usual classical MCDM methods can be solved by using the proposed variety of hybrid methods as follows:</p>
        <p>(1) Selecting an appropriate method is a continuous challenge in every situation that requires a decision. Different MCDM methods sometimes yield different rankings of alternatives. No one method can be considered best either for a general or for a particular problem (Saaty &amp; Ergu, 2015). Accordingly, it is recommended to use more than one MCDM method and to integrate results for final decision-making. (2) Ranking order and the final decision can vary significantly depending on the importance of each criterion in the analysed problem. There are studies available without weighting when the same importance is assigned to all criteria considered (Ibáñez-Forés et al., 2014). The hybrid approach suggests solving two tasks simultaneously, such as determining criteria weights and values and integrating them to the multi attribute utility function value. Moreover, integrating criteria weights, determined by using different objective and subjective weighting methods, helps to reflect stakeholders' preferences more carefully.(1) Selecting an appropriate method is a continuous challenge in every situation that requires a decision.

        <p>Fuzziness in the decision-making process often stems from a context of managerial uncertainty, when ambiguities and difficulties make reaching a proper decision difficult. Accordingly, integrating MCDM with fuzzy sets or grey numbers is preferred. Fuzzy logic could help to overcome uncertainties that arise from human qualitative judgements and incomplete preference relationships (Govindan et al., 2015). (4) Some other techniques can also be employed to add more justification in the problem formulation. Because of sustainability assessments' lack of overall acknowledged metrics (Ingwersen et al., 2014), quantitative and qualitative methods can be applied for generalising information, selecting sustainability assessment indicators, and deriving evaluation criteria for further multiple criteria analysis.Fuzziness in the decision-making process often stems from a context of managerial uncertainty, when ambiguities and difficulties make reaching a proper decision difficult.

        <p>What are the reasons Taiwan emerges as the leader in the number of publications authored? Taiwan's dominant ranking is primarily due to the work of the famous Taiwanese scientist, Gwo-Hshiung Tzeng, who is the author of early publications on HMCDM methods. He popularised the analytic approach in the scientific community; he authored and co-authored a lot of papers, and his works are highly cited. His paper presenting a novel HMCDM model based on factor analysis and DEMATEL (Tzeng et al., 2007) was cited 243 times which placed it in the top 1% of the most highly cited works in the academic field of engineering. Forty-seven of his papers on a subject of HMCDM are refereed in the WoS database, and those publications represent 42% of all Taiwanese papers on the subject. Tzeng's scientific school inspired other scientists to use his methods in their own research, and these methods eventually spread to other countries due to international scientific collaboration.What are the reasons Taiwan emerges as the leader in the number of publications authored?

        <p>When developing HMCDM methods, modular MCDM or extended MCDM methods have been used (Figure 7), and the most frequently used methods are ANP, DEMATEL TOPSIS, AHP, and VIKOR. Of the top five most commonly cited methods, VIKOR receives 57 applications (48 in articles) and ANP, the highest, receives 110 in all documents (93 in articles). After the mentioned well-known methods, two newly developed approaches follow: COPRAS (with 14 citations, 13 in articles) and SWARA (10 citations, nine in articles). The other methods were used in developments fewer than 10 times. It is observed that the methods have been applied in 32 areas, but the majority of research is found in seven areas, including Computer Science (117), Engineering (107), Operational Research &amp; Management Science (73), Business Economics (40), Mathematics (24), Energy Fuels (13), and Environmental Sciences Ecology (10).

        <p>A comprehensive review of literature on supplier selection with the help of diverse MCDM methods was presented in a review paper in 2013 (Chai, Liu, &amp; Ngai, 2013). Meanwhile, in 2014-2015 there were many new developments and applications in the area of green manufacturing and supply chains. The five most frequently used techniques in HMCDM (ANP, DEMATEL, AHP, TOPSIS, and VIKOR demonstrated in Figure 7) are also the most frequently applied for supply problems in sustainable environments. Green manufacturing practices can be explored and the best one selected with the assistance of a HMCDM model combining DEMATEL based on ANP (DANP) with PROMETHEE (Govindan, Kannan, &amp; Shankar, 2015). Because uncertainty is involved, the use of fuzzy numbers with MCDM methods VIKOR or DEMATEL is suggested for evaluation of green supply management practices (Rostamzadeh, Govindan, Esmaeili, &amp; Sabaghi, 2015;Tsui, Tzeng, &amp; Wen, 2015). The responsibility of identifying common drivers of green manufacturing is investigated by applying fuzzy AHP (Govindan, Diabat, &amp; Madan Shankar, 2015). Evaluating alternative green suppliers and the selection of the best one demands the development of criteria and the application of optimisation models (Kannan, Govindan, &amp; Rajendran, 2015). As for energy issues, a hybrid model for evaluating suppliers with regard to carbon and energy management performance is presented with an example of a hotel company. Performance criteria are identified using the FDM, and next, the DANP is applied to weight the criteria. Finally, VIKOR is used to evaluate the suppliers (Hsu, Kuo, Shyu, &amp; Chen, 2014). The green supplier selection in the construction of a thermal power plant is addressed by applying a hybrid fuzzy Entropy -TOPSIS approach (Zhao &amp; Guo, 2014). The next important issue dealing with sustainable production and consumption is summarised in Table 4. HMCDM methods are successfully applied for technologies development and selection as well as for product development and selection. In the recent review, energy, environment, and sustainability were ranked as the areas that have most frequently applied MCDM approaches (Mardani et al., 2015). Regarding HMCDM applications, energy issues are also analysed frequently. The benefits of renewable energy in terms of environmental protection and economic viability are evaluated by applying a combination of Entropy and fuzzy GRA (Zhao &amp; Guo, 2015). The prioritisation of renewable energy sources and technologies and the analysis of benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR) in combination with ANP is provided (Kabak &amp; Dağdeviren, 2014b). After deciding on the best renewable energy source, assessment of a region's priority for implementation of projects can be made with the help of HMCDM (Vafaeipour, Hashemkhani Zolfani, Morshed Varzandeh, Derakhti, &amp; Keshavarz Eshkalag, 2014). Further, an assessment of building energy performance involving a number of criteria is important (Kabak, Köse, Kırılmaz, &amp; Burmaoğlu, 2014) for further designing effective energy systems by combining multi-objective optimisation and MCDM (Perera, Attalage, Perera, &amp; Dassanayake, 2013). Numerous applications of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems and fuzzy MCDM methods in problems related to renewable energy systems are summarised (Suganthi, Iniyan, &amp; Samuel, 2015). A review of off-grid electricity supply technologies and methodologies for making sustainable energy sourcing decisions is also presented (Bhattacharyya, 2012). As for the increased awareness concerning environmental protection in waste treatment, evaluating health care waste treatment technologies by applying DEMATEL, MULTIMOORA and fuzzy sets is provided (Liu, You, Lu, &amp; Chen, 2015a), and selecting the best plastic recycling technology by combining AHP and TOPSIS methods is suggested (Vinodh, Prasanna, &amp; Hari Prakash, 2014).A comprehensive review of literature on supplier selection with the help of diverse MCDM methods was presented in a review paper in 2013 (Chai, Liu, &amp; Ngai, 2013).

        <p>After prioritising renewable energy sources and technologies, the suitability of a site for project implementation should be evaluated considering multiple, usually conflicting criteria (Table 5). Moreover, the data for assessment of location performance of the construction site involve subjective attributes and weights of the attributes which are usually expressed in linguistic terms. This makes fuzzy logic a more natural approach to these kinds of problems (Önut, Kara, &amp; Efendigil, 2008). For these reasons, fuzzy ANP, fuzzy DEMATEL and fuzzy ELECTRE methods for offshore wind farm site selection are applied (Fetanat &amp; Khorasaninejad, 2015). A hybrid method involving DEMATEL and DANP for improving solar farms site selection is used (Chen, Huang, &amp; Tsuei, 2014). Greenhouse locating is analysed from the aspects of physical conditions and natural environment, regional economy, and social environment. ANP is applied to find the relative significance of the identified criteria with an emphasis on interdependent relationships; the COPRAS-G method is applied to rank the regions and to select the best location for a greenhouse (Rezaeiniya, Zolfani, &amp; Zavadskas, 2012). Focusing on the social context, the location of such services as recreation is important. Selection of the best leisure space in an urban site is made by using a powerful tool, i.e., a combination of HMCDM models, involving fuzzy AHP and DANP, and geographical information systems (GIS) (Pourahmad et al., 2015).After prioritising renewable energy sources and technologies, the suitability of a site for project implementation should be evaluated considering multiple, usually conflicting criteria (Table 5).

        <p>A number of papers employing HMCDM are aimed at company management, including both internal and external environment evaluations. The current papers consider economic viability without compromising sustainability issues; social and environmental responsibility are commonly discussed topics. As can be seen from Table 6, the most frequently applied MCDM methods in the following hybrid extensions are ANP and DEMATEL, which serve both crisp and fuzzy environments. The mentioned methods are applied in various industries: for risk analysis in the foundry industry due to its hot environment (Ilangkumaran, Karthikeyan, Ramachandran, Boopathiraja, &amp; Kirubakaran, 2015) or risk analysis in Public Private Partnership projects (Valipour et al., 2015) for corporate social responsibility implementation in the mining industry (Govindan, Kannan, &amp; Shankar, 2014), and for performance evaluation of hotels (Chen, Hsu, &amp; Tzeng, 2011). The methods are suggested to be applied for ranking alternatives of corporate actions with a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders (Wang, Yang, &amp; Lin, 2015). Human and environmental aspects are considered in developing and evaluating strategies in tourism (Chuang, Lin, Chen, &amp; Chen, 2013;Liu, Tzeng, &amp; Lee, 2012), and in recreational sports (Chen &amp; Sun, 2012). Managing a company's environmental knowledge is a complex uncertain process and requires a number of qualitative and quantitative measurements. A hybrid approach is proposed involving fuzzy sets to describe the subjective linguistic evaluations, including ANP to evaluate interdependence among the criteria and DEMATEL to fix the relations (Tseng, 2011a,b).A number of papers employing HMCDM are aimed at company management, including both internal and external environment evaluations.

        <p>MCDM methods can be useful to support evaluation and selection processes and to help improve the overall sustainability of industries and organisations. Because sustainability is a natural subject of multiple criteria analysis, it is often classified into three sub-sets of criteria, involving economics, environmental, and social aspects. During the last few years, combining two or more methods to solve the same multiple criteria problem (HMCDM) has been used increasingly to support decision-making. A decision-maker or a group of decision-makers can be more confident in the results when HMCDM is applied, especially in cases of increasing variety and complexity of information as well as when facing more challenging problems. The current research discusses the advantages of hybrid approaches over individual methods, establishes general trends and main domains of application, and promotes the future use of HMCDM to address sustainability issues.MCDM methods can be useful to support evaluation and selection processes and to help improve the overall sustainability of industries and organisations.

        <p>Considering distribution of application of HMCDM based on publication years, it is observed that application increases every year by a growing percentage. Eighty-four per cent of articles in the area have been published during the last five years, and articles of the last two years account for 50%, respectively. Accordingly, we can presume the increasing interest in current methods in the near future. .Considering distribution of application of HMCDM based on publication years, it is observed that application increases every year by a growing percentage.

        <p>Considering the distribution of research by country of origin, it is interesting to note that some countries display a disproportionate application of HMCDM approaches. However, a deeper analysis reveals that particular scientific schools and highly referenced international collaborations explain the dominance of particular countries. While HMCDM methods have been applied by researchers affiliated in 34 countries, we find the greatest number of applications of MCDM (455) and of HMCDM (103) from Taiwan. The next most commonly represented countries are Iran (with 38 publications on HMCDM), Turkey (26), China (25),and Lithuania (22).Considering the distribution of research by country of origin, it is interesting to note that some countries display a disproportionate application of HMCDM approaches.

        <p>Attempting to determine which MCDM methods have been used the most frequently in developing hybrid approaches, we find that the most popular are the well-known methods that feature strong mathematical backgrounds and valuable characteristics, namely AHP, ANP, and DEMATEL (separately or as DANP), TOPSIS, and VIKOR. Each of the methods was applied from 57 up to 110 times in all documents as well as from 48 up to 93 times in articles. The other methods were applied much less frequently.Attempting to determine which MCDM methods have been used the most frequently in developing hybrid approaches, we find that the most popular are the well-known methods that feature strong mathematical backgrounds and valuable characteristics, namely AHP, ANP, and DEMATEL (separately or as DANP), TOPSIS, and VIKOR.

        <p>After prioritising technologies, selecting the suitability of a site for project implementation is evaluated considering economically, environmentally and socially friendly issues in changing and risky environments. This makes a fuzzy logic or grey numbers a more natural approach.

        <p>In summary, because individual MCDM methods can yield different rankings, selecting an appropriate method is a great challenge. It is therefore recommended to use a hybrid approach based on more than one method and to integrate those results for final decision-making. Another advantage of hybrid approaches over individual methods is based on an opportunity of integrating subjective and objective criteria importance into the value of utility function. Simultaneously applying fuzzy logic can help to overcome uncertainties arising from human qualitative judgements, incomplete preference relationships, and to bring a model closer to real-life representation.In summary, because individual MCDM methods can yield different rankings, selecting an appropriate method is a great challenge.

        <p>The findings of the current research confirm that applications of HMCDM approaches for sustainability issues are gaining a higher recognition due to their ability to effectively assist decision-makers in handling miscellaneous and varied information. Due to the increasing variety and complexity of information, it seems that the number of articles on the topic will be fast-growing and also will be used in other domains of sustainability.The findings of the current research confirm that applications of HMCDM approaches for sustainability issues are gaining a higher recognition due to their ability to effectively assist decision-makers in handling miscellaneous and varied information.
