        <p>BACKGROUND Unlike most noninvasive imaging modalities, coronary computed tomography angiography can characterize subtypes of atherosclerotic plaque.</p>
        <p>OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic implications of adverse coronary plaque characteristics in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.</p>
        <p>METHODS In this SCOT-HEART (Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART Trial) post hoc analysis, the presence of adverse plaque (positive remodeling or low attenuation plaque), obstructive disease, and coronary artery calcification within 15 coronary segments was assessed on coronary computed tomography angiography of 1,769 patients who were followed-up for 5 years. RESULTS Among study participants (mean age 58 AE 10 years; 56% male), 608 (34%) patients had 1 or more adverse plaque features. Coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction was 3 times more frequent in patients with adverse plaque (n ¼ 25 of 608 [4.1%] vs. n ¼ 16 of 1,161 [1.4%]; p &lt; 0.001; hazard ratio [HR]: 3.01; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.61 to 5.63; p ¼ 0.001) and was twice as frequent in those with obstructive disease (n ¼ 22 of 452 [4.9%] vs. n ¼ 16 of 671 [2.4%]; p ¼ 0.024; HR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.79; p ¼ 0.036). Patients with both obstructive disease and adverse plaque had the highest event rate, with a 10-fold increase in coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction compared with patients with normal coronary arteries (HR: 11.50; 95% CI: 3.39 to 39.04; p &lt; 0.001). However, these associations were not independent of coronary artery calcium score, a surrogate measure of coronary plaque burden.</p>
        <p>CONCLUSIONS Adverse coronary plaque characteristics and overall calcified plaque burden confer an increased risk of coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. (Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART</p>
        <p>Pathological studies in patients with myocardial infarction have identified an association between plaque rupture and adverse plaque characteristics that includes positive remodeling, a large necrotic core, microcalcification, and a thin fibrous cap (1).</p>
        <p>Correlates of these features have been described for noninvasive imaging with coronary CTA and include the presence of positive remodeling, low attenuation plaque, spotty calcification, and the "napkin ring" sign (2).</p>
        <p>These plaque characteristics are associated with an increased risk of subsequent acute coronary syndromes (2)(3)(4). Recent data have suggested that positive remodeling and low attenuation plaque in particular provide the most useful prognostic information (2,5), although it remains unclear whether this is of incremental value to traditional cardiovascular risk factors or coronary plaque burden.</p>
        <p>In the SCOT-HEART (Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART) prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of patients with stable chest pain, the addition of coronary CTA to routine care led to improved diagnostic certainty and patient care that ultimately reduced the rate of coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (6)(7)(8). These benefits were largely attributable to subsequent changes in patient management and treatment, which had been guided by the presence of obstructive or nonobstructive coronary artery disease as determined by coronary CTA. However, it may be that further risk stratification and targeted intensification of therapy in patients with adverse plaque characteristics could achieve additional benefits that go beyond the presence of obstructive or nonobstructive coronary artery disease.</p>
        <p>In this secondary analysis of the SCOT-HEART trial, we aimed to determine the extent of adverse coronary artery plaque characteristics on coronary CTA and their association with subsequent clinical outcomes. If confirmed, the identification of these coronary artery plaque characteristics may help risk stratification and guide the intensity of therapy.</p>
        <p>STUDY DESIGN. The SCOT-HEART trial was a multicenter randomized controlled trial of coronary CTA in outpatients with suspected angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease (9). The primary results have been reported previously (6)(7)(8). This paper presents a secondary post hoc analysis of the SCOT-HEART study.</p>
        <p>PARTICIPANTS. In brief, 4,146 patients who attended the cardiology outpatient clinic were randomized to standard care alone or standard care plus coronary CTA, and were followed up for symptoms, management, and outcomes. Of the 2,073 participants who were randomized to the intervention arm, 1,778 underwent coronary CTA. Coronary CTA and noncontrast imaging for calcium scoring was performed as described previously (7). Cardiovascular risk was assessed using the ASSIGN (ASsessing cardiovascular risk using Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network guidelines) score. This score has been validated for the Scottish population and, in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, incorporates social deprivation and family history of cardiovascular disease (10).</p>
        <p>Coronary artery calcium score was assessed on noncontrast computed tomography (CT) using the Agatston scoring method as previously described (11).</p>
        <p>Coronary artery calcium scores were classified into 4 categories (0, 1 to 99, 100 to 399, and $400 Agatston units [AU]).</p>
        <p>On coronary CTA images, per-segment assessment of atherosclerotic plaque was performed using a For each segment, the presence or absence of 4 coronary artery plaque characteristics was assessed (Figure 1): positive remodeling, low attenuation plaque, spotty calcification, and the "napkin ring" sign.</p>
        <p>Positive remodeling was defined as an outer vessel diameter that was 10% greater than the mean of the diameter of the segments immediately proximal and distal to the plaque (3). Low-attenuation plaque was defined as a focal central area of plaque with an attenuation density of &lt;30 Hounsfield Units (14).</p>
        <p>Spotty calcification was defined as focal calcification within the coronary artery wall &lt;3 mm in maximum diameter (3). The "napkin ring" sign was defined, as previously described, as a central area of lowattenuation plaque that had a peripheral rim of high attenuation (15). Observer agreement for the assessment of coronary artery plaque characteristics has overall been shown to be fair (16). were statistically significant on univariable analysis.</p>
        <p>The assumption of proportional hazards was checked using 
            <rs type="software">SPSS</rs>. A statistically significant difference was defined as a 2-sided p value &lt;0.05.
        </p>
        <p>Of the 1,778 individuals who underwent a coronary CTA, 1,769 participants had images that were available and of suitable quality for analysis (Online Figure 1).</p>
        <p>Patients had a mean age of 58 AE 10 years, and 56% were male with a range of cardiovascular risk factors and symptoms (Table 1). Of these patients, 37% 2, Online Tables 1 to 4).</p>
        <p>Adverse plaques were present in 608 (34%) patients. Patients with adverse plaques were older, had a higher body mass index, and were more likely to be male. They were also more likely to have a previous history of coronary heart disease or hypertension, to be a smoker, or to have typical angina ( 2). Most events occurred in patients with adverse plaques in the proximal segments rather than the mid and distal segments (n ¼ 23 of 489 [4.7%] vs. n ¼ 2 of 119 [1.7%]; p ¼ 0.197). Adverse plaque features appeared to have a greater prognostic value in women and those under the age of 60 years, with a body mass index &gt;30 kg/m 2 or with a lower cardiovascular risk score, but these differences were not statistically significant (Online Table 6). The presence of 1 or more segments of spotty calcification or the napkin ring sign was not associated with a difference in coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction on perpatient assessment (Online Tables 3 and7).</p>
        <p>In a large, multicenter, prospective study of coronary CTA, we demonstrated that adverse coronary plaque characteristics are associated with a tripling of the risk of coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. The presence of obstructive disease was also a major predictor of risk, with the combination of adverse plaque with obstructive disease appearing to confer the greatest risk (Central Illustration). At 5 years, the risk of coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction was similar in patients with obstructive disease without adverse plaque and nonobstructive disease with or without adverse plaque. However, overall, the only independent predictor of risk was the coronary artery calcium score, a surrogate measure of overall plaque burden. These results suggest that although plaque composition and its hemodynamic consequences are associated with future myocardial infarction, the predominant factor governing patient outcomes is the burden of coronary atherosclerosis.</p>
        <p>Adverse coronary plaque is associated with subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease (2,4,5,17). In keeping with previous work (2,3,(17)(18)(19), we found that the plaque characteristics that were the most helpful in predicting future coronary events were positive remodeling and low-attenuation plaque. These CT characteristics are markers of pathological vulnerability (20) Acute myocardial infarction occurs when there is rupture or erosion of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque and there is associated thrombus formation causing vessel occlusion (22). The presence of pre-existing flow limitation due to obstructive atheroma is not a prerequisite for this process. Indeed, it should be remembered that the majority (w80%) of myocardial infarctions are attributable to nonobstructive coronary plaques on antecedent angiography (23). Moreover, the risk of future myocardial infarction is similar whether the coronary plaque causes 50% to 85% or &gt;85% luminal stenosis (24). A nested case-control study of patients without known coronary artery disease within the CONFIRM (Coronary CT Angiography Evaluation for Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicentre) registry identified that &gt;65% of patients who developed acute coronary syndromes had nonobstructive disease on their baseline coronary CTA (25). This reflects the important nature of the biology of the atherosclerotic plaque rather than the functional consequence of luminal stenosis (26). For the prediction of subsequent coronary events, the presence of atherosclerotic plaque is more important than the presence of coronary stenoses. Indeed, in our study, patients with a combination of both obstructive coronary artery disease and adverse plaque had the worst outcomes. Moreover, patients with nonobstructive disease and adverse plaque had similar outcomes to patients with obstructive disease without adverse plaque. Thus, our study provides evidence that coronary artery disease should no longer be defined based on luminal severity, but instead by the volume and type of disease.</p>
        <p>When examined across the cohort as a whole, adverse plaques did not provide independent prognostic information when CT calcium scoring was included. CT calcium scoring is a surrogate marker of plaque burden, and its prognostic utility has been established in large studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (27,28). It is likely that patients with higher plaque burden are more likely to have adverse plaques and are more likely to have severe coronary artery stenoses. Few studies have assessed the clinical implications of this overlap. A small study of 339 patients with suspected coronary artery disease found that both adverse plaques and CT calcium score were independent predictors of cardiac events at 2 years (29). Clearly, the greater the burden of disease, the greater the risk of events.</p>
        <p>However, for the individual patient, the assessment of coronary artery calcium alone is not sufficient to guide management, as the presence and volume of coronary artery calcification is not directly related to the degree of coronary artery stenosis and cannot inform on the pathophysiological status of the atherosclerotic plaque (30). Indeed, in the PROMISE study, coronary CTA provided better prognostic discrimination compared to coronary artery calcium score (31). Intriguingly, we also observed that adverse plaque was particularly discriminatory in patients with a low calcium score, reaffirming the concept that calcification is a healing or protective response to coronary atherosclerosis and that large areas of calcification are associated with plaque stabilization.</p>
        <p>It is perhaps not surprising that the identification of plaque characteristics at a single time point by coronary CTA may not be sufficient to predict future events in long-term follow-up. Atherosclerotic plaque undergoes continuous remodeling driven by a variety of genetic and environmental factors, and we know that medications, such as statins, alter the constituents of atherosclerotic plaque (32). Autopsy studies show that atherosclerosis is present in young people (33) and nomograms for CT calcium score (28) and plaque burden (34) Second, the SCOT-HEART study was not designed or powered for this secondary analysis, and our findings are exploratory. Third, we used a simple and pragmatic approach to the identification of adverse plaques that would not greatly add to the time spent analyzing CT scans. Automated software that can identify plaque characteristics may further improve observer variability in the classification of adverse plaques and help standardization. Finally, the trial did encourage the use of secondary preventative therapies in patients found to have either obstructive or nonobstructive disease. This will have inevitably reduced the number of events as well as reduced our ability to identify associations between plaque characteristics and clinical events because they will have been modified by the initiation of antiplatelet and statin therapies.</p>
        <p>We have demonstrated that adverse plaque characteristics provide prognostic information out to 5 years, but that this is not independent of plaque burden assessed by coronary artery calcium score.</p>
        <p>Patients with obstructive disease and adverse plaques have the highest event rates throughout follow-up.</p>
        <p>This may aid the identification of a subgroup of patients who would benefit from more intensive medical therapy. Coronary Artery Plaque Characteristics J A N U A R Y 2 9 , 2 0 1 9 : 2 9 1 -3 0 1</p>
