        <p>In organic photovoltaics, morphological control of donor and acceptor domains on the nanoscale is key for efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation, carrier transport, and suppression of recombination losses. To realise this, here, we demonstrated a double-fibril network based on ternary donor:acceptor morphology with multi-length scales constructed by combining ancillary conjugated polymer crystallizers and non-fullerene acceptor filament assembly. Using this approach, we achieved an average power conversion efficiency of 19.3% (certified 19.2%). The success lies in the good match between the photoelectric parameters and the morphological characteristic lengths, which utilizes the excitons and free charges efficiently. This strategy leads to enhanced exciton diffusion length (hence exciton dissociation yield) and reduced recombination rate, hence minimizing photon-to-electron losses in the ternary devices as compared to their binary counterparts. The double-fibril network morphology strategy minimizes losses and maximizes the power output, offering the possibility towards 20% power conversion efficiencies in single-junction organic photovoltaics.In organic photovoltaics, morphological control of donor and acceptor domains on the nanoscale is key for efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation, carrier transport, and suppression of recombination losses.

        <p>Organic semiconductors offer the advantage of high optical absorption and tunable energy levels, enabling thin-film solar cells with high light-to-electron conversion efficiencies over a wide range of wavelengths [1][2][3][4] . Desipte recent progresses, the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) is still limited by non-ideal exciton and charge transport, which depend not only on the electronic structure of organic semiconductors but also on the nanostructure that is formed by material crystallization and phase separation in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) setting [5][6][7][8] . A suitable sized phase-separated morphology that balances crystalline region and mixing domain on the nanoscale is therefore needed to further push the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs, however it is a Submitted Manuscript: Confidential 3 nontrivial endeavor since the thin-film deposition is a non-equilibrium process that depends on multiple factors including the chemical structures and processing conditions 9 .Organic semiconductors offer the advantage of high optical absorption and tunable energy levels, enabling thin-film solar cells with high light-to-electron conversion efficiencies over a wide range of wavelengths [1][2][3][4] .

        <p>A useful strategy to manipulate thin-film morphology is the introduction of a third component which can selectively interact with donor or acceptor to induce extra morphology control handles 6,[10][11][12][13][14][15] . And by using enthalpy dictated crystallization, a crystallization induced phase-separated morphology with suitable size scale can be achieved 16,17 , creating an intertwined donor (D)-acceptor (A) bicontinuous network with domains on the tens of nanometers scale, such that efficient exciton and carrier transport can be achieved. Meanwhile, the size of the mixing domain needs to be refined to enhance the carrier diffusion before on board the crystalline transport phase, which dictates the efficiency of carrier transport at conditions close to open circuit, hence influencing the fill factor (FF) of the device.A useful strategy to manipulate thin-film morphology is the introduction of a third component which can selectively interact with donor or acceptor to induce extra morphology control handles 6,[10][11][12][13][14][15] .

        <p>In this work, a bicontinuous double-fibril network morphology (DFNM) is demonstrated using a carefully designed ternary mixture, in which the phase separation, crystallinity, and specific fibril widths are collectively manipulated. The resulting nanostructure matches well with the requirements for efficient exciton and free charge transport with ~40 nm exciton diffusion length, ~105 nm free charge diffusion length, and ~2700 nm free charge drift length (estimated at short circuit condition) 18,19 . The matured crystallization of polymer donor and non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) fibrils in the blended thin film leads to a reduced mixing zone and suppressed recombination. An extraordinary FF of ~82% is recorded and a breakthrough in average PCE of 19.3% with a maximum value of 19.6% is obtained in the optimized single-junction OSCs.In this work, a bicontinuous double-fibril network morphology (DFNM) is demonstrated using a carefully designed ternary mixture, in which the phase separation, crystallinity, and specific fibril widths are collectively manipulated.

        <p>The highly crystalline polymer D18 is used as the seeding agent for the moderate crystalline polymer PM6 in order to retain the advantageous PM6:L8-BO morphology framework while enhancing the crystallinity of the blend 20,26 . An optimum amount of D18 added into PM6:L8-BO raises Jsc and FF simultaneously (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 1), Meanwhile, the glass-encapsulated devices exhibited ~95% of the initial PCE after 2520 hours of storage in the glove box at 25 ℃. More importantly, the ternary device showed better illumination stability than that of binary devices, indicating that the introduction of D18 can better balance the photochemical and morphology stability of the blend system (shown in Supplementary Fig. 6). The external/internal quantum efficiency (EQE/IQE) results show an increase in EQE of the ternary device due to more efficient exciton diffusion, which contributes to improved Jsc and PCE (see Fig. 1e, Supplementary Figs. 5b,c and7, and Supplementary Note 1 for details.) The statistics of solar cell devices were shown in Fig. 1f and a jump in PCE value is recorded in the ternary mixture.The highly crystalline polymer D18 is used as the seeding agent for the moderate crystalline polymer PM6 in order to retain the advantageous PM6:L8-BO morphology framework while enhancing the crystallinity of the blend 20,26 .

        <p>To understand the origin of the encouraging device performance, we investigated the film microstructure. As shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 8), a fibrillar network structure is seen in all blended films. The fibril texture in primitive PM6:L8-BO blends is roughly defined with a smaller fibril diameter and more sparse fibril distribution. D18 is a strongly crystalline polymer and of slightly low solubility than PM6, which precipitate out in an earlier film growth stage and induce crystallization. Adding D18 into PM6 helps to improve the crystallinity of the blends by forming a high-quality fibril network with increased fibril diameter and distribution, as evidenced by atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterizations (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). The Fourier transformation yields an inter-fibril distance ~25 nm, a suitable length scale of phase separation to balance exciton splitting and carrier transport. With this phase image, we then looked into the detailed phase construction of the blended thin-films. Photo-induced force microscope (PiFM) was employed that uses localized near field infrared imaging to identify the chemistry associated with thin-film morphology (see Fig. 2b, Supplementary Figs. 11 and12, and Supplementary Note 2 for details). The corresponding PiFM phase images of PM6:D18:L8-BO blends were shown in Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 12a. Interestingly, both PM6 and L8-BO formed fibril network structures in the blend. The overlay of the two images (Supplementary Fig. 12b) yields an entangled DFNM with donor and acceptor domain in close contact. Such observation provides a good understanding of the OSCs' morphology, indicating that crystallization-induced morphology can result in better phase connectivity and finer sizes.To understand the origin of the encouraging device performance, we investigated the film microstructure.

In blended films, both conjugated polymers and NFA are preferentially face-on oriented according to π-π stacking peak locations, which facilitate carrier transport. The overlapping of lamellar and π-π stacking peaks were used to evaluate the structure order of the thin film (shown in Supplementary Fig. 14 and Supplementary Table 2). The D18:L8-BO film exhibits high crystallinity and large crystal size, where the PM6:L8-BO film shows weak crystallinity and small crystal size, and the PM6:D18:L8-BO film lies in-between and is close to PM6:L8-BO film.

The small amount of D18 in ternary blend promotes the crystallization of both donor polymer and NFA molecules. We ascribe such effect to the heterogeneous nucleation seeding mechanism 28,29 , which helps to increase the fibril content and crystallite quality in a blended thin-film.13d,e and 15 and Supplementary Table 3).

        <p>To further support experimental results, we here perform quantitative device modelling, using a coupled exciton diffusion, optical transfer matrix, and drift diffusion model based on gpvdm [40][41][42] . Specifically, the effects of exciton diffusion efficiency and free charge recombination rate constant on IQE/EQE and FF are modelled (see Supplementary Figs. 303132, Supplementary Tables 1213, and Supplementary Note 10 for details). By modelling exciton diffusion within a single, spherical, acceptor domain whose size is determined by the phase separation length, and using exciton diffusion lengths from Supplementary Table 12, we demonstrate that exciton collection is more efficient from the ternary and PM6:L8-BO structures (~97%) than from the lowest performing D18:L8-BO structure (~94%). Further simulations based on optical and electrical models also demonstrated the highest IQE/EQE, Jsc, and FF in the ternary blends (see Supplementary Fig. 32), which is a collective effect by the efficient exciton diffusion and suppressed recombination, further supporting the claim that enhanced exciton dissociation yield and reduced free charge recombination are important reasons for the performance enhancement in the ternary device.To further support experimental results, we here perform quantitative device modelling, using a coupled exciton diffusion, optical transfer matrix, and drift diffusion model based on gpvdm [40][41][42] .

        <p>While the conjugated polymer shows a high tendency to form crystalline fibrils, the NFA molecule crystallization behavior is a curious property to investigate. Conventional NFAs that rely on π-π stacking to form ordered structures have a high tendency to form 2D brick wall packing or 3D network packing 43,44 . The Y6 molecules with a banana geometry show a different packing motif whereby they align their molecular long axes to form a polymer-like structure and extend along the body center diagonal in the lattice plane 45 . The L8-BO with a long branched side-chain gives slightly stronger alkyl chain interactions and adopts a more condensed packing with the long axis along the face center half diagonal, forming smaller domains between conjugated backbones in crystals. A careful examination of the single crystal yields more interesting information in which multiple dimer packing motifs are seen (Fig. 4a-c) and 8 monomer packing is needed to form a complete period. More importantly, several linear molecular assemblies intertwined together to form a strong assembly with a high aspect ratio (Fig. 4b,c) that can be of high tolerance to local structure defects. These properties make L8-BO forming needle-type single crystals (Fig. 4d). In the TEM diffraction investigation, it is confirmed that the molecular long axis is aligned with needle packing length (Fig. 4e).

        <p>DFNM enables efficient exciton and free charge transport in the blended thin films studied herein. To confirm that, we try to correlate the fundamental photophysical properties of donor and acceptor materials in the blend with the structural features. A large group of acceptor materials was studied to look into the detailed photophysical property change versus material nature. The representative exciton decay kinetics as a function of excitation density of L8-BO is shown in Supplementary Fig. 33, from which the exciton diffusion length can be estimated. As the fibril diameter and should guarantee a highly efficient exciton splitting. The exciton diffusion in the donor phase is also investigated as complementary to acceptors (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Figs. 36-39, and Supplementary Table 14). The conventionally used donor materials such as PM6, PM7, and PTQ10 show an exciton diffusion length around 14 nm, which is much lower compared to that in the high-efficiency Y6 acceptor family. Thus, enhancing the exciton diffusion of polymer donors can be a viable approach in improving photo harvesting. We noticed that several high crystalline donor polymers have higher exciton diffusion lengths compared to the above-mentioned donor polymers, and thus designed the binary donor polymer blends to improve exciton diffusion. Adding a secondary, high crystalline donor (20 wt.%) such as D18 could improve the exciton diffusion length to around 20 nm, which better matches the polymer fibril's diameter and catches up with that in NFAs. We believe this property could result in better photo management in devices, leading to high Jsc and FF.DFNM enables efficient exciton and free charge transport in the blended thin films studied herein.

We noticed that several high crystalline donor polymers have higher exciton diffusion lengths compared to the above-mentioned donor polymers, and thus designed the binary donor polymer blends to improve exciton diffusion. Adding a secondary, high crystalline donor (20 wt.%) such as D18 could improve the exciton diffusion length to around 20 nm, which better matches the polymer fibril's diameter and catches up with that in NFAs. We believe this property could result in better photo management in devices, leading to high Jsc and FF.</p>

        <p>41-43, and Supplementary Tables 15-17, conventional ITIC analogs using the ternary blends do not help to improve device performance, and obvious FF drop is recorded in several blends. We ascribe these results to unoptimized NFA morphology in which domain connection is an issue (no similar fibril network channels are formed). In the Y6-based NFA blended system, the ternary blends with improved exciton diffusion length and donor-acceptor crystallinity do help to improve the Jsc and FF, resulting in higher PCEs. In addition, we ran experiments on more blending ratios and different material systems to monitor the device performances and characteristics (see Supplementary Figs. 44-49, Supplementary Tables 18192021, and Supplementary Note 11 for details). The results show that an appropriate reduction of the mixing zone size can increase exciton utilization. The high-quality double fibril transport channel ensures the efficient diffusion of carriers and is no longer a shortboard that restricts the performance of the device.41-43, and Supplementary Tables 15-17, conventional ITIC analogs using the ternary blends do not help to improve device performance, and obvious FF drop is recorded in several blends.

        <p>From the above-discussed observations, the successful demonstration of adding D18 into the PM6:L8-BO blends provides a showcase of average efficiency of 19.3% (certified 19.2%), associated with very high Jsc and FF. The device performance improvement was achieved by DFNM. Such a morphological scheme requires both high-quality D-A crystallites to form a multi-length scaled dual fibril network, facilitating exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport.From the above-discussed observations, the successful demonstration of adding D18 into the PM6:L8-BO blends provides a showcase of average efficiency of 19.3% (certified 19.2%), associated with very high Jsc and FF.

        <p>This morphology also reduces the mixing zone content and feature size, from which exciton splitting and carrier generation are more efficient. Meanwhile, the observation of NFA fibril-type network crystallization is encouraging, which provides insights for the next generation material design. Moreover, the synergetic combination of D18 and PM6 adds up the morphological and photophysical advantages of the donor phase network to allow balanced exciton/free charge transport and recombination, contributing to the improvement of Jsc and FF.

        <p>Supplementary Fig. 17d). From the NK-NEXAFS of the nitrogen-containing material D18 and L8-BO, the absorption of the blend film at 400 eV is only from L8-BO (Supplementary Fig. S16b). Therefore, the phase separation scales of L8-BO in the three blend films are 68.8 nm (D18:L8-BO), 49.0 nm (PM6:L8-BO), and 51.8 nm (PM6:D18:L8-BO), respectively, which is consistent with the result of 285.2 eV in CK-RSoXS. Thus, D18 could induce a better-defined fibril structure in ternary blends by improving the fibril diameter, as demonstrated by AFM and PiFM characterization. It is noted that the inter-fibril distance is only slightly larger than the diameter of the fibril, thus the mixing region in-between the fibrils is small (summarized in Supplementary Table 4). Therefore, the charges in the mixing zone could effectively diffuse to Submitted Manuscript: Confidential 8 the fibril network and be collected by electrodes. Scattering anisotropy is seen in RSoXS (Supplementary Fig. 17), which is parallel with a polarized electrical field at 285.2 eV. Thus, the L8-BO fibril/mixing zone interface is "edge-on" oriented 35,36 . A schematic illustration of this DFNM is shown in Fig. 2e.
