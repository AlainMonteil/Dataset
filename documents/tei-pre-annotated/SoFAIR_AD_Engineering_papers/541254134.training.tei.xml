        <p>Laser synthesis emerges as a suitable technique to produce ligand-free nanoparticles, alloys and functionalized nanomaterials for catalysis, imaging, biomedicine, energy and environmental applications. In the last decade, laser ablation and nanoparticle generation in liquids has proven to be a unique and efficient technique to generate, excite, fragment and conjugate a large variety of nanostructures in a scalable and clean way. In this work, we give an overview on the fundamentals of pulsed laser synthesis of nanocolloids and new information about its scalability towards selected applications. Biomedicine, catalysis and sensing are the application areas mainly discussed in this review, highlighting advantages of laser-synthesized nanoparticles for these types of applications and, once partially resolved, the limitations to the technique for large-scale applications.Laser synthesis emerges as a suitable technique to produce ligand-free nanoparticles, alloys and functionalized nanomaterials for catalysis, imaging, biomedicine, energy and environmental applications.

        <p>The intrinsic properties of nanoparticles (NPs), possibly combined with other materials, disclose many applications where one can achieve miniaturization (e.g., of electronic equipment), weight reduction (as a result of an increased material efficiency) and/or improved functionalities of materials (e.g., higher durability, conductivity, thermal stability, solubility, reduced friction, selective molecular detection) [1,2]. The remarkable size-tunable properties of nanomaterials produced by laser-matter interaction (e.g., size distribution, agglomeration state/dispersion, crystal structure, surface area and porosity, surface charge, shape/morphology, dissolution/solubility) make them a hot research topic in material science, with far-reaching applications, ranging from quantum computers to cures for cancer [3,4].The intrinsic properties of nanoparticles (NPs), possibly combined with other materials, disclose many applications where one can achieve miniaturization (e.g., of electronic equipment), weight reduction (as a result of an increased material efficiency) and/or improved functionalities of materials (e.g., higher durability, conductivity, thermal stability, solubility, reduced friction, selective molecular detection) [1,2].

        <p>Bottom-up and top-down procedures are the two approaches used for the synthesis of nanomaterials [5]. The first include the miniaturization of materials and components (up to the atomic level) with subsequent self-assembling that leads to the formation of nanostructures. Typical examples are the formation of quantum dots during epitaxial growth, or the production of NPs as colloidal dispersions by chemical approaches [6]. Instead, top-down approaches use macroscopic starting structures that are externally controlled by the processing down to nanostructures. Typical examples are etching (controlled by masks), ball milling, metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy and the application of severe plastic deformations [7].Bottom-up and top-down procedures are the two approaches used for the synthesis of nanomaterials [5].

        <p>There are many literature papers on laser interaction with hard, soft and smart materials, targeting future applications in the fields of energy production (nano-energy) and biomedicine [8], as well as recent progress in the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in laser processing [9]. Such laser techniques are interesting in many regards, as they enable the processing of photovoltaic cells [10], thermoelectric materials and devices [11], micro and nanosystems for energy storage and conversion [12,13], biodegradable and biocompatible NPs for food packaging [14] as well as vectors for drug and gene delivery [15,16]. The interest towards pure and electrostatically stabilized nanocolloids is well recognized [17][18][19][20][21]. Although nanotechnologies and nanomaterials have much potential to introduce innovative products and production processes in the food industry and in the biomedical field, they are facing major challenges in being cost-effective in the production of e.g., edible and nontoxic nano-delivery systems, or effective formulations that are safe for human consumption and drug treatments [22].There are many literature papers on laser interaction with hard, soft and smart materials, targeting future applications in the fields of energy production (nano-energy) and biomedicine [8], as well as recent progress in the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in laser processing [9].

        <p>The generation of NPs with LAL still has some challenging aspects, such as the fabrication of NPs with a specific size and shape, the reduction of polydispersity and the increase of productivity [39]. Despite some unsolved problems of a physical, chemical and technical nature, several strategies have been proposed to overcome the above issues, including the selection of the appropriate liquid or stabilizing agent, the optimization of the focusing conditions and liquid levels, as well as the adoption of scanning and fluid dynamics strategies by different liquid handling configurations [40][41][42][43][44] and the postirradiation of colloids [45].The generation of NPs with LAL still has some challenging aspects, such as the fabrication of NPs with a specific size and shape, the reduction of polydispersity and the increase of productivity [39].

        <p>To explore the wide range of opportunities that LAL brings, the unique properties of femtosecond lasers is a further hot research topic, not only to increase NP production, but also to generate structural modifications and new material phases [46,47]. As reported by Streubel et al. [48], low productivity shortcomings in LAL have been almost entirely remedied, reaching NP production rates of several grams per hour. In addition to LAL, Laser Melting in Liquids (LML), Laser Fragmentation in Liquids (LFL) as well as pulsed Laser Photoreduction/oxidation in Liquids (LPL), offer alternative routes to obtain colloids with controlled NP sizes. Nevertheless, an industrial series product, or manufacturing process based on laser-synthesized particles is yet to come. Together with the development of new strategies to increase NP productivity, future efforts should be directed to further improve the surface properties of the produced NPs, since each application requires a different surface/interface chemistry. This would ensure reaching an advanced stage in those applications where the surface processes determine the performance of the final devices [49].To explore the wide range of opportunities that LAL brings, the unique properties of femtosecond lasers is a further hot research topic, not only to increase NP production, but also to generate structural modifications and new material phases [46,47].

In Figure 2 the different LAL steps are summarized. Laser-matter interaction: The basic mechanisms inducing the laser ablation in liquid, as well as their dependence on laser pulse properties, do not differ notably, with respect of laser ablation in gaseous environment [54]. In the case of ns-laser ablation, just a portion of the laser pulse reaches directly the target surface, while most of the laser pulse is spent in electron heating by inverse bremsstrahlung. This implies that the ablated material is converted to a plasma phase during the laser pulse irradiation. Differently to what can be observed in a gas background environment, as a consequence of the water incompressibility, the ablated material is strongly confined and in turn reaches high density. This effect decreases the penetration of the laser through the plasma during the initial stage of expansion, inducing the propagation of gradient of temperature in the ejected material, i.e the plasma. For what concerns the type of target used, it should be considered that morphological, electrical and optical properties of the target affect the initial interaction of the material with the laser pulse. For example, a metallic target allows the use of lower ablation irradiance with respect to the semiconductor, if we neglect the difference in reflectivity. In any case if an irradiance well above the breakdown threshold is used, the ablation can be assumed congruent, and similar plasma behavior can be observed.As it has been clearly established, ns-PLAL is based on a sequence of different processes: laser ablation and plasma induction, energy exchange from plasma to the liquid and consequent generation of the cavitation bubble and release of particles from the bubble to the solution.

        <p>The mechanisms concerning the evolution of the ejected material after laser ablation are strongly correlated to the duration of the laser pulse. Ideally, with a laser pulse with a shorter duration than a few tens of fs, the effect of the interaction of the laser pulse with the ejected material can be neglected and the evolution of the ablated material can be investigated with atomistic models [56]. On the contrary, when the laser pulse is long enough (as in the case of ns) to effectively interact with the ablated material, inducing further ionization and electron heating, the role of the plasma becomes dominant and kinetics models coupled with fluidynamics are required for a full description of the phenomenon [57]. In this review, when describing fundamental aspects, we will refer to ns-ablation, while a brief discussion on ultrashort ablation is reported in Section 2.2.The mechanisms concerning the evolution of the ejected material after laser ablation are strongly correlated to the duration of the laser pulse.

        <p>Plasma phase: The plasma phase plays an important role during ns-LAL because the plasma is the source of material that allows the formation of NPs. Plasma phase during ns-LAL can be investigated with Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) in order to estimate the plasma parameters such as electron number density, N e , atomic number density, N a , and excitation temperature, T, as well as the features of plasma dynamics after laser ablation. The emission spectrum of the Laser Induced Plasma (LIP) under water is characterized mainly by continuum radiation with possibly some resonance peaks of the element constituting the target [40]. The absence of the typical atomic spectral lines of the LIP expanding in a gaseous environment is due to the high density reached by the ablated matter under liquid confinement as discussed in [40][41][42]. In this case, the emission spectrum has a Planck-like shape that has been ascribed to the radiative recombination and that in turn is proportional to the blackbody law, although the spectrum is not related to any blackbody system. To better understand this crucial point, let us consider blackbody (BB) power density in the Wiens' approximation at hν/kT &gt;&gt; 1, which is valid for the range 400-500 nm and T ~6000 K:Plasma phase: The plasma phase plays an important role during ns-LAL because the plasma is the source of material that allows the formation of NPs.

        <p>As an example, Figure 3 shows the temperature map of a plasma induced on an aluminum target immersed in water. By the inspection of the figure it can be observed that in the core of the plasma, where the number density is very high [60,61], there is a decrease in temperature beyond the condensation temperature of most of the metals. As a matter of fact, the high pressure of the plasma at this condition, i.e., under water confinement, allows for condensation at higher temperatures than those in standard condition. This observation indicates that NPs can be formed in the bulk of the plasma and not only in the border of the plasma where the plasma cools down fast as a consequence of the rapid exchange of energy between the plasma and the surrounding liquid. It may be assumed that also the material on the plasma border condensates in particle, but being this zone of the plasma out of equilibrium, it produces particles with various sizes and shapes. On the contrary, particles formed in the bulk of the plasma, being the result of thermodynamic equilibrium between the processes of growth and the evaporation, are characterized by a spherical shape with narrow size distribution.As an example, Figure 3 shows the temperature map of a plasma induced on an aluminum target immersed in water.

        <p>The cavitation bubble: The fast transfer of energy from the plasma to the surrounding water induces the formation of a thin layer of vapor around the plasma border with high temperature and high pressure. In order to reach the equilibrium with the liquid, the vapor expands, producing a cavitation bubble. In the upper part of Figure 4, an example of the temporal evolution of a laser-induced bubble during silver ablation is reported. The bubble expands until it reaches the equilibrium with the surrounding liquid. Due to the fast expansion, the liquid at the border of the cavitation is compressed and when the pressure of the bubble reaches the minimum at the maximum of the expansion, the bubble is compressed and its shrinking stage begins. During this stage, the bubble increases its pressure again and impacts the target, eventually pushing back the material to the target surface. There are several models describing the evolution of a laser-induced bubble [64,65]. Most of these descriptions are based on a theoretical model simulating the bubble radius evolution, assuming the mass and momentum conservation equations in the liquid phase, and that the vapor pressure inside the bubble is balanced by the pressure on the liquid side of bubble wall [66]. As an example, neglecting the evaporation/condensation effects as the time associated to bubble dynamics is shorter than that of these processes, the Keller-Miksis formulation can be applied with the following equations [66]:The cavitation bubble: The fast transfer of energy from the plasma to the surrounding water induces the formation of a thin layer of vapor around the plasma border with high temperature and high pressure.

All studies agree independently from the ablated matter, the chosen liquid and the used laser pulse duration on a higher productivity by using IR laser light compared to UV or Vis. The laser fluence was kept at identical or at least comparable values in all studies. However, LAL was applied as a batch approach in all investigations, and NP-induced shielding due to Rayleigh scattering [71] most likely caused the differences in productivity. In addition, a higher absorption cross-section is given for NPs of nearly all metals at UV or Vis wavelengths compared to IR wavelengths [72]. This is strongly indicated by the observed smaller NP diameters at shorter applied wavelengths [54,69,70], which may be the result of fragmentation induced by subsequent laser pulses during batch-LAL.Laser Wavelength: The laser wavelength essentially influences the ablation rate in LAL [54,[67][68][69][70].

The ablation rate increased stronger for most metals when switching from the Vis to the UV range then from the IR to the Vis range, which was in good agreement with the interband absorption of the targets. Similar results were also found by Stafe et al. [74]. Naturally, the individual light absorption properties of bulk materials should influence the number of absorbed photons of different wavelengths and provide optimums for high ablation rates. However, the optical properties of an irradiated surface significantly depend on its temperature [75], roughness [76,77] and oxidation state/degree [78]. For example, Letzel et al. [79] recently observed a significant increase in the productivity of the laser ablation of silver in water during the first 250 laser pulses irradiating an initially smooth target surface. Temperature, roughness and oxidation state/degree of the target surface change differently strong during LAL and depend strongly on the ablated material. This limits the a priori choice of the most productive wavelength for LAL according to the standard light absorption spectrum of the material to be ablated.Semerok et al.

        <p>It may be concluded that higher ablation rates for metals generally occur at UV laser wavelengths due to the interband absorption. However, the productivity at Vis and IR wavelengths can be comparable. A strong dependence on the metal, the laser fluence and also the laser pulse duration exists. In case of high colloidal concentrations, the higher absorbance of short wavelengths by the particles can make LAL of metals at short wavelengths less productive. These relations are summarized in Figure 6. Note that for semiconducting and dielectric materials the initial ablation rate in absence of a light-extinction colloid can be higher at red and near IR wavelengths under specific conditions due to differences in the ablation mechanism compared to metals [80,81].It may be concluded that higher ablation rates for metals generally occur at UV laser wavelengths due to the interband absorption.

Different results by both procedures can occur due to variations of the beam propagation within the liquid phase. Furthermore, the distribution of the laser energy density in the spot of a Gaussian beam differs.

        <p>Riabinina et al. [90] investigated the NP productivity of the LAL of gold in an aqueous sodium citrate solution at different pulse durations between 40 fs and 200 ps but a constant fluence of 50 mJ/cm 2 . An optimal productivity was found at a pulse duration of 2 ps. The authors expected a decrease in the productivity at lower pulse durations to be caused by the optical breakdown of the liquid. A loss of productivity at higher pulse durations was expected to originate from heat losses in the target and laser-induced shielding effects. During their experiments, the laser pulse repetition rate was kept constant and the scanning speed was kept at zero, which makes shielding effects at longer pulse durations realistic. Interestingly, Sakka et al. [100] also observed a decreasing ablation rate at an increasing pulse duration during the nanosecond-pulsed laser ablation of copper in water, although this effect did not occur during laser ablation in air. This finding confirms the origin of a negative impact of an increasing pulse duration on the ablation rate in the presence of the liquid environment. In another study, Dittrich et al. compared the absolute and power-specific productivity of LAL of gold in water for a compact, a middle class and a high-end laser system [101]. The authors applied LAL in a liquid flow and with sufficient laser scanning to limit shielding effects. They found that even though the absolute productivity was the lowest for the low-power, compact laser system, power-specific productivity was much higher compared to the other systems. All three laser systems differed in the laser pulse duration, which was 1 ns for the compact, 5 ns for the middle-class and 3 ps for the high-end laser system, respectively.Riabinina et al.

        <p>Further details on the effect of the pulse duration on the ablation rate can be derived from studies on the laser ablation of metals in air and vacuum. Schille et al. [102] found a slight decrease in the ablation rate of copper during an increase of the pulse duration from 200 fs to 4 ps. A further increase of the pulse duration up to 10 ps significantly reduced the ablation rate. As demonstrated by Jaeggi et al. [103], the threshold fluence for ablation increases and the penetration depth decreases in the ablation of copper and steel in air when increasing the pulse duration from 10 ps to 50 ps. Naturally, both effects negatively affect the ablation rate. If the pulse duration is further increased from the picosecond to the few nanosecond time regime, the threshold fluence for ablation becomes constant [104]. In addition, the ablation rate becomes independent from the optical penetration depths at these longer pulse durations due to the more thermal ablation mechanism [94]. Minor changes in the ablation rate can be assumed in the transition regime from picosecond to nanosecond pulse durations. However, the thermal nature of the laser ablation intensifies at even longer pulse durations. Heat losses get more dominant and the ablation rate is consequently reduced [105]. In addition, the lifetime of the laser-induced plasma and the pulse duration act on a comparable time scale for laser pulses longer than some ten or hundred nanoseconds, which intensifies a self-induced plasma shielding of single laser pulses.Further details on the effect of the pulse duration on the ablation rate can be derived from studies on the laser ablation of metals in air and vacuum.

        <p>In conclusion, an optimum in the pulse duration for achieving a maximized ablation rate in LAL exists. It is probably located in the order of single picoseconds [86]. As the productivity limitation at lower pulse durations stems from the optical breakdown of the liquid, the optimum of the pulse duration strongly depends on the laser intensity, wavelength and the liquid. Figure 8 illustrates the thermal loss and the pulse self-shielding by its induced plasma in dependence on the pulse duration regime. Furthermore, the dependence of the productivity on the pulse duration is shown qualitatively by excluding the optical breakdown of the liquid. The optical breakdown finds consideration in the following section on the laser intensity.

The optical breakdown of the liquid environment, which may significantly reduce the ablation rate, is usually related to the laser intensity. Additionally, self-focusing of the laser beam may be induced by the optical Kerr effect and consequently increase the laser intensity. This may promote filamentation of the laser beam or an optical breakdown of the liquid. However, the intensity thresholds needed for the optical breakdown of water and the filament formation are comparable for femtosecond-pulsed laser radiation [106]. For picosecond pulses, the intensity threshold for filamentation is generally much higher than for the optical breakdown of water and becomes comparable only at low focusing angles [107].

        <p>The intensity threshold for the optical breakdown of the liquid environment further depends on the chemical nature and the purity of the liquid. In the case of linear hydrocarbons, Fujii et al. [110] found a decrease in the breakdown threshold for an increasing chain length or molecular weight using IR, nanosecond pulses. This is probably due to the increasing absorption cross-section of the hydrocarbons. The threshold intensities for the optical breakdown of different hydrocarbon aromatics at IR, nanosecond pulses are in the order of 10 12 W/cm 2 [111]. Kovalchuk et al.

In addition, the presence of soluble species also significantly reduces the intensity threshold of a liquid for its breakdown [113,114].

        <p>In conclusion, the optical breakdown of the liquid environment in absence of an ablation target must be excluded for the applied laser parameters in LAL. Thereby it needs to be considered that colloidal particles and dissolved species reduce the breakdown threshold.

The strategy is to spatially separate successive laser pulses by adjusting the interplay of the laser spot size, the scanning speed (relative movement between laser beam and target) and the pulse repetition rate to avoid shielding caused by the previous pulse [82,84,90,91,116].Sattari et al.

        <p>A flowing liquid homogenizes the result of LAL compared to a static fluid environment [102,103]. As demonstrated by Streubel et al. [48], the productivity of LAL can be optimized by varying the flow velocity of the liquid. However, a dilution of the colloid must be accepted in parallel if LAL is applied continuously. The increase in productivity is probably caused by a faster transport of shielding species away from the ablation zone and an overall reduction of the concentration of shielding species. Consequently, the improvement of the productivity must saturate at a specific flow rate.A flowing liquid homogenizes the result of LAL compared to a static fluid environment [102,103].

        <p>Interestingly, the height of the liquid layer on top of the ablation target also has an impact on the productivity. Al-Mamun et al. [86] observed a maximized ablation rate at a minimized layer height of 2 mm and Jiang et al. [122] found an optimum height at 1.2 mm. Both research groups assumed a confinement effect as a reason for a generally higher productivity at lower liquid layer heights. For example, shock waves generated in the ablation process could be reflected back to the target from the liquid-air interface. In addition, the experimental implementation must also be considered. Especially for long ablation times and batch setups, the exponential absorption of the laser radiation by the nanoparticle colloid, described by the Beer-Lambert law, will be much stronger at high liquid levels. Menéndez-Manjón et al. [44] further pointed out the importance of the compensation of the change in beam propagation induced by the refraction at the air-liquid interface, when changing the liquid layer height. The authors also describe the productivity-limiting effect of explosive vaporization of the liquid at a critical minimum of the liquid layer height. This effect may have led to the optimum liquid layer height observed by Jiang et al.

        <p>The impact of the physicochemical nature of the liquid on the productivity in LAL is more complex. Baladi and Mamoory [121] investigated the ablation rate in the nanosecond-pulsed, IR laser ablation of aluminum in ethanol, acetone and EG (ethylene glycol) at comparable laser fluences. They found similar ablation rates for ethanol and acetone. However, the ablation rate during LAL in EG was lowered by more than 90%. Cristoforetti et al. [87] observed comparable productivities in the nanosecond-pulsed, IR laser ablation of palladium in ethanol and 2-propanol, but a productivity reduction in acetone (by 15%), water (by 20%) and toluene and n-hexane (by 85%). The reasons for those differences in productivity remained unclear.The impact of the physicochemical nature of the liquid on the productivity in LAL is more complex.

        <p>Kalus et al. [120] also observed significantly different ablation rates during LAL (nanosecond-pulsed, IR) in water compared to mono-, di-and tri-EG. The authors could correlate the reduced productivity to intensified shielding of the laser beam by persistent bubbles. They found that the size and dwell time of the bubbles depends on the viscosity of the liquid. Consequently, a higher viscosity promotes shielding and reduces the ablation rate. However, the low-viscous liquid ethyl acetate did not fit the observed trend. There must be at least one other factor such as the vapor pressure or the specific heat of vaporization considered to make the shielding by persistent bubbles more predictive.Kalus et al.

        <p>Another study on the productivity of LAL in different liquids was conducted by ablating iron using IR, femtosecond laser pulses. Interestingly, the authors observed an optimum in the energy-related productivity for all tested liquids (water, methanol, ethanol, acetone and toluene) at a similar fluence but with different ablation rates. Again, the lowest ablation rate was observed in toluene, 85% lower than in water. The low applied repetition rate of 1 Hz combined with a low liquid layer of 4 mm should have minimized shielding effects by persistent bubbles. In addition, no significant difference was found in the ablation-effective spot diameter and the amount of reflected laser energy. However, the plasma radiation in different liquids qualitatively mirrored the productivity. The question for the productivity-lowering liquid parameter remained unanswered, but differences in the laser penetration depth into the ablation target, as assumed by the authors, were unlikely to take place at the short pulse duration of 35 fs.Another study on the productivity of LAL in different liquids was conducted by ablating iron using IR, femtosecond laser pulses.

        <p>In summary, the productivity of LAL can be improved by applying a liquid flow, by choosing a low liquid level, and by performing LAL in water. In specific cases, water undesirably alters the properties of the NPs, for instance, by oxidation. Low-viscous organic solvents like ethanol or acetone represent the best alternatives in such a case. Figure 11 Target Geometry: There are three dimensions to vary on the geometry of a bulk ablation target. By reducing single dimensions of a bulk to sizes comparable to the laser spot, the available target geometries include foils, wires, and particles.

Nanosecond, IR laser pulses with a fluence of 4.3 J/cm 2 were used. Additionally, debris of gold were present in colloids synthesized from foils with thicknesses between 100 nm and 0.1 mm, which led to an overestimated ablation rate.Scaramuzza et al.

        <p>In conclusion, a higher productivity of LAL can be accessed when ablating macroscopic metal targets compared to thin foils. However, by laser ablating a wire, the highest productivity in nanosecond-pulsed metal ablation should be achievable due to heat confinement. An optimal wire diameter exists, probably in dependence on the laser parameters. Heat confinement in the ablation target plays a minor role in ultrashort-pulsed laser ablation of metals, making wire ablation probably less advantageous here. Figure 12 illustrates the described effects of this section. Critical View on Possibilities of Productivity Improvement: Obviously, the amount of productivity-effective process parameters and variables in LAL is extensive and hard to cover due to the variety and the existing cross-dependencies between the parameters and variables. In addition, the relevant literature does not provide the data required for a productivity evaluation in a full-range parameter variation, not even for a single laser system. Furthermore, important studies like that of Riabinina et al.

        <p>Polyoxometalate (POM) materials, consisting of at least two (usually three or more) transition metal oxyanions that are linked together by shared oxygen atoms to form a large, closed three-dimensional framework, were successfully synthesized by ECLAL. POM nanostructures are attractive because of their high catalytic activity in oil refining, their favorable emission properties and suitability for energy storage applications [130]. With respect to many other synthesis techniques, ECLAL advantages are: (i) clean preparation of nanostructures because of its simple starting materials and limited byproduct formation; (ii) an ambient environment without extreme temperature and pressure conditions; (iii) flexibility to design various nanostructures by combining specific solid targets, electrodes and liquids. Liu et al. [131] first prepared POMs by a one-step route using molybdenum as a solid target, copper as electrodes, and deionized water as the solvent. Two copper electrodes were placed between the two facing sides of a chamber. A steady electric field with a voltage of 20 V was produced by a DC power source. The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized nanostructure indicated that it was a monoclinic phase of crystalline lindgrenite (Cu 3 (OH) 2 (MoO 4 ) 2 ). No signatures of amorphous molybdenum, copper compound or any other oxide phase were found in the XRD pattern, indicating that the synthesized sample is highly pure and crystalline. It emerges that different products should be obtained combining targets and electrodes of different nature. So, Liang and co-workers used three different kinds of combinations, vanadium (target) + copper (electrode) [132], vanadium (target) + silver (electrode) [133] and molybdenum (target) + zinc (electrode) [6], to synthesize ZnMoO 4 microand nanoplates and rods, Cu 3 (OH) 2 V 2 O 7 •2H 2 O flower-like nanostructures, and Ag 2 V 4 O 11 brush-like nanostructures.

        <p>For instance, Ismail et al. [134] reported the production of Bi 2 O 3 NPs by the pulsed laser ablation in water under the effect of the electric field (EFLAL). They found that applying the electric field during laser ablation led to the increase of the Bi 2 O 3 particle size. Sapkota et al. [135] used an excimer laser (351 nm) to ablate a solid tin target immersed in water in the presence of an external electric field, while Jumaa et al. [136] reported the synthesis of gold NPs by the pulsed Nd:YAG (1064 nm) laser ablation in deionized water mainly to study the effect of the electric field on the antibacterial activity of these particles. Al-Haddad et al. [137] synthesized Au NPs by pulsed laser (Nd:YAG, λ = 1064 nm), ablation of a gold target immersed in deionized water by 300 mJ of laser energy, while a DC electrical field was applied above the target with adjusted voltage. The influence of the applied electric field on the formation of platinum NPs by laser (Nd:YAG, λ = 1064 nm) ablation technique was investigated by Moniri et al. [138]. Furthermore, laser ablation of germanium in liquids with static, externally applied electric fields is discussed in [139]. The authors found that ablation in water results in spherical NPs and filaments while ablation in ethanol favors the synthesis of spherical and spindle-shaped NPs. The latter resulted from ablation only with an electric field strength of 9.5 V/cm, and the target being immersed in ethanol. A clear correlation between decreasing spherical particle size and increasing externally applied electric field was found. Similarly, Liu et al. [127], adopting EFLAL, with the second harmonic of a nanosecond-pulsed, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser-prepared GeO 2 micro and nanocubes with high-index facets and a kind of GeO 2 micro and nanospindles. This approach avoids the substantial quantities of capping agents that are attached to the surface of the GeO 2 nanostructures, as observed on germanium oxide nanomaterials prepared by sol-gel reaction. The synthesis of GeO 2 nanocubes and nanospindles is ascribed to the interaction between the laser beam and the external electric field. In the process, first the Ge plasma is expected to form because of the high temperature and pressure induced by laser. Meanwhile, the active O and/or OH species that originate from the decomposition of water would surround the plasma and react with it to form GeO 2 NPs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the products revealed that the preferred {1011} plane of GeO 2 was dominant. This suggests that the applied electric field helped to stabilize the growth of {1011} planes, while hindering the growth of planes perpendicular to such planes. In this case, the six {1011} planes readily formed into the nanocube morphology. As the applied electric field became stronger, the growth of the {1011} plane would be elongated along the [1] direction, which results in the formation of spindle-like morphology. Thus, the electric field plays an important role in governing NP shape.For instance, Ismail et al. [134] reported the production of Bi 2 O 3 NPs by the pulsed laser ablation in water under the effect of the electric field (EFLAL). They found that applying the electric field during laser ablation led to the increase of the Bi 2 O 3 particle size. Sapkota et al. [135] used an excimer laser (351 nm) to ablate a solid tin target immersed in water in the presence of an external electric field, while Jumaa et al. [136] reported the synthesis of gold NPs by the pulsed Nd:YAG (1064 nm) laser ablation in deionized water mainly to study the effect of the electric field on the antibacterial activity of these particles. Al-Haddad et al. [137] synthesized Au NPs by pulsed laser (Nd:YAG, λ = 1064 nm), ablation of a gold target immersed in deionized water by 300 mJ of laser energy, while a DC electrical field was applied above the target with adjusted voltage. The influence of the applied electric field on the formation of platinum NPs by laser (Nd:YAG, λ = 1064 nm) ablation technique was investigated by Moniri et al. [138]. Furthermore, laser ablation of germanium in liquids with static, externally applied electric fields is discussed in [139]. The authors found that ablation in water results in spherical NPs and filaments while ablation in ethanol favors the synthesis of spherical and spindle-shaped NPs. The latter resulted from ablation only with an electric field strength of 9.5 V/cm, and the target being immersed in ethanol. A clear correlation between decreasing spherical particle size and increasing externally applied electric field was found. Similarly, Liu et al. [127], adopting EFLAL, with the second harmonic of a nanosecond-pulsed, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser-prepared GeO 2 micro and nanocubes with high-index facets and a kind of GeO 2 micro and nanospindles. This approach avoids the substantial quantities of capping agents that are attached to the surface of the GeO 2 nanostructures, as observed on germanium oxide nanomaterials prepared by sol-gel reaction. The synthesis of GeO 2 nanocubes and nanospindles is ascribed to the interaction between the laser beam and the external electric field. In the process, first the Ge plasma is expected to form because of the high temperature and pressure induced by laser. Meanwhile, the active O and/or OH species that originate from the decomposition of water would surround the plasma and react with it to form GeO 2 NPs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the products revealed that the preferred {1011} plane of GeO 2 was dominant.

        <p>On the basis of the above-described evidence, it emerges that EFLAL extends the traditional LAL approach, allowing a better control of the morphology, size, chemical composition and structure of the metal-based nanostructures as well as an increase of the NP concentration. This is explained taking into account that: (1) electric field is believed to transport the charged particles produced in the plasma plume at the electrodes, in a process that resembles electrophoresis; (2) EF allows an efficient removal of the bubbles formed both in the volume of the liquid and on the target. The delivery of laser pulses onto the target is more effective and so the ablation rate in liquid is higher by a factor of three (generally, about 300 mg/30 min) compared to ablation without EF (about 100 mg/30 min).On the basis of the above-described evidence, it emerges that EFLAL extends the traditional LAL approach, allowing a better control of the morphology, size, chemical composition and structure of the metal-based nanostructures as well as an increase of the NP concentration.

A molybdenum target was ablated in water and the effect of an external EF (the estimated electric field is 20 V/cm, the Pt electrode distance fixed at 5 cm) applied during the ablation process, has been exploited in order to check for modifications of the NP surface morphology and surface chemical bonding configurations. The obtained colloids were sprayed by means of an ultrasonic atomizer on glass substrates to carry out the chemical-physical characterizations (see Figure 13). A selective tuning of Mo-O chemical bonding configurations and a suitable control of NP size distributions were achieved by varying the water temperature and by applying the external EF. Two types of nanocolloids were prepared: one with a spherical shape, size less than 50 nm and a dominant MoO 2 surface chemical configuration, and another with an oblong structure, where the oxygen deficient MoO 3 phase increases at the expense of the MoO 2 one. Both nanocolloids induce metal redox and antioxidant properties which strongly depend on the Mo-O surface chemical bonding configurations and NP morphology.The EF role on Mo-based nanostructures is also shown by Spadaro and Fazio et al.

        <p>Owing to the unique combination of physical and chemical properties, such as large absorption and scattering cross-section, high sensitivity to local dielectric environment and enhanced electric field at the surface, plasmonic nanostructures are emerging as an important class of materials for various optical sensing applications. Plasmonic systems in particular have been studied extensively due to their ability to confine light below the diffraction limit, which greatly enhances their sensitivity compared to conventional approaches [144]. The oscillating electric field of an electromagnetic wave causes the formation of dipoles and multipoles in metallic NPs. Such multipoles depend on the size and shape of the NP in a way predictable by solving the Maxwell equations at the interface between the metal and the external medium. For noble metals, the plasmonic response of the NP falls into the UV-vis-NIR frequency range and it is significantly observed by considering the absorption and scattering cross sections. In a classical transmittance experiment the overall extinction effect (the sum of scattering and absorption) can be measured. If we restrict our consideration to a spherical NP with a size much smaller so that the impinging radiation wavelength scattering can be neglected (quasi static approximation) and a simple dipole is sufficient to account for the plasmonic behavior:Owing to the unique combination of physical and chemical properties, such as large absorption and scattering cross-section, high sensitivity to local dielectric environment and enhanced electric field at the surface, plasmonic nanostructures are emerging as an important class of materials for various optical sensing applications.

        <p>where α is the electric polarizability and E is the electric field. In this case the polarizability is expressed as:where α is the electric polarizability and E is the electric field. In this case the polarizability is expressed as:</p>
        <p>where ε is the dielectric function [ε 1 (ω) + iε 2 (ω)] and R the radius of the NP. The resonance condition is achieved for maximum polarizability, which happens for ε = -2ε m . It is thus clear that plasmon resonance depends on the metal through its size and dielectric function and on the medium through its dielectric constant ε m (and thus the refractive index n). Much more complex is the situation in all those cases where the NP has a shape far from spherical-like and proper simulations about the plasmonic response should be conducted to interpret the response [142,144,145]. Laser ablation of metallic targets permits the formation of noble metal NPs in a range of solvents, including water and alcohols. Among noble metals, gold has been the most intensely studied, followed by silver. Both NPs can be produced as stable suspensions by LAL with diameters in the range 10-30 nm. Being different metals, they have different dielectric functions allowing plasmon resonances in different spectral regions. Indeed, Ag NPs have their typical plasmon resonance just below 400 nm, which instead lies around 510-530 nm for Au NPs. Despite plasmon resonance depending on particle size, a tuning across a broad range of the spectrum is not achievable just by adjusting spherical particle size. One way to overcome the issue is by alloying [145,146]. Figure 14a shows that even Au/Ag colloidal NP alloys can be grown if the ablation is performed using an alloy target in water [147]. Here, we refer to a gold 70% molar concentration with respect to silver, but any result can be obtained by tuning the concentration, thanks to the total miscibility of the two metals. This ensures the possibility to tune the plasmon resonance from that of silver (400 nm) to that of gold (520 nm) continuously, opening the way to a fine plasmonic response. Alternatively, a very similar result can be obtained by pulsed laser irradiation of a previously formed Au/Ag colloidal mixture [147]. While in the former case the plasmon resonance tuning can be achieved only by choosing a different alloy target for every composition, in the latter case, the colloidal mixture can be prepared in any metal ratio from pure metal colloids, which is a clear advantage. Figure 14b reports a range of simulations conducted using a Boundary Element Method (BEM) developed by A. Trügler [148]. In this case a dielectric environment (water) where bodies with homogeneous and isotropic dielectric functions are separated by abrupt interfaces is assumed, thus solving Maxwell equations using the boundary conditions at the particle boundaries. As for the dielectric function of the considered Au/Ag alloy, a weighted average method was used, in which the dielectric function of the alloy is defined as:where ε is the dielectric function [ε 1 (ω) + iε 2 (ω)] and R the radius of the NP.

        <p>The simulation results shown in Figure 14b agree with the experimental results concerning the plasmon resonance position. The smaller width of the simulated extinction spectra is attributed to the difficulty to set an appropriate damping constant. The same BEM method predicts that as an Au NP grows larger, the plasmon resonance slightly red-shifts and broadens. However, in order to be able to tune the plasmon resonance of a metallic NP, playing with the size is not enough to explore a broad range [143,150]. It has to be noted that Equation ( 1) is strictly valid only for spherical particles, while for particles with different shapes, the geometry must be taken into account and a plasmon resonance shift can be expected. Indeed, beside the aforementioned alloying, a shape change is another effective strategy to tune the plasmon resonance.

        <p>As an example, Figure 15a shows how the typical plasmon resonance observed around 400 nm for spherical Ag NPs is red-shifted to around 600 nm as the particles are transformed to flat triangular nanoplates. Spherical NPs were obtained by LAL in water with citrate as capping agent, using a 1064 Nd:YAG-pulsed laser. These show a single plasmon resonance feature at 393 nm, indicating particles in the region of 10 nm, as can also be observed by SEM in Figure 15b. When such particles are irradiated with white light, in association with H 2 O 2 addition, a dramatic spectral change occurs, with the formation of two main features [156]. One feature is red-shifted to ~600 nm and represents the longitudinal in-plane dipole mode [157]. The other important feature, despite its low intensity, is the out-of-plane quadrupole mode, at 335 nm, which is an indication of anisotropy in the structures [157]. Indeed, spherical particles are converted into flat triangular ones, sized around 100 nm and thick about 10-20 nm, as shown by scanning electron microscopy images and atomic force microscopy profiles in Figure 15c,d.As an example, Figure 15a shows how the typical plasmon resonance observed around 400 nm for spherical Ag NPs is red-shifted to around 600 nm as the particles are transformed to flat triangular nanoplates.

        <p>Such transformation is typically achieved using a process named "seed-mediated growth", which involves the chemical synthesis of Ag NPs starting from an Ag + salt and reducing agents as a first step, followed by a further chemical process to transform initial spherical particles, or "seeds", into triangular nanoplates [158][159][160]. However, the use of LAL for the production of the seeds, coupled with light irradiation and H 2 O 2 addition, has the great advantage of being an environment-friendly process that does not involve the use of strong reducing agents or harmful chemicals [156,161,162]. Moreover, LAL is a very versatile tool where virtually any material can be produced in any liquid without any other chemical involved. This allows for a wide freedom in the use of a variety of capping agents which can be chosen depending on the final application or process needs. Indeed, citrate is an excellent example as, within the process described above, it is used as both a capping agent to stabilize the particles in water, as a driver for growth and reshaping and as a mild reducing agent. The above mentioned dependence of the plasmon resonance on the refractive index of the medium can be exploited for optical sensing applications [163], even at a single molecule level [164,165], as it allows the detection of molecules dissolved in the colloidal phase or adsorbed on the surface, as long as they cause a variation of the refractive index of the medium [166,167]. The key property is the variation of the plasmon resonance relative to the refractive index change, or plasmon sensitivity, which can thus be defined as:Such transformation is typically achieved using a process named "seed-mediated growth", which involves the chemical synthesis of Ag NPs starting from an Ag + salt and reducing agents as a first step, followed by a further chemical process to transform initial spherical particles, or "seeds", into triangular nanoplates [158][159][160].

The above mentioned dependence of the plasmon resonance on the refractive index of the medium can be exploited for optical sensing applications [163], even at a single molecule level [164,165], as it allows the detection of molecules dissolved in the colloidal phase or adsorbed on the surface, as long as they cause a variation of the refractive index of the medium [166,167]. The key property is the variation of the plasmon resonance relative to the refractive index change, or plasmon sensitivity, which can thus be defined as: Figure 16a shows an example of plasmon sensitivity measurements for Au and Ag spherical NPs produced by LAL in water. Ag NPs show higher sensitivity (125 nm/RIU) than Au NPs (45 nm/RIU) and are thus more widely investigated for these type of applications. However, when spherical NPs are converted into nanoplates, the plasmon sensitivity shows a roughly threefold increase [161,169], as shown in Figure 16a. Plasmon sensitivity can be further increased if the Ag NP colloid is irradiated with monochromatic light instead of white light [170]. Indeed, irradiating at 730 nm causes the formation of particles with S = 460 nm/RIU [170] (Figure 16b). On the other hand, other irradiation wavelengths yield NPs with lower sensitivity, hence the wavelength of choice appears a key factor in enhancing plasmon sensitivity.where x denotes the Au molar fraction in the Au-Ag alloy [149]. The simulation results shown in Figure 14b agree with the experimental results concerning the plasmon resonance position. The smaller width of the simulated extinction spectra is attributed to the difficulty to set an appropriate damping constant. The same BEM method predicts that as an Au NP grows larger, the plasmon resonance slightly red-shifts and broadens. However, in order to be able to tune the plasmon resonance of a metallic NP, playing with the size is not enough to explore a Such transformation is typically achieved using a process named "seed-mediated growth", which involves the chemical synthesis of Ag NPs starting from an Ag + salt and reducing agents as a first step, followed by a further chemical process to transform initial spherical particles, or "seeds", into triangular nanoplates [158][159][160]. However, the use of LAL for the production of the seeds, coupled with light irradiation and H2O2 addition, has the great advantage of being an environmentfriendly process that does not involve the use of strong reducing agents or harmful chemicals [156,161,162]. Moreover, LAL is a very versatile tool where virtually any material can be produced in any liquid without any other chemical involved. This allows for a wide freedom in the use of a variety of capping agents which can be chosen depending on the final application or process needs.

        <p>Thanks to their chemical stability gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are very frequently used in comparison to other metallic NPs, such as Ag NPs, which cause toxic effects due to ion solubilization. The presence of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) is an interesting property of this type of NPs that can be exploited for many applications. LSPs arise from collective oscillations of the free electrons of metal nanoparticles and show resonances in the visible and near infrared spectral range, depending on shape, dimensions and aggregation of the nanostructures, with very large extinction cross sections if compared to organic dyes [154]. LSP resonances (LSPR) depend also on the particle surrounding (in particular by its refractive index) and sensors can be developed on such a dependence. Moreover, excitation of the LSPR amplifies the incoming electromagnetic field at the NP surface by some orders of magnitudes within a few nm [178]. This amplification made possible the exploitation of Raman spectroscopy in the field of sensing technology with the technique called Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). In this case, for molecules near the surface of plasmonic NPs, one can obtain amplifications of the vibrational Raman spectrum of up to 10 orders of magnitude and even more in favorable conditions [178].Thanks to their chemical stability gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are very frequently used in comparison to other metallic NPs, such as Ag NPs, which cause toxic effects due to ion solubilization.

        <p>NPs synthesized by LAL are of particular interest because of their clean surface, which allows functional molecules to reach easily the NP surface [179,180].

        <p>The identification of antigens expressed by cells allows active targeting of individual cells, which is relevant in the early stage recognition of cancer cells. We developed a methodology for detecting cancer cells based on sub-nanomolar concentration of nanocolloids functionalized with monoclonal antibodies [147,148] or with engineered targeting peptides [172,[180][181][182][183]. SERS labels, namely molecules showing huge SERS signals when coupled to plasmonic NPs, were used on the nanostructures to identify active targeting events using the presence of SERS signals on individual cells incubated with the nanostructures. SERS signals are vibrational signals, which are easily recognized and cannot be confused with other signals, like in the case of fluorescent signals usually exploited for this purpose. Our protocol is efficient because the naked particles, synthesized by laser ablation, are functionalized simply by mixing the colloidal solution of Au NPs with the solutions of the targeting molecules, without the need to control the exchange with stabilizing molecules used in other NP preparations. Molecules and also antibodies are thiolated to assure a strong link with the Au NPs. Strong SERS signals are obtained by controlling the aggregations of NPs, which create the hot spots where molecules show very intense SERS signals.The identification of antigens expressed by cells allows active targeting of individual cells, which is relevant in the early stage recognition of cancer cells.

        <p>The results show the need to engineer the peptides for the NP functionalization. A long polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain (3000 molecular weight) and a short-charged lysine sequence linked to the active peptide are required to obtain high targeting efficiencies that, in particular for specificity, are found to be also better than those obtained with a specific monoclonal antibody already used in clinic. The results suggest that the large number of peptides (thousands per particle) per NP overcome the problem of the small affinity of the single peptide, exploiting the avidity of an ensemble of targeting units on a single nanostructure. With this approach, sensitivity and specificity larger than 80-90% are obtained [171,182] (see Figure 17a). Models for the arrangement of the targeting units on the Au NP surface, obtained with Molecular Dynamics calculations, show that the presence of the short lysine charged sequence is strategic for obtaining the appropriate exposition of the targeting peptide over the PEG chains, collapsed over the NP surface [172,182].The results show the need to engineer the peptides for the NP functionalization.

        <p>SERS signals, as a new approach for the detection of targeting events are much more efficient than the usual fluorescence signals and allow very easy multiplexing measurements because of the very narrow bands that can be recorded for vibrational SERS spectra with respect to the very large bands observed for fluorescence spectra [175]. SERS signals are particularly useful when used for in vivo studies where autofluorescence of tissue and other biological components hamper the detection of low intensity fluorescence signals. This is not the problem of SERS signals in particular when they derive from SERS labels with known spectra. After inoculation of nanostructures with SERS signals into mice, we were able to easily find SERS signals in their organs where nanostructures accumulated, or in a tumor, whose margins can be easily obtained with SERS signals. An example is the targeting of SerpinB3 antigen, expressed by liver tumor cells in a mouse which overexpressed this protein, using nanostructures functionalized with the peptide PreS1. The targeting activity was first evidenced in in vitro studies and, when applied to animal trials, the targeted organs reported bright SERS signals with a complete clearance in 6 h [180]. Another example was obtained with nanostructures constructed as multimodal contrast agents. In particular we obtained a nanostructured system in which a SERS label and an MRI contrast agent based on Gd3+ were present. MRI images of a tumor were obtained for mice injected with the nanostructures together with SERS images, which easily showed the margin of the tumor [182] (see Figure 17b). the Au NP surface, obtained with Molecular Dynamics calculations, show that the presence of the short lysine charged sequence is strategic for obtaining the appropriate exposition of the targeting peptide over the PEG chains, collapsed over the NP surface [172,182].

        <p>Furthermore, we found that a quantitative approach can be obtained in an application like Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) also with drugs spiked in plasma, which simulates a real situation. Plasma is a difficult matrix due to the large concentration of proteins, which interfere with the availability of hot spots of the nanostructures for the SERS spectra. It is worth to recall the protocol used for the TDM in the case of Erlotinib, a therapeutic drug for cancer cells overexpressing EGFR [153]. A SERS measurement requires that the molecule to be revealed shows strong SERS signals, which is usually observed when a resonance of the exciting laser line with the molecular excitations is present, obtaining the so-called surface enhanced resonant Raman scattering (SERRS). Since this is not always possible for the molecules to be revealed, we found that a competitive approach is more efficient. This is the case of the Erlotinib molecule, which absorbs in the UV spectral region, far from the laser excitations in the visible, or near infrared spectral region where the LSPR lie. In this case, a molecule with strong SERRS signals is used, in competition with the molecule to be revealed, for the occupation of the hot spots of the nanostructures. The protocol we used favored the coupling of the molecules with the gold nanostructures with a click reaction for both Erlotinib and the competitor molecule.Furthermore, we found that a quantitative approach can be obtained in an application like Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) also with drugs spiked in plasma, which simulates a real situation.

        <p>Traditionally, nanoplasmonics focuses on noble metals (Au, Ag, Cu) or their alloys whose LSPRs are in the visible (Vis) or near-infrared (NIR) spectral regions [184]. In the ultraviolet (UV) region the considerable damping due to interband transitions [185] make electromagnetic enhancements comparatively small. Nevertheless, UV nanoplasmonics may offer new opportunities in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) [186], photocatalysis [187], biology [188] and public safety and security for the detection of organic molecules and hazardous organic compounds [189]. Such molecules show strong electronic absorption in the UV region, which may trigger the resonant Raman (RR) effect under UV excitation. The RR effect leads to ca. 10 8 -fold enhancement of the Raman cross-section, allowing to detect ultralow molecular concentrations [190].Traditionally, nanoplasmonics focuses on noble metals (Au, Ag, Cu) or their alloys whose LSPRs are in the visible (Vis) or near-infrared (NIR) spectral regions [184]. In the ultraviolet (UV) region the considerable damping due to interband transitions [185] make electromagnetic enhancements comparatively small.

        <p>Theoretical studies predict that metals with a large negative real part and a small imaginary part of the dielectric constant in the UV are suitable candidates for UV-SERS [191]. The most experimentally tested UV-SERS platforms are Al, Ga, In, Pb, Sn, Bi, Rh, Ru, Pt and Pd, owing to their availability and to the absence of interband transitions in the UV [192]. For instance, an ultrasensitive label-free detection of adenine molecules adsorbed on Al nanoparticle arrays using deep-UV SERS (with 257.2 nm excitation) was reported [193]. However, similar to Mg, Al suffers from the formation of an oxide layer several nanometers thick that limits the UV plasmonic performance. Although encapsulating the metal core within chemically inert ultrathin silica shells is a strategy to overcome this issue, it is difficult to implement given the not-easy-to-control thickness of the SiO 2 shell [194][195][196]. Ga is interesting for its self-terminating oxide monolayer, but it has an intrinsic low electrical conductivity besides the melting point near room temperature that hinders its manipulation [197,198]. Interestingly, Bi NPs prepared by laser ablation in solution [199] display LSPRs from the near UV to the IR absorption region. By using such Bi NPs as a SERS platform, the spectra of several amino acids were obtained [199], thus indicating that Bi could be considered an interesting material for the SERS detection of biomolecules, a task that is usually pursued by means of Ag and Au nanostructures. We outline that Bi plasmons lie in the UV region, whereas the Raman experiments were carried out with visible lasers [199], namely in correspondence of the tail of the optical absorption curve. Therefore, it is not possible to fully assess whether the Raman enhancement is purely electromagnetic, or chemical.Theoretical studies predict that metals with a large negative real part and a small imaginary part of the dielectric constant in the UV are suitable candidates for UV-SERS [191].

        <p>The first SERS report is due to Bilmes et al. [201] who observed an increased pyridine Raman activity on an electrochemically roughened Rh substrate. The observed enhancement was very low because visible radiation was employed as the exciting source (far from the wavelength of the Rh SPR absorption peak); [206] reported on amorphous rhodium sulfide microbowls, which were successfully designed and synthesized with the guidance of theoretical calculations and characterized by an excellent SERS performance. The amorphous structure favors efficient interfacial charge transfer, and the bowl-like shape is beneficial for photon trapping by multiple light scattering.The first SERS report is due to Bilmes et al.

        <p>To date, the Rh nanostructures investigated were grown by electrochemical roughening of Rh surfaces [207] or by chemical methods using different Rh precursors [208]. The limited number of papers on UV-SERS is mainly because the application of deep-UV excitation very often leads to photo-degradation of the samples. The availability of a consistent SERS enhancement in the deep-UV spectral region would therefore allow recording Raman spectra with very low excitation power [190,209], which would be beneficial to reduce photo-degradation issues.To date, the Rh nanostructures investigated were grown by electrochemical roughening of Rh surfaces [207] or by chemical methods using different Rh precursors [208].

        <p>In the recent past, pulsed laser ablation was used to make planar homogeneous Rh thin films with thickness up to 1 µm for the realization of mirrors to be used in harsh environments [210,211]. Under proper experimental conditions, LAL allows for the production of colloidal Rh suspensions in a suitable liquid medium [212][213][214], which can be employed for the fabrication of nanostructured Rh substrates with SPR peak in the 250-320 nm region. These LAL-synthesized Rh NPs are almost spherical, and their size and density distributions are markedly affected by the liquid (water, or ethanol) selected for LAL: Rh NPs obtained in water are smaller than those obtained in ethanol. The extinction spectra of the two colloids show the contribution associated to the SPR of the Rh NPs below 400 nm but, for the samples prepared in ethanol, an additional absorption feature is observed around 340 nm, which may be ascribed to Rh-C bonds [215]. The size of the NPs is affected by the chemical interactions that occur during the ablation process, in turn determined by the liquid environment. As discussed in [212], XRD and XPS results show that ablation of Rh in water leads to the production of mixed Rh/Rh-oxide phases (RhO 2 and Rh 2 O 3 ), whereas in ethanol essentially metallic Rh NPs are produced, in agreement with [216].In the recent past, pulsed laser ablation was used to make planar homogeneous Rh thin films with thickness up to 1 µm for the realization of mirrors to be used in harsh environments [210,211].

        <p>By fabricating a simple conductometric platform with Rh NPs produced by LAL in water, Fazio et al. [212] have demonstrated the sensing properties of Rh nanostructures toward low concentration of hydrogen in air. Here, for the purpose of showing another potential application of Rh NPs produced by LAL in water, Fazio et al. report some early results on their SERS activity by considering the reference analyte Rhodamine 6G (R6G). By comparing the SERS spectrum of R6G on Rh NPs with the Raman spectrum acquired on bare glass under the same conditions (Figure 18a,b), the resulting enhancement factor is about 20, which shows the feasibility of using Rh NPs prepared by this technique as SERS substrates. The time-dependence of the SERS signal of R6G discloses the photo-induced degradation of the analyte adsorbed on the Rh/Rh-oxide NPs under the 457 nm laser irradiation (Figure 18c,d). Remarkably, a prompt and well-resolved SERS response is observed after just 3 s of irradiation. Then, after 110 s of irradiation, the strongest characteristic peak of R6G (1650 cm -1 ) almost completely disappears (the same peak weakens by a factor of 0.4 after 22 s of irradiation). The photo-activity of nanostructured Rh surfaces was reported previously [206]; the data in Figure 18 parallel such behavior, which requires a careful control of irradiation conditions to use Rh-based NPs as a SERS platform. LAL-synthesized Rh/Rh-oxide NPs arrays suitably arranged as thin films show a moderate SERS enhancement factor. Further optimizing the deposition conditions of the NPs is likely to improve the SERS performance of such substrates in the UV spectral region, which is of relevance for biological applications.By fabricating a simple conductometric platform with Rh NPs produced by LAL in water, Fazio et al.

        <p>Environmental pollution and the energy crisis, with the rapid expansion of industry, human settlements and the improvement of life quality, has been, in recent years, an emergency across the entire globe. Globally, about the 80% of wastewater is discharged untreated from human agglomerations; huge amounts (millions of tons) of wastewater containing different toxic volatile (VOC) organic and inorganic pollutants (e.g., heavy metals) and toxic sludge, are released into the environment without purification treatments. Among VOC, benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) are the most common and dangerous contaminants in petroleum refining operations and liquid-liquid extraction processes. The copresence of these compounds in the atmosphere with NOx under solar radiation generates photochemical oxidants leading to higher concentrations of ozone. Therefore, if in the past, attention was focused on water and fossil fuel resources availability, currently waterquality problems and modern green technology for energy production are mandatory.

        <p>The degradation mechanism of pollutants in water on the ZnO and TiO2 surface is similar and is achieved by hydroxylation reactions mediated by oxygen radicals. In detail, electron (e -)/hole (h + ) pairs are generated by semiconductor oxides under irradiation with specific energy; then, reduction and oxidation reactions take place on the photocatalyst surface. Reduction involving adsorbed O2, pollutants (P) and photo-generated electrons in the conduction band gives rise to oxidized free radicals (O 2 -• , HO 2 • ), which, in turn, degrade organic pollutants in the water. Photoholes (h + ) in the valence band are highly oxidizing towards H2O and O 2 -• and produce reactive species, such as O • and • OH, able to degrade most of organic molecules until their complete mineralization in H2O and CO2.The degradation mechanism of pollutants in water on the ZnO and TiO2 surface is similar and is achieved by hydroxylation reactions mediated by oxygen radicals.

        <p>We remark that most of the studies on photo-degradation are related to dye molecules, alcohols or other molecules in the field of pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin, etc). However, different kinds of pollutants are contained in industrial waters and wastewaters, from agricultural pollutants, inorganic pollutants (metals compounds, inorganic salts, heavy metals, mineral acids), plastic pollution, VOC. An internet search with keywords "photodegradation of volatile organic compounds" resulted in about 700 hits, compared with the 7000 for "photodegradation of MB" and 400,000 by editing the keyword "photodegradation". Literature lacks systematic investigation/rationalization of these dangerous contaminants. Among VOC, benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) are the most common and unsafe compounds in petroleum refining operations and liquid-liquid extraction processes. The copresence of these in the atmosphere with NO x and solar radiation generates photochemical oxidants leading to higher levels of ozone. The abatement of these contaminants is therefore mandatory.We remark that most of the studies on photo-degradation are related to dye molecules, alcohols or other molecules in the field of pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, ciprofloxacin, etc).

The treatment was carried out at pH 9 for 60 min. The second modified catalysts (AuTiO 2 ) was obtained, first by synthesizing Au NPs by laser ablation in water, by focusing the first harmonic (1064 nm) of a Nd:YAG on a pure gold (99%) target. Then a dispersion at 3% (w.) of Au NPs and TiO 2 in water was prepared. All catalysts were characterized by Raman, Diffuse Reflectance and Photoluminescence spectroscopies.Here we investigate the removal of BTX from contaminated industrial waters through photocatalysis by using modified TiO 2 nanocatalysts with the introduction of atomic defects or by joining TiO 2 with 3 wt%.

        <p>BTX aqueous solutions used for BTX photodegradation, came from an aromatic hydrocarbon extraction process that uses sulfolane as extraction solvent, in particular from a tank that collects waters from various sections of the BTX production plants, including the sulfolane extraction sections. In the Table 2 the percentage composition of employed industrial waters are reported together with the pH value. Industrial waters were then diluted until a concentration in benzene of 10 -3 M, being the component present at higher concentration. The photodegradation of the diluted industrial waters was conducted with a solar simulator and was monitored recording the UV-Vis optical density in the 225-275 nm range [282]. Photocatalytic data showed that the modifications induced by the laser treatment of TiO 2 led to a bandgap decrease as compared to the bare TiO 2 due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies and defects inside theTiO 2 , as shown in Figure 20. The bandgap value, calculated by a Kubelka-Munka function (i.e., F(R) plotting (F(R)hν)1/r as a function of the photon energy (hν)), exhibits a strong decrease after laser irradiation, from the 3.17 eV in unmodified TiO 2 to 3.03 eV in the laser-treated sample.

Micro-Raman spectra, obtained using the 530 nm excitation wavelength, of commercial TiO 2 agree with the typical peak position of the anatase phase (red curve). Its characteristic peak: E g (144 cm -1 ) is very intense. However, after laser irradiation, a significant change of the peak intensity and a shift of anatase vibrational features is observed. Such a change is ascribed to the generation of oxygen vacancies in the atomic structure of the catalyst. The trend observed is analogous to that reported [283], in samples for which the calculated value of the O/Ti atomic ratio is reduced to 1.88 with respect to the native value of 2.

By fixing the catalyst concentration in all experiments to 0.15 mg/mL, we have observed a negligible contribution of the catalyst into the BTX absorption spectra. The kinetics of disappearance of aromatic mixtures is displayed in Figure 21b (an adsorption period in the dark of 30 min). Photocatalytic degradation was performed in a closed box kept at low temperature in an ice bath to avoid evaporation of BTX from the solution, under strong stirring condition. The intensity decrease of the band at 254 nm, mainly associated to benzene electronic transitions [282], was monitored as a function of the irradiation time in a range of 80 min. In the presence of blue titania NPs, 76% of benzene, the most abundant component in the employed industrial waters, is removed after 80 min; after the same irradiation time, when AuTiO 2 NPs were employed as photo-catalyst a residual less than 1% of benzene in water was detected. Moreover, we obtained that, after only 5 min, the percentage of BTX decreased by 53% when Au-decorated TiO 2 is used; instead, when blue and commercial TiO 2 are employed as a photocatalyst, BTX decreases by 26% and 14%, respectively, during the same time.

It is clear that the interaction of Au with the surface of the TiO 2 catalyst enhances the catalytic process, thus degrading more quickly almost the entire pollutant. The improvement in the efficiency of the photodegradation process is not only related to the lower value of the energy bandgap of the catalyst (blue titania presents the lowest energy BG with respect to the other two catalysts), but it seems that the main responsible of the great improvement of the photoefficiency is due to the presence of Au NPs [260,271,272], that, thanks to the SPR and high electron density, are able to enhance the electron transfer from the Au NPs to the catalyst [273,274].</p>
        <p>To better understand the defect doping effect, blue titania was used as a catalyst to degrade single components of the BTX mixture. For this purpose, three solutions containing commercial Benzene, Toluene and Xylene, respectively, were prepared in millipore water at the same concentration of 10 -3 M.To better understand the defect doping effect, blue titania was used as a catalyst to degrade single components of the BTX mixture.

        <p>The photodegradation experiment was conducted under the same experimental conditions above described. The photoefficiency of blue titania towards the degradation of single aromatic compounds (benzene, toluene and xylene) 10 -3 M in millipore water are compared in Figure 21c. After 20 min, all pollutants reduced by 95% with respect to the initial concentration. It is to be noted that the lowest kinetic constant is obtained for the degradation of benzene. However, this value results three times higher than that obtained for BTX industrial waters. It seems [284] that benzene degrades less quickly when it is mixed with toluene. This finding could explain the difference in the kinetic rate and the lower value of kinetic constant related to the degradation of the BTX mixture, in which benzene is the most abundant component and toluene the second one.The photodegradation experiment was conducted under the same experimental conditions above described.

        <p>In this review, we reported on various laser-based methods for the generation of colloids with a tight control on their properties (the purity of the product, the selectivity in the crystal structure of the oxide, a fine control of the particle size distribution). The peculiar chemical-physical properties that new nanomaterials produced by LAL can offer have been described in view of specific technological applications and showed to be competitive with those of conventional chemical procedures. However, LAL colloids are not yet applicable on a large scale. To reach this purpose, we considered it essential to analyze in depth the fundamental LAL mechanisms, taking into account the multiple time-scale transient processes that take place under the different experimental conditions which, ultimately, determine the nanocolloids properties.In this review, we reported on various laser-based methods for the generation of colloids with a tight control on their properties (the purity of the product, the selectivity in the crystal structure of the oxide, a fine control of the particle size distribution).

        <p>Since about 2010 there has been a growing research and development of third-generation nanotechnologies, which are characterized by their multiscale architecture (i.e., involving macro-, meso-, micro-and nanoscales together) and three-dimensionality. Some applications driving the developments of third generation nanotechnologies are biosensors or drug-delivery vectors modelled on biological templates. After 2015, the fourth-generation nanotechnologies employ "molecular manufacturing", to achieve multifunctionality and the control of functions at a molecular level. The global deterioration of water, soil, and the atmosphere by the release of toxic chemicals from the ongoing anthropogenic activities is becoming a serious problem throughout the world. Thanks to the remarkable advances in nanotechnology and the urgent need to develop green, robust and economic approaches for innovative biomedical purposes and environmental remediation, LAL-prepared nanomaterials could be successfully used in biomedicine, in wastewater treatment systems, for the production of clean and sustainable energy sources (e.g., solar cells and hydrogen generation systems) and for the removal of organic pollutants by photocatalysis.Since about 2010 there has been a growing research and development of third-generation nanotechnologies, which are characterized by their multiscale architecture (i.e., involving macro-, meso-, micro-and nanoscales together) and three-dimensionality.

        <p>Despite their great potential, some aspects of the LAL processes and of their products need to be optimized. Strong efforts should be devoted to achieve higher colloidal stability, preventing aggregation phenomena and the formation of larger particles, which, for instance, affect the catalytic properties and could even lead to the inactivation of the material. Efforts should also be devoted to the embedding of plasmonic NPs in bulk-heterojunction solar cells to promote photo-conversion. Furthermore, to achieve the gram-scale production that is required for industrial applications it is essential to properly define a LAL procedure and protocol.Despite their great potential, some aspects of the LAL processes and of their products need to be optimized.

        <p>Although LAL-synthesized NPs are referred to as ligand/surfactant-free, they are not totally naked and still bear their own surface chemistry, i.e., some of the NP surface atoms are oxidized or complexed. Presently, an appropriate protocol to realize performance-oriented colloidal synthesis and processing in order to prepare more isochronous surface modification in metal and semiconductor NPs (also within a polymeric matrix) is still not defined. The latter is an urgent request of modern manufacturing based on laser ablation to make possible in-situ engineering, thereby opening the way to fabricate functionalized (or coated) NPs.Although LAL-synthesized NPs are referred to as ligand/surfactant-free, they are not totally naked and still bear their own surface chemistry, i.e., some of the NP surface atoms are oxidized or complexed.

        <p>Moreover, nanostructures have dimensions which are similar to those of subcell structures, like receptors, and for this reason they can strongly interact. This is an important opportunity which can be exploited, as above reported, using nanostructures with engineered functionalizations, for a theranostic targeted nanomedicine. Indeed, since NPs produced by LAL have appealing and controlled plasmonic properties, spanning from the visible to the UV region, they are excellent platforms for SERS applications, even though significant efforts should be spent to obtain a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the UV spectral region. To this purpose, further studies closely combining the features of LAL with the application demands of various functional materials are still necessary.Moreover, nanostructures have dimensions which are similar to those of subcell structures, like receptors, and for this reason they can strongly interact.
