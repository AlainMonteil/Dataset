        <p>The lack of new antibiotics in the pharmaceutical pipeline guides more and more researchers to leave the classical isolation procedures and to look in special niches and ecosystems. Bioprospecting of extremophilic Actinobacteria through mining untapped strains and avoiding resiolation of known biomolecules is among the most promising strategies for this purpose. With this approach, members of acidtolerant, alkalitolerant, psychrotolerant, thermotolerant, halotolerant and xerotolerant Actinobacteria have been obtained from respective habitats. Among these, little survey exists on the diversity of Actinobacteria in arid areas, which are often adapted to relatively high temperatures, salt concentrations, and radiation. Therefore, arid and desert habitats are special ecosystems which can be recruited for the isolation of uncommon Actinobacteria with new metabolic capability. At the time of this writing, members of Streptomyces, Micromonospora, Saccharothrix, Streptosporangium, Cellulomonas, Amycolatopsis, Geodermatophilus, Lechevalieria, Nocardia, and Actinomadura are reported from arid habitats. However, metagenomic data present dominant members of the communities in desiccating condition of areas with limited water availability that are not yet isolated. Furthermore, significant diverse types of polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes are detected in xerophilic and xerotolerant Actinobacteria and some bioactive compounds are reported from them. Rather than pharmaceutically active metabolites, molecules with protection activity against drying such as Ectoin and Hydroxyectoin with potential application in industry and agriculture have also been identified from xerophilic Actinobacteria. In addition, numerous biologically active small molecules are expected to be discovered from arid adapted Actinobacteria in the future. In the current survey, the diversity and biotechnological potential of Actinobacteria obtained from arid ecosystems, along with the recent work trend on Iranian arid soils, are reported.The lack of new antibiotics in the pharmaceutical pipeline guides more and more researchers to leave the classical isolation procedures and to look in special niches and ecosystems.

        <p>The need for new bioactive structures is substantially emphasized due to the serious consequence and dynamic nature of antibiotic resistance in pathogens. Correspondingly, the need for novel bioactive compound discovery, because of their potential agricultural, pharmaceutical or industrial applications, is great (Thumar et al., 2010).The need for new bioactive structures is substantially emphasized due to the serious consequence and dynamic nature of antibiotic resistance in pathogens.

        <p>Among different resources, the privileged chemical scaffolds and metabolic potential of Actinobacteria have made them among the most promising bioprospecting resources (Bérdy, 2015). The rate of discovery of novel bioactive compounds has dramatically reduced in bioprospecting. As a consequence, searching for undiscovered species is imperative to address this reduction. For this purpose, either the rare genera from normal habitats or under investigated species found in unusual habitats like deserts are recommended (Harwani, 2013). Finding new actinobacterial species will presumably lead to the discovery of potentially new structural and beneficial secondary metabolites (Thumar et al., 2010). The discovery of new bioactive compounds from taxonomically unique strains of extremophilic or extremotrophic Actinobacteria has led to the anticipation that mining these groups could add an alternative dimension to the line of secondary metabolite resources (Thumar et al., 2010). Extremophilic and extremotolerant Actinobacteria, including acidtolerant and alkalitolerant, psychrotolerant and thermotolerant, halotolerant and haloalkalitolerant or xerophiles comprise the group of less investigated of this bacteria. Actinobacteria dwelling in deserts are capable of growing under selective conditions of pH or salinity and encompass remarkable gene clusters to produce compounds with unique antibacterial activity. However, little data is available related to the Actinobacteria from arid habitats, which are among the most plenteous ecosystems with regard to the occurrence of new bacterial species (Thumar et al., 2010).Among different resources, the privileged chemical scaffolds and metabolic potential of Actinobacteria have made them among the most promising bioprospecting resources (Bérdy, 2015).

        <p>By analysis of the literature data, in this review, we present the necessity of mining drought adapted Actinobacteria, exploring arid ecosystems for actinobacterial distribution; reporting Actinobacteria of arid ecosystems including studies of Iranian arid soils and bioactive metabolites of drought adapted Actinobacteria.By analysis of the literature data, in this review, we present the necessity of mining drought adapted Actinobacteria, exploring arid ecosystems for actinobacterial distribution; reporting Actinobacteria of arid ecosystems including studies of Iranian arid soils and bioactive metabolites of drought adapted Actinobacteria.</p>
        <p>Actinobacteria are a Gram positive group often distinguished by a high mol% G+C ratio content, filamentous or non-filamentous, among which some genera produce spores (Ludwig et al., 2012). The class Actinobacteria comprises 5 subclasses, 10 orders, 56 families, and 286 genera (Euzeby, 2015).Actinobacteria are a Gram positive group often distinguished by a high mol% G+C ratio content, filamentous or non-filamentous, among which some genera produce spores (Ludwig et al., 2012).

        <p>Actinobacteria are autochthonous and often among the dominant population of their ecosystems. They have a ubiquitous distribution in the biosphere, including the extremobiosphere, and are regarded as being among the predominant components of the soil microbiota (Bull, 2011). Since the discovery of Streptomycin in 1943 (Schatz et al., 1944), the greatest number of antibiotics introduced into the market, including carbapenems (Cephalosporin), macrolides (Erythromycin), ansamycins (Rifampicin), glycopeptides (Vancomycin), and Tetracyclines (Demelocyclin), have been discovered from Actinobacteria. The number and diversity of biosynthetic gene clusters in their genomes, attendant with respect to the fact that only a fraction of the actinobacterial bioactive chemicals have been discovered to date, justify continuing their bioprospecting as the most promising source of novel bioactive molecules discovery.Actinobacteria are autochthonous and often among the dominant population of their ecosystems.

        <p>A number of environments can be considered extreme, either in terms of chemical (pH, salinity, water content) or physical parameters (temperature, pressure, radiation) (Bull, 2011). The extremophiles are evolved to thrive at or approximate to the extreme ranges of these physicochemical parameters. In contrast, a large number of microorganisms, referred to as extremotrophs, can grow but are not essentially optimized despite extreme conditions such as dilute nutrient availability that can be considered oligotroph rather than oligophile (Bull, 2011).A number of environments can be considered extreme, either in terms of chemical (pH, salinity, water content) or physical parameters (temperature, pressure, radiation) (Bull, 2011).

        <p>Members of Actinobacteria are recovered from a complete spectrum of extreme ecosystems. The existence of acidtolerant, alkaliphilic, psychrotolerant, thermotolerant, halotolerant, alkalitolerant, haloalkalitolerant, and xerophilous Actinobacteria has been reported (Lubsanova et al., 2014). Novel chemodiversity is more probable to be found in rare or recently cultivated strains. Therefore, the diversity of the extremobiosphere can resolve the challenge of rediscovery of previously known metabolites for a substantial period of time. For this reason, exploring the thriving Actinobacteria in extreme environments in order to obtain untapped strains is suggested. Although a few comprehensive investigations have been attempted on the bacterial diversity of arid ecosystems, the diversity of Actinobacteria from such environments has not been fully surveyed (Okoro et al., 2009).Members of Actinobacteria are recovered from a complete spectrum of extreme ecosystems.

        <p>Arid regions comprise the largest continental ecosystems (covering approximately 30% of all land area, of which 7% are hyper-arid) that are water-constrained. The arid areas are defined as biomes with a ratio of mean annual rainfall to mean annual evaporation of less than 0.05 and below 0.002 for extreme hyperarid areas (Bull, 2011). The extreme desiccation condition of hyper-arid deserts is often accompanied by high temperature, nM concentrations of nutrients, low water activity, and intense radiation, while in some ecosystems, low temperature, high salinity, pH or concentrations of metals, nitrate or sulfate and inorganic oxidant anions prevail in the arid area (Bull, 2011;Koeberl et al., 2011). Among these, the availability of water and nutrients are the cardinal limiting parameters of biological activity in arid and semi-arid ecosystems (Saul-Tcherkas et al., 2013). Bacteria embedded in low water activity niches must expend rather more energy to accumulate a defined amount of water and even the most resilient bacteria usually eventuates a state of hydrobiosis when water activity is reduced to below 0.88 aw, in which cells cease to metabolize, however, remain viable (Connon et al., 2007). Bacteria that thrive in arid habitats adjust their access to water required for their physiological requirements. Most of them are adjacent to mineral soils such as quartz, halites or gypsum; through dispersal, some water trapped in these minerals can be accessed for bacterial growth (Azua-Bustos et al., 2012).Arid regions comprise the largest continental ecosystems (covering approximately 30% of all land area, of which 7% are hyper-arid) that are water-constrained.

        <p>The correlation between environmental selection or stochastic processes related to the non-random dispersal of prokaryotes indicates the existence of bacterial biogeography, however, because of the exhaustive sampling required, differentiating the endemic species is difficult. Contrary to some definite similarities, arid habitats comprise diversified local physicochemical conditions that influence community structures. As a consequence, the composition of a bacterial community is the result of local environmental selection (Ragon et al., 2012) and is therefore endemic to the arid area. However, considerable population size and cell dormancy in Actinobacteria may have a much more determining effect on the structure of the various microbial communities, leading to different biogeographic patterns. The phylogeny-based biogeography investigation of bacteria is scarce and their functional-trait-based evaluations are even more rarely addressed (Krause et al., 2014). In addition to strain biogeography, conserved secondary metabolome enrichment patterns that are soil type-specific are also recognized in the bacterial world (Charlop-Powers et al., 2014).The correlation between environmental selection or stochastic processes related to the non-random dispersal of prokaryotes indicates the existence of bacterial biogeography, however, because of the exhaustive sampling required, differentiating the endemic species is difficult.

        <p>Arid regions are the interface across the often vegetated semi-arid areas and the biologically unproductive hyperarid deserts (Neilson et al., 2012). They harbor numerous unexplored xerophilic, thermophilic, halophilic and alkaliphilic Actinobacteria producing new bioactive metabolites. Applications of new methods can lead to the discovery of cultivable bacteria from deserts which were supposed to be sterile (Koeberl et al., 2011). The desert habitats are among the target ecosystems for the isolation of new extremophile or extremotroph strains of Actinobacteria which are more likely to produce new metabolites. Actinobacteria have exclusive tolerance to desiccation and solute stress among bacteria and they have been isolated from diverse, hostile environments such as arid and hyper-arid deserts, which are considered analogs of potential habitats on Mars (Neilson et al., 2012;Stevenson and Hallsworth, 2014). Although high levels of germination and growth at 0.5 aw is reported for Actinobacteria, non-halophilic species of Actinobacteria are unlikely to be metabolically active below 0.80 aw, however, they may be ecologically active in water constrained soil microhabitats that contain water activity above this value (Stevenson and Hallsworth, 2014). Despite the geographical extent of arid ecosystems, little is known about the bacterial populations of these habitats and their metabolic potential (Neilson et al., 2012). In this regard, few reports are available pertaining to the isolation, screening and ecological distribution of rare Actinobacteria from the desert ecosystem (Harwani, 2013). Additionally, habitats other than soils are also considered as new source areas with limited water availability (Azua-Bustos et al., 2012).Arid regions are the interface across the often vegetated semi-arid areas and the biologically unproductive hyperarid deserts (Neilson et al., 2012).

        <p>Recovered Actinobacteria from extremely hot and/or acidic ecosystems or habitats with severe radiation/desiccation conditions (such as deserts and other arid regions) tend to be representative of the deepest clads of Actinobacteria (Acidimicrobidae, Rubrobacteridae) (Bull, 2011). The extreme desiccating condition of deserts has been the main driving force in the evolution of the DNA repair mechanisms that has generated the resistance to ionizing radiation (UV and gamma), which is a characteristic of several desert-derived Actinobacteria (Makarova et al., 2001). The most resistant genera of such ecosystems are strains of Deinococcus and Geodermatophilus that tolerate up to 30 Gy of irradiation. Members of these genera have not yet been recovered from non-arid soil, even using irradiation pretreatments (Bull, 2011). Xerophilic Actinobacteria Geodermatophilus arenarius and G. siccatus were isolated from Saharan Desert sand in Chad (Harwani, 2013;Montero-Calasanz et al., 2013). Other members of the genus Geodermatophilus have been isolated from Negev Desert soil and from Mojave Desert soil along the California-Nevada border, together with Actinoplanes and Streptomyces strains using selective chemoattractants (Kurapova et al., 2012). The Geodermatophilaceae contains only two other genera of Blastococcus and Modestobacter, which thrive in the conditions of low availability of water and nutrients. Geodermatophilus prefers arid soils as natural habitats and out of 15 species described in this genus, at least nine species are isolated from the desert area (Euzeby, 2015), whereas Blastococcus and Modestobacter are inhabitants of rock surfaces (Montero-Calasanz et al., 2012). An actinobacterium from a desert soil in Egypt, Citricoccus alkalitolerans, was recognized as alkalitolerant and that its optimum growth occurs at pH 8.0-9.0 (Li et al., 2005). Novel strains of the non-sporulating actinobacterium Mycetocola manganoxydans that had the ability to oxidize manganese ions were isolated from the Takalima Desert (Luo et al., 2012). Members of the Terrabacteria genus are also characterized by adaptations to desiccation, radiation, and high salinity (Bull, 2011). Members of the genus Streptomyces such as Streptomyces deserti from the hyper-arid Atacama Desert are also reported from arid habitats (Harwani, 2013;Santhanam et al., 2013), Streptomyces bullii from the hyper-arid Atacama Desert (Santhanam et al., 2013) or the moderately thermophilic xerotolerant Streptomyces sp. 315 from Mongolian desert soil (Kurapova et al., 2012). In addition to Streptomyces, strains belonging to Micromonospora, Saccharothrix, Streptosporangium, and Cellulomonas were obtained from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Ding et al., 2013a), while Micromonospora, Actinomadura, and Nocardiopsis were reported from soda saline soils of the ephemeral salty lakes in Buryatiya (Lubsanova et al., 2014).Recovered Actinobacteria from extremely hot and/or acidic ecosystems or habitats with severe radiation/desiccation conditions (such as deserts and other arid regions) tend to be representative of the deepest clads of Actinobacteria (Acidimicrobidae, Rubrobacteridae) (Bull, 2011).

        <p>Thermotolerant and thermophilic actinomycetes were found in high abundance, exceeding that of the mesophilic forms, in Mongolian desert soils. Members of Streptomyces, Micromonospora, Actinomadura, and Streptosporangium were the most widespread thermotolerant species in desert soils (Kurapova et al., 2012). Beside Streptomyces, members affiliated to the actinobacterial genera of Micromonospora, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, Saccharopolyspora, and Nonomuraea have been identified from the solar salterns of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea and inland around the Sambhar Salt Lake (Jose and Jebakumar, 2012). Interestingly, it is reported that Actinobacteria (20.7% of desert soil and 4.6% of agricultural soil) occur at lower concentrations in farmland compared to the surrounding desert (Ding et al., 2013b)..

        <p>In particular, the resistance of halotolerant Actinobacteria (isolated from saline soils of arid territories) to alkaline conditions, high temperature and drought has experimentally been demonstrated. It was found that all the halotolerant strains (which were capable of growth at 5% NaCl), unlike unhalophilic strains, were able to grow on a medium that contained soda at pH 10, while non-halophilic strains do not possess such an ability. In this respect, a moderate thermophilic strain of Streptomyces fumigatiscleroticus 315 HE578745 that was isolated from the desert soil was experimentally shown to be xerotolerant (Lubsanova et al., 2014). The halotolerant alkaliphilic Streptomyces aburaviensis was isolated from the saline desert of Kutch in India that selectively inhibits the growth of Gram positive bacteria. It was able to grow at 15% w/v NaCl with slow growth at neutral pH, while optimum growth was in the range of 5-10% NaCl and at pH 9 (Thumar et al., 2010). Mesophilic Actinobacteria of the Mongolian desert soils ecosystem was represented by the genus Streptomyces, whereas thermotolerants were represented by the genera of Micromonospora, Actinomadura, and Streptosporangium (Kurapova et al., 2012).In particular, the resistance of halotolerant Actinobacteria (isolated from saline soils of arid territories) to alkaline conditions, high temperature and drought has experimentally been demonstrated.

        <p>Records of plant associated Actinobacteria from deserts also exist. Drought tolerant endophytic Actinobacteria, Streptomyces coelicolor DE07, S. olivaceus DE10, and S. geysiriensis DE27 were recovered from plants of arid and drought affected regions. These strains exhibited plant growth promotion activity and intrinsic water stress tolerance (-0.05 to -0.73 MPa) (Yandigeri et al., 2012). Some extremophilic bacteria, such as Acidimicrobium, Rubellimicrobium, and Deinococcus-Thermus, dramatically diminish following agricultural use. In contrary, indigenous desert bacteria can improve plant health in desert agro-ecosystems (Koeberl et al., 2011).Records of plant associated Actinobacteria from deserts also exist.

        <p>Actinobacteria from a low water activity area of Antarctica (similar to the situation in deserts) are also described. The bacterial diversity of Lake Hodgson, the Antarctic Peninsula, was recognized as 23% Actinobacteria, 21% Proteobacteria, 20.2% Plantomycetes, and 11.6% Chlorofllexi (Pearce et al., 2013), while from Antarctic Dry Valley soil Cyanobacteria (13%), Actinobacteria (26%), and Acidobacteria (16%) represented the majority of the identified resident bacteria (Smith et al., 2006). Culture-independent survey of multidomain bacterial diversity in the cold desert of the McKelvey Valley demonstrated that highly specialized communities colonize in distinct lithic niches occurring concomitantly within this ecosystem. Despite the relatively devoid soil, the greatest diversity was observed in endoliths and chasmoliths of sandstone. It indicated that the dominant communities are Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. The only ubiquitous phyla in the Dry Valley zone were Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria. The overlying rock creates a favorable sub-lithic microhabitat where physical stability, desiccation buffering, water availability and irradiation protection are further provided for bactaeria (Pointing et al., 2009).Actinobacteria from a low water activity area of Antarctica (similar to the situation in deserts) are also described.

        <p>The culture independent study of Actinobacteria has demonstrated the dominant diversity and distribution of this phylum in arid areas. Hyper-arid soils of Yungay were shown to harbor actinobacterial OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Unit) mostly related to Frankia rather than the Nitriliruptoraceae and Rubrobacteraceae families that are recognized as dominant at the hyper-arid margin (Connon et al., 2007). Contrary to the fact that both regions have a sorely low level of organic substrates, higher bacterial diversity was found in the hyper-arid margin, potentially related to the mean annual rainfall and exposure to past vegetation history. Even within the hyper-arid margin, fine variations in physicochemical parameters may have a strong effect on the taxonomic diversity of actinobacterial communities (Neilson et al., 2012).The culture independent study of Actinobacteria has demonstrated the dominant diversity and distribution of this phylum in arid areas.

        <p>Actinobacteria from Salar and extreme hyper-arid soils have been isolated using the application of pretreatment or selective media and members of at least 12 genera have been reported. A remarkable proportion of these isolates belonged to rare genera and represented new species. Members of the Streptomyces genus are reported as being remarkably abundant in Atacama Desert habitats and a distinguished clade with a widespread range of antibacterials and differing modes of action has been isolated from this desert. These Streptomyces strains are in fact Salar adapted ecovars (Bull and Asenjo, 2013). By application of a confined type of isolation media, strains of genera, including Nocardia, Microlunatus, Prauserella, and Streptomyces were recovered, and around 50% of them produced carotenoids with antibacterial activity, even against Gram negative bacteria (Namitha and Neqi, 2010). Aminobenzoquinones (rare combinations of benzoquinones and a range of amino acids) are reported from Streptomyces strains isolated from the Salar de Tara. Despite the poor antibacterial and antifungal activities of abenquines, inhibitory activity against type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4b) was revealed for them, suggesting that they can be further assessed for their anti-inflammatory activities (Schulz et al., 2011;Bull and Asenjo, 2013).

        <p>It is postulated that extremotolerants may have larger genetic and metabolic plasticity. Drought and radiation are lifecontrolling determinants, while habitat availability, temperature, pH and toxicants (high localized concentrations of elements such as arsenic) are among other principal determinants. Avoidance strategies to desiccation and intense radiation are evolved by bacteria, such as growth niche (hypo-and endo-lithic), extracellular polymer synthesis and pigmentation that protect the cell during epilithic colonization. Melanins are produced by many Actinobacteria thriving in extreme hyper-arid ecosystems. The dominant abundance of bacteria in a hyper-saline habitat was detected at a depth of about 2 m where water films had been formed by the aid of halite, nitrate and perchlorate salts. These suggest enough evidence to show that microorganisms in desert environments can be metabolically functional and not necessarily dormant or non-functional cells (Bull and Asenjo, 2013).It is postulated that extremotolerants may have larger genetic and metabolic plasticity.

        <p>In desert habitats, the availability of water and organic substrates are among the main parameters limiting the ability of bacteria to maintain their metabolic functions (Saul-Tcherkas et al., 2013). Organic substrates can originate from the chemical profile of the plant root exudates, which induces variability in the associated bacterial composition of the arid soil (Saul-Tcherkas et al., 2013). These ecophysiological conformities such as excretion of chemicals, support an allelopathic habitat by altering the levels of organic matter and soil moisture.
