        <p>While it seems indisputable that potable water contains microplastics (MP), the actual concentrations are much debated and reported numbers vary many orders of magnitude. It is difficult to pinpoint the cause of these differences, but it might be variation between waters, variation between quantification methods, and that some studies did not live up to rigorous analytical standards. Despite the urgent need to understand human exposure by drinking water, there is a lack of trustable methods generating reliable data. Essentially, proper MP assessment requires that quality assurance is in place and demonstrated, that an adequate volume of drinking water is assessed, and that differences in analytical methods are understood. This study presents a systematic and robust approach where MP down to 6.6 μm were assessed in potable water distribution systems in terms of quantity, size, shape, and material. For the first time, sub-samples were analysed by two of the most validated and complementary analytical techniques: μFTIR imaging and Py-GCMS. Both methods successfully determined low contents in drinking water. However, μFTIR and Py-GCMS identified different polymer types in samples with overall low MP content. With increasing concentration of a given polymer type, the values determined by the techniques became more comparable. Most detected MPs were smaller than 150 μm, and 32% were smaller than 20 μm. Our results indicate a potential annual uptake of less than one MP per person, suggesting that drinking potable water produced at a high-performance drinking water treatment plant represents a low risk for human health.While it seems indisputable that potable water contains microplastics (MP), the actual concentrations are much debated and reported numbers vary many orders of magnitude.

        <p>We are living in the Anthropocene with all kind of plastic materials omnipresent in our daily life. The broad application of plastics in packaging technology, constructions, and other industries leads to a current global annual production of almost 360 million metric tons ( PlasticsEurope, 2019 ). Due to their durability, most plastic types are poorly degradable, but rather become brittle over time and subsequently fractionate into ever-smaller pieces. The resulting microplastics (MPs) generally refer to plastic fragments ≤ 5 mm ( Arthur et al., 2009 ;Barnes et al., 2009 ). Sub-categories differentiating between large MP (5 mm-500 μm) and small MP (500-1 μm) are frequently used ( Primpke et al., 2020 ). During the past years, there has been a rapidly growing concern about MPs and researchers all over the globe started exploring their abundance, composition and morphology in various matrixes using different visual and analytical tools such as FTIR-, GCMS-, or Raman-based methods for MP identification. Hence, MPs have been reliably assessed in natural and anthropogenic environments (aquatic, terrestrial, and indoor and outdoor air) ( Alimi et al., 2018 ;Horton et al., 2017 ;Vianello et al., 2019 ), but also in food, and drinking water, both bottled and tap water ( Cox et al., 2019 ).We are living in the Anthropocene with all kind of plastic materials omnipresent in our daily life.

        <p>The omnipresence of plastics in all aspects of human life means that humans are inevitably exposed to MPs on a daily basis. It has been suggested that MPs enter the human gastro-intestine by the direct ingestion via, e.g. contaminated nourishment or beverages, causing a daily intake of MPs by the human body. Investigations of human stool showed that, at least partly, "what goes in, goes out" for MPs bigger than 50 μm ( Schwabl et al., 2019 ). Nonetheless, the scientific community agrees that it becomes especially relevant to identify small ( &lt; 500 μm) and very small ( &lt; 20 μm) MPs, as MPs smaller than 500 μm have been suggested capable of passing the gut wall ( Lusher et al., 2017 ) and MPs smaller than 20 μm have been demonstrated to accumulate in the liver, kidneys, and guts of mice ( Deng et al., 2017 ).The omnipresence of plastics in all aspects of human life means that humans are inevitably exposed to MPs on a daily basis.

        <p>Despite the implications for human health, limited research has been carried out on MPs in drinking water, and previous studies focused primarily on MPs in freshwater used for drinking water production rather than on the water directly consumed ( Koelmans et al., 2019 ). Only a few studies focused on the quantification of MPs in bottled water ( Mason et al., 2018 ;Oßmann et al., 2018 ;Schymanski et al., 2018 ) or potable water ( Kosuth et al., 2018 ;Mintenig et al., 2019 ;Pivokonsky et al., 2018 ;Shruti et al., 2020 ). Additionally, the MP numbers reported in these studies vary by nearly 6 orders of magnitude, from 0.001 to 470 MPs/L ( Kosuth et al., 2018 ;Mintenig et al., 2019 ;Pivokonsky et al., 2018 ;Shruti et al., 2020 ). Additionally, the authors sampled drinking water from different sources (ground-or surface water) in various countries and used different tools for MP identification, ranging from simple visual inspection to state-of-the-art μFTIR and micro-Raman analyses ( Kosuth et al., 2018 ;Mintenig et al., 2019 ;Pivokonsky et al., 2018 ;Shruti et al., 2020 ). Hence, the discrepancy in findings points out the need for research on drinking water from different sources and countries, but also the comparison of different methods used for MP identification. As mentioned above, several methods are currently used for MP qualification and quantification, which makes a proper comparison of results throughout different studies challenging. The majority of published studies refer to MPs in terms of particle number within some size range ( Löder et al., 2017 ). Such data is essential when assessing its environmental, ecological, or human health impacts, but insufficient when assessing the "MP concentration" in a respective matrix. Here, additionally, the mass of MPs must be quantified ( Simon et al., 2018 ), representing a significant analytical problem as the spectroscopic based methods are well-suited for determination of chemical composition, size and shape, but less suited for quantification of mass ( Liu et al., 2019 ). Thermoanalytical methods such as Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (Py-GCMS) generally require larger particle masses compared to vibrational microscopy orientated methods. However, such an approach enables the characterisation of plastics' additives in the sample as well as the quantification of nanosized particles if an appropriate volume and an effective concentration step are considered.Despite the implications for human health, limited research has been carried out on MPs in drinking water, and previous studies focused primarily on MPs in freshwater used for drinking water production rather than on the water directly consumed ( Koelmans et al., 2019 ).

        <p>Information on small and very small MPs is limited, and its consequences to human health are far from being understood. Hence, our primary focus was to strengthen the knowledge on MP quality and quantity, including very small MPs ( &lt; 20 μm) in drinking water in terms of both mass and numbers. A further intention was to compare the MP mass assessment of FPA-μFTIR-Imaging and Py-GCMS in real potable water matrices. This combination of analytical approaches and this particular matrix is novel, and it is the ambition that it leads to an increased confidence in the obtained results, and the accuracy of both analytical techniques when assessing the content of small MPs in drinking water.Information on small and very small MPs is limited, and its consequences to human health are far from being understood.

        <p>Starting at a Swedish high-performance drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), sampling locations were chosen along two drinking water distribution pipes of different age. The concentration, composition, size and morphology, as well as the related estimated mass of MPs was determined by μFTIR, and potential differences between pipe systems were assessed. The identification of MPs using μFTIR microscopy followed by an automated image analysis enabled us to quantify and qualify MP content and mass in each sample and to compare these data with MP concentrations determined via Py-GCMS. Recently, Koelmans et al. (2019) pointed out, that only four out of fifty reviewed studies on MPs in fresh-, drinking-, and wastewater scored positive on defined quality criteria, which were related to sampling, sample treatment, use of controls, analytical procedure, and polymer identification. In order to ensure and control the quality of our data, we: 1. analysed sample triplicates, and 2. analysed one blank per sampling location, 3. aimed for representative sample size, 4. followed highest standards during sampling, storage, and sample processing, and 5. assessed the full sample volume using the two complementary, reliable, and state-of-the-art polymer identification methods, namely μFTIR and Py-GCMS.Starting at a Swedish high-performance drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), sampling locations were chosen along two drinking water distribution pipes of different age.

        <p>The DWTP Sydvatten AB produces and supplies drinking water to 90 0,0 0 0 inhabitants in the south of Sweden (Skåne). The DWTP uses surface water originating from the lake Vombsjön for drinking water production. In general, drinking water production is based on artificial groundwater infiltration. Therefore, raw water seeps slowly through the alluvium of gravel and sand to natural groundwater storage. The so produced artificial groundwater is following pumped up and is initially aerated in order to remove iron and manganese and, following calcium ions are removed by the addition of sodium hydroxide. The resulting precipitate is removed by sedimentation. Next, chemical cleaning with a minor dosage of ferrous chloride takes place followed by sand bed filtration. Finally, the water is disinfected and pumped into the distribution network ( Sydvatten, 2016 ). Sampling took place between May 13th and 16th 2019. Our goal was to follow treated drinking water produced and supplied by the DWTP Vombverket in order to cover variability in MP abundance of a similar source. Starting at Vombverket, we followed two supply pipelines 1. the pipe Vombverket (V) -Björnstorp (BJP) -Genarp (BJH), which was built in 2011, but first taken into use in 2018 and 2. the pipeline Vombverket (V) -Bonderup (BOP) -Genarp (BOH), which was built and used since 20 0 0. The pipeline between Vombverket -Björnstorp -Genarp measures 3.9 km. The pipeline between Vombverket -Bonderup -Genarp measures 5 km. At both pipelines, samples were taken in parallel one day each, at a pumping station (sample sets BJP and BOP) and the corresponding hydrants (sample sets BJH and BOH) respectively.The DWTP Sydvatten AB produces and supplies drinking water to 90 0,0 0 0 inhabitants in the south of Sweden (Skåne).

        <p>At each station, triplicates of drinking water samples were filtered in parallel through 5 μm stainless steel filters (Haver &amp; Boecker OHG, Germany), that were placed in custom modified stainless steel filter holders (Sterlitech Corporation, United States) attached via stainless steel pipes (Figure S1). The inlet tube was attached directly to a water tap at the pipe or to a hydrant. The water flow was adjusted to approximately 10 L min -1 . A flowmeter (Zenner International GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany) was connected to each of the outlet tubes of the stainless steel filtration units to determine the volume of filtered water of each replicate. At each sampling position, the complete setup was primed for ten minutes prior to applying filters. Between 20 0 and 110 0 L of drinking water were filtered (Table S3). We aimed for 1 m 3 sample size, and the filtration was stopped earlier when stainless steel filters clogged, which led to a significant reduction of the water flow. After completion, the filters were transferred to muffled glass Petri dishes, covered with 70% ethanol and stored frozen at -20 °C until further processing.At each station, triplicates of drinking water samples were filtered in parallel through 5 μm stainless steel filters (Haver &amp; Boecker OHG, Germany), that were placed in custom modified stainless steel filter holders (Sterlitech Corporation, United States) attached via stainless steel pipes (Figure S1).

        <p>When working with samples produced for human consumption or where MP concentrations are expected to be low, it is of ut-most importance to mitigate and control contamination. Therefore, the equipment used in our study was muffled at 500 °C or extensively rinsed with particle-free water (0.7 μm filtered) prior to use. All solutions used were filtered before trough a 0.7 μm glass fibre filter. In order to prevent airborne contamination, sample preparation was carried out in a laminar flow bench (Labogene, Scan-Laf Fortuna Clean Bench, Denmark) or in a lab equipped with a Dustbox® (Hochleitungsluftreiniger, Germany) unit with HEPA filter (H14, 7.5 m 2 ). Since contamination can never be completely excluded, one blank sample was taken at each station (Figure S1, Table S1), by using a cascade filtration consisting of a glass fibre (GF) filter of 0.7 μm pore size in front of the stainless steel filter. Furthermore, wet sedimentation traps loaded with 500 mL of 0.7 μm fibreglass filtered Milli Q water in the Py-GCMS room to QA/QC any contamination source during analysis. All blank samples were treated and analysed in parallel to the respective drinking water samples.When working with samples produced for human consumption or where MP concentrations are expected to be low, it is of ut-most importance to mitigate and control contamination.

        <p>In the laboratory, samples were thawed and treated in "sets of stations" of three replicates each plus the respective blank sample under a laminar flow bench. The stainless steel filters were transferred into muffled glass beakers and incubated in 5% SDS for 24 h at 50 °C. Subsequently, filters were ultra-sonicated for five minutes (Elmasonic S50R, Germany). The filters were thoroughly flushed before being placed on a glass filtration unit. SDS was removed from the sample by flushing the beaker and the filtration unit intensively with particle-free Milli Q water and 50% ethanol. Subsequently, particles were flushed off the filters with particlefree 50% ethanol back into the beaker. Beakers were immediately covered with aluminium foil to prevent evaporation.In the laboratory, samples were thawed and treated in "sets of stations" of three replicates each plus the respective blank sample under a laminar flow bench.

        <p>The abundance and chemical composition of the extracted MPs from drinking water was determined using a Focal Plane Array (FPA) -based Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) imaging technique. For this, a Cary 620 FTIR microscope coupled with a Cary 670 IR spectroscope (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used to scan the entire area of the enriched zinc selenide transmission windows (active diameter 10 mm, active area 78.5 mm 2 ). The microscope was equipped with a 25x Cassegrain objective producing 3.3 μm pixel resolution on a 128 × 128 mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) FPA detector. All scans were carried out in transmission mode with a spectral range of 3750 -850 cm -1 at 8 cm -1 resolution applying 30 co-added scans in transmission mode. A background tile was collected before each sample's scan, using the same parameters but co-adding 120 scans instead of 30.The abundance and chemical composition of the extracted MPs from drinking water was determined using a Focal Plane Array (FPA) -based Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) imaging technique.

        <p>After investigation via μFTIR, the remaining sub-samples were submitted to Py-GCMS analysis. The remaining aliquots of each of the ethanol/water suspended samples, ranging from 48 -80% of the initial volume, were transferred onto a pre-muffled fibreglass filter (0.7 μm pore size) according to Gomiero et al. (2019) . Filters were folded on pre-burnt pyrolysis cups and spiked with 10 μL of 25% tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution in water to derivatise the samples, hence allowing also the determination of previously polar and/or non-volatile compound. Pyrolysis cups were covered with a muffled glass beaker and dried on a heating plate at 30 °C overnight. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry analysis was performed following Gomiero et al. (2019) . Eight amongst the most commonly used plastic polymers such as: polyethylene -PE, polypropylene -PP, polystyrene -PS, polyvinyl chloride -PVC, polyamide -PA 6,6; polymethyl methacrylate -PMMA, Polycarbonate -PC and polyethylene terphtalate -PET were investigated. Mass-based concentrations were calculated by fitting the obtained results onto calibration curves obtained by pyrolysing standard certified plastic polymers obtained from Goodfellow Ltd (Huntingdon, England). The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated according to Hermabessiere et al. (2018) . Following, an evaluation of the signal to noise ratios (S/N) of the detected peaks at the lowest concentration levels in the calibration curves allowed the extrapolation to a 10:1 ratio pointing to the LOQ (Table S2). Obtained results are reported as μg of polymer type / L of sample.After investigation via μFTIR, the remaining sub-samples were submitted to Py-GCMS analysis.

Obtained results are reported as μg of polymer type / L of sample.</p>
        <p>The collected FPA-μFTIR-Imaging data were analysed using the software 
            <rs type="software">siMPle</rs> ( Primpke et al., 2020 ) to automatically detect and quantify the particle content in each sample and blank sample, as well as measuring each particle's size and estimating its volume and mass. The size detection limit is defined by a combination of the filter size (5 μm) and the detection limit of the μFTIR. While the latter produced pixel sizes of 3.3 μm, a manual examination of the FTIR spectra showed that 'particles' represented by only 1 pixel on the FPA sometimes were false positives. When the particles comprised 2-3 pixels, the identification could be trusted. Therefore, the minimum particle size was set to three pixels, resulting in a minimum nominal size of 6.6 μm (i.e. a 'triangle' of pixels with a length and width of 2 pixels -6.6 μm). To evaluate the quality and reliability of our data, we manually checked the respective spectra/reference of representative mapped minimum and maximum sized MPs of all detected polymer types (Figure S3).

        <p>Assuming an elliptical MP shape, the minor dimension was calculated from the major dimension, as the longest linear distance perpendicular to the major axis ( Simon et al., 2018 ). To distinguish the MPs morphologically from each other, they were divided according to their dimensions into particles and fibres. An adjusted definition provided by the World Health Organization for the determination of airborne fibres was used, in which fibres are distinguished as objects with a length-width ratio of &gt; 3 from particles with a ratio of ≤ 3 ( Vianello et al., 2019 ). In order to calculate MP mass, the particle volume was estimated by assuming that particles are ellipsoids. The third dimension was defined as 0.67 times the minor dimension, respectively. Consequently, the mass was estimated based on the resulting particle volume and the respective density of the polymer ( Simon et al., 2018 ).Assuming an elliptical MP shape, the minor dimension was calculated from the major dimension, as the longest linear distance perpendicular to the major axis ( Simon et al., 2018 ).

A non-parametric ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test was used at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05 to compare univariate groups. For multivariate analysis, MP numbers (nMP) and MP mass (mMP) were normalised by calculating their abundances per m 3 . In order to cope with undefined resemblances, a dummy variable ( X + 1) was added. Principal coordinates analysis (PCO) was performed using Bray-Curtis similarity on fourth root transformed data, to visualise patterns in polymer type composition.

In general, we observed an average contamination of 46 ± 63 MPs / blank ( n = 5).

Since sample replication ( n = 3) did not allow to obtain a significant result on the level p = 0.05, pairwise tests between stations were not carried out.

        <p>To characterise size and shape of detected MPs, major and minor dimensions were evaluated.

According to the threshold used for fibre classification (length-width ratio of &gt; 3), 46 out of 238 (19%) of all detected MPs were fibres. Hence, the remaining 81% were defined as particles ( Fig. 3 b). The identified fibres composition was dominated by polyester (87%), followed by PE (9%) and a single PP fibre. The biggest MP was detected in a sample of BOH with 374 μm in major and 76 μm in minor dimension and consisted of polyester (PET).

        <p>The primary goal of our study was to strengthen the knowledge on MP quality and quantity, including very small MPs ( &lt; 20 μm), in drinking water. Through the combination of representative sample size, quality control and assurance together with state-of-theart μFTIR imaging and Py-GCMS, MPs could be qualified and quantified in all analysed drinking water of the investigated distribution system. Average MPs concentrations were generally low (between zero and 0.022 ± 0.019 MPs/L) except one pumping station which had considerably higher MPs numbers (0.809 ± 0.688 MPs/L). Hence, our results are within the range of MP numbers reported by other studies ( Kosuth et al., 2018 ;Mintenig et al., 2019 ;Pivokonsky et al., 2018 ;Shruti et al., 2020 ). Comparable to our study, Mintenig et al. (2019) reported low MP numbers in drinking water (0.001 MPs/L) using a μFTIR approach. This aspect contrasts with the studies by Pivokonsky et al. (2018) , Kosuth et al. (2018) , and Shruti et al. (2020) which reported substantially higher MP numbers (6, 18, and 470 MPs/L, respectively). It is important to note that these three studies only analysed small sample volumes (0.5 -1 L), and used either a visual staining-based approach or Micro-Raman spectroscopy, making a comparison with our data hardly possible.The primary goal of our study was to strengthen the knowledge on MP quality and quantity, including very small MPs ( &lt; 20 μm), in drinking water.

        <p>For MPs, identification via μFTIR imaging has proven efficient ( Bergmann et al., 2019 ;Liu et al., 2019 ;Mintenig et al., 2019 ;Simon et al., 2018 ). This technique allows scanning of large areas of filters or windows for the presence of MP and has been successfully applied down to 10 μm MP particles. In the present study, we further decreased this size limit by applying a 25x Cassegrain objective producing 3.3 μm pixel resolution, which allowed us to determine particles down to 6.6 μm. This imaging technique also allows the automatisation of MP identification and has been proven as a reliable tool for MP analysis ( Primpke et al., 2020( Primpke et al., , 2019 ) ). While single-point FTIR or Raman spectroscopy for the larger particles and μFTIR or μRaman imaging spectroscopy for the smaller particles allow high-quality microplastic quantification, the techniques are time-consuming and require advanced analytical equipment. Pyrolysis GC-MS ( Hendrickson et al., 2018 ;Gomiero et al., 2019 ;Fischer et al., 2019) and thermal desorption GC-MS (Dümichen et al., 2015;2019) is also an option for determining the polymer composition of the particles which has received increased attention. For screening purposes where estimates suffice, simple techniques such as chemical staining have been suggested and applied to some matrices (Shim et al., 2016;Maes et al., 2017). However, there still are many unanswered questions, here amongst which plastic types this approach can target, how applicable the approach is on complex matrixes, and whether or not it is faster than the FTIR based techniques.For MPs, identification via μFTIR imaging has proven efficient ( Bergmann et al., 2019 ;Liu et al., 2019 ;Mintenig et al., 2019 ;Simon et al., 2018 ).

        <p>Microplastics can enter freshwater environments in various ways. They can originate from degraded plastic waste, industrial effluents, surface run-off and wastewater effluents, but also from sewer overflows and atmospheric deposition ( Horton et al., 2017 ;Müller et al., 2020 ). In this context, drinking water treatment processes are essential to ensure adequate water quality, but they are not completely efficient in removing MPs, as MP removal ranges between 70% and 82% ( Pivokonsky et al., 2018 ). Beside incomplete removal during water purification, the deterioration of plastic equipment used during water purification or distribution is likely a source for MPs in drinking water, as pipes in DWTPs are frequently made of PVC, PP, and PE ( Mintenig et al., 2019 ). In the present study, surface water served as source for drinking water production. Since the raw water was not investigated, we cannot evaluate the MP removal efficiency of the DWTP. Nevertheless, since MPs are generally in lower concentrations than in raw waters ( Pivokonsky et al., 2018 ), the low MP concentrations we found at the high-performance DWTP and most of the following distribution system point towards a successful MP removal during drinking water treatment. Further investigations are needed in order to assess how MPs concentrations in potable water can be influenced by pre-treatment methods in DWP and the corresponding economic levels, in particular raw water sources.Microplastics can enter freshwater environments in various ways.

        <p>Here, we also assessed the potential differences in MP loads between two distribution pipes of different age (8 vs. 19 years). The investigated distribution pipes mainly consist of cement, stainless steel, cast iron, and PE. Considering the low numbers of PE detected in the samples, it can be concluded that ten years' age difference had no significant impact on the MP loads in the distribution system. This finding is supported due to the fact that water is generally not reactive with PE and that 50 to 100year service of PE potable water pipes used for pressurised, cold and/or hot water were projected ( Whelton et al., 2009 ). However, the investigated sampling locations differed significantly in their polymer composition. In total, we identified eight different polymer types, including PA, polyester, acrylic, PVC, PS, PE, PU, and PP in drinking water throughout all samples. Previously anal-ysed drinking water samples mainly contained polyester, PVC, PE, PA, and PP particles ( Kosuth et al., 2018 ;Mintenig et al., 2019 ;Shruti et al., 2020 ). In the present study, polyester MP numbers were significantly higher at one pumping station (BJP). In contrast, Mintenig et al. (2019) reported no differences in MP numbers or composition at different stages of the distribution system (waterworks vs household). Generally, airborne contamination is a likely source for polyester. However, given the low numbers of polyester in the blank samples, contamination of our samples with polyester during sampling or processing is unlikely. The high polyester loads were determined in the lowest sample volume, which resulted from filter clogging by fine particulate matter. Neither at the DWTP, before the distribution system, nor at the respective hydrant such high MP abundances were recognised. Hence, our findings suggest a short term weakness/damage in the pipeline at the time of sampling, presumably due to construction work or the like.Here, we also assessed the potential differences in MP loads between two distribution pipes of different age (8 vs. 19 years).

Generally, airborne contamination is a likely source for polyester. However, given the low numbers of polyester in the blank samples, contamination of our samples with polyester during sampling or processing is unlikely. The high polyester loads were determined in the lowest sample volume, which resulted from filter clogging by fine particulate matter. Neither at the DWTP, before the distribution system, nor at the respective hydrant such high MP abundances were recognised. Hence, our findings suggest a short term weakness/damage in the pipeline at the time of sampling, presumably due to construction work or the like.</p>
        <p>The few existing studies that quantified MPs in drinking water report numbers that vary by several orders of magnitude ( Kosuth et al., 2018 ;Mintenig et al., 2019 ;Pivokonsky et al., 2018 ;Shruti et al., 2020 ). This discrepancy indicates high variability of MP loads in drinking waters from different sources and countries. However, the studies are also hardly comparable due to different sampling, MP extraction, and identification methods, where MP identification represents one of the crucial pitfalls ( Käppler et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, MP numbers are commonly reported within size classes ( Löder et al., 2017 ) impeding the assessment of the "real" MP concentration and making it impossible to compare the data to analytical techniques quantifying the polymer mass. Previous work has demonstrated that both, ATR-FTIR and Py-GCMS successfully differentiate between plastic and non-plastic ( Hendrickson et al., 2018 ;Käppler et al., 2018 ) with identification of 85% as the same polymer type ( Käppler et al., 2018 ). For the first time, we analysed sub-samples via μFTIR imaging and Py-GCMS in order to compare MP concentrations, FTIR-based mass estimates, and directly determined mass concentrations. We successfully determined very low MP loads in drinking water, applying two μFTIR and Py-GCMS and obtaining comparable concentrations with the two complementary techniques. However, μFTIR and Py-GCMS identified different polymer types in samples with overall low MP concentrations, as i.e., PE was detected by μFTIR but not by Py-GCMS. Conversely, with increasing MP load of a given polymer type, the concentrations measured with both techniques became more comparable, as was the case for polyester. Underrepresentation of specific plastic types, due to concentrations below the respective polymer detection limit of Py-GCMS, is the most likely explanation for the differences in polymer composition observed between the different methods.The few existing studies that quantified MPs in drinking water report numbers that vary by several orders of magnitude ( Kosuth et al., 2018 ;Mintenig et al., 2019 ;Pivokonsky et al., 2018 ;Shruti et al., 2020 ).

        <p>Since accessible clean drinking water is one of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations ( WHO, 2017 ), it is of utmost importance to reliably investigate MPs and to determine numbers, concentration, and size, in order to understand and evaluate the potential risks related to human health. Considering that the annual estimated MP consumption ranges from 39,0 0 0 to 52,0 0 0 particles or 74,0 0 0 and 121,0 0 0 when inhalation is taken into account ( Cox et al., 2019 ), the generally low MP numbers of 0.174 MPs/L we found in the present study suggest that the consumption of drinking water, processed by a high-performance drinking water treat-ment plant, does not particularly add to potential risks to human health.Since accessible clean drinking water is one of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations ( WHO, 2017 ), it is of utmost importance to reliably investigate MPs and to determine numbers, concentration, and size, in order to understand and evaluate the potential risks related to human health.

        <p>However, the issue of MPs in products designated for human consumption received increasing attention in the last years due to the discovery of small MPs translocating to inner organs ( Deng et al., 2017 ). In the present study, MP abundance increased with decreasing size (until 20-40 μm), before decreasing to the smallest detectable size ( &lt; 10 μm). The latter aspect is a consequence of the low spectra quality (S/N ratio) when size decreases below 10 μm, resulting in fewer particles positively identified as a specific polymer and/or nonsysthetic particle. Pivokonsky et al. (2018) found MPs were the most abundant in the smallest detectable size class (1-10 μm), accounting for up to 95% of the total numbers. Also, Shruti et al. (2020) reported an increase in MPs with decreasing size, with 50% of MPs &lt; 500 μm. Unfortunately, the different methodologies applied in the previous study makes the comparison hardly feasible. The fact that we exclusively detected MPs between 8 and 374 μm, and that 32% of all detected MPs were smaller than 20 μm, may raise concern for human health. Investigations of MPs in fish and invertebrates suggest that MPs smaller than 500 μm might pass the gut wall ( Lusher et al., 2017 ), and MPs smaller than 20 μm can accumulate in liver, kidney and gut of mice ( Deng et al., 2017 ). However, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) classified the absorption of MPs larger than 150 μm as unlikely, and the absorption and uptake of MPs smaller than 20 μm (in total up to 0.3% for MPs &lt; 150 μm) into organs as overall limited ( EFSA, 2016 ). In order to put our results in perspective, approximately 97% of the MPs we detected were smaller than 150 μm in major dimension and MP numbers were on average 0.174 MPs/L. Considering a scenario with MP absorption of 0.3% and daily consumption of three litres potable water per day, the annual uptake would be of less than one MP particle per person through drinking potable water. Hence, to support a more robust human health risk assessment of MPs, future effort s need to be done to understand better the occurrence of plastic particles in potable water, their levels as number of particles and total masses, polymer type composition, size and shape. The latter features are of crucial importance for toxicologists to define exposure routes and tailor natural like exposure scenario to investigate realistic biological effects and define toxicity thresholds.However, the issue of MPs in products designated for human consumption received increasing attention in the last years due to the discovery of small MPs translocating to inner organs ( Deng et al., 2017 ).

        <p>This study represents a systematic and robust approach investigating MP quality, quantity, shape, and size, including very small MPs ( &lt; 20 μm), in drinking water. As such, it is an important step forward in understanding MP distribution and the potential implications for human health. Most detected MPs were smaller than 150 μm, and 32% were smaller than 20 μm, which could potentially pose a risk to human health. However, our results showed very low MP loads in drinking water processed in a high-performance drinking water treatment plant, suggesting a low risk to human health. For the first time, we investigated MP loads in drinking water using two complementary techniques, μFTIR imaging and Py-GCMS, and successfully determined very low MP loads in comparable concentrations.This study represents a systematic and robust approach investigating MP quality, quantity, shape, and size, including very small MPs ( &lt; 20 μm), in drinking water.
