        <p>Polyurethanes (PU) are a family of versatile synthetic polymers intended for diverse applications. Biological degradation of PU is a blooming research domain as it contributes to the design of ecofriendly materials sensitive to biodegradation phenomena and the development of green recycling processes. In this field, an increasing number of studies deal with the discovery and characterization of enzymes and microorganisms able to degrade PU chains. The synthesis of short lifespan PU material sensitive to biological degradation is also of growing interest. Measurement of PU degradation can be performed by a wide range of analytical tools depending on the architecture of the materials and the biological entities. Recent developments of these analytical techniques allowed for a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in PU biodegradation. Here, we reviewed the evaluation of biological PU degradation, including the required analytics. Advantages, drawbacks, specific uses, and results of these analytics are largely discussed to provide a critical overview and support future studies.Polyurethanes (PU) are a family of versatile synthetic polymers intended for diverse applications.

        <p>In 2019, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) published a list of ten emerging technologies in Chemistry with the potential to make our planet more sustainable. Among them, technologies permitting the transformation of plastic material into monomers are highlighted. These recycling technologies will help reduce plastic waste and save fossil resources. Despite comfort and incomparable uses to our everyday life, plastic materials are a cause of global and increasing pollution resulting from inadequate behaviors of both producers and users. The massive production involves a polluting exploitation of fossil resources and their poor waste management induces uncontrolled dissemination in the environment. In 2010, more than 275 million metric tons of plastic waste were generated in almost 200 coastal countries, out of which an estimated 5 to 13 million metric tons reached the oceans where plastic waste accumulate (Jambeck et al., 2015). With the problematic of the nano-or microplastic debris, ocean garbage patches are one of the major environmental concerns of this century (Cozar et al., 2014;Eriksen et al., 2013;Law et al., 2010). Even if some very minor studies still question the actual impact of plastic waste (Duis and Coors, 2016), most are warnings of irrevocable environmental damages (Clukey et al., 2018;Darmon et al., 2017;Galloway and Lewis, 2016). Furthermore, by entering the food chain, plastic materials finally attain human beings, thereby causing health concerns (Barboza et al., 2018;Bouwmeester et al., 2015;Chae and An, 2017).In 2019, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) published a list of ten emerging technologies in Chemistry with the potential to make our planet more sustainable.

        <p>Among the vast families of resistant plastic materials, we can find the polyurethanes (PUs). Lowdensity and easily dispersible foams (soft to rigid) represent around 70% of the PU production. The presence of PUs as pollutants in marine ecosystems has been largely attested (Frère et al., 2016;Reddy et al., 2006). In 2016, Turner et al. revealed that over the 70 foamed plastics fragments collected on a Britain beach, 39 were identified as PU (Figure 1), thus pointing out the significant role of PU in plastic pollution (Turner and Lau, 2016). (Turner and Lau, 2016) First synthesized in the 1930s by the German chemist Otto Bayer, PU products were commercialized about 10 years later (Bayer, 1948). The use of PU spread during World War II, where it replaced natural rubber for elastomer production. Rapidly, other applications emerged in aviation and textile, which were flourishing markets at the time. Diversification of PU properties allowed to reach other numerous markets. In 2016, 18 million tons of PU were produced worldwide, representing 5.3% of global plastic production (Furtwengler et al., 2018a;PlasticsEurope, 2017). PU rank at the 6 th most produced synthetic polymers. About 22 million tons are expected to be produced in 2020 (Akindoyo et al., 2016).Among the vast families of resistant plastic materials, we can find the polyurethanes (PUs).

        <p>In 2014, the PU foam market was valued at $46.8 billion and is expected to reach $72.2 billion by 2020 (Pillai et al., 2016). Flexible and rigid foams represent respectively 32% and 36% of the global PU production. Flexible foams, renowned for the comfort they provide, are used for the cushioning of furniture, bedding or automotive seats. In the construction area, rigid foams are preferred for thermal insulation and their use increases in agreement with a growing demand for energetically efficient buildings. PU are also widely used as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (CASE). PU coatings provide a protection layer against weather, abrasion and corrosion. Elastomers are both elastic and flexible and can adopt any desired shape, such as wheels for rollerblades. Biocompatibility of certain types of polyurethanes make them polymers of choice for medical application, for instance, cardiovascular devices or orthopedic prosthesis (Gunatillake et al., 2011;Zhou et al., 2012). The common thread between most of these PU materials is that they are mostly intended for long-term applications. They are mainly designed to resist environmental factors such as microbial degradation, abrasion, hydrolytic (moisture) or UV degradation.In 2014, the PU foam market was valued at $46.8 billion and is expected to reach $72.2 billion by 2020 (Pillai et al., 2016).

        <p>Biodegradation is generally defined as the decomposition/degradation of materials by the means of biological entities such as microorganisms or enzymes. This process is used for numerous industrial applications such as waste water treatment (Watanabe, 2001) or depollution of contaminated site by, for instance, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Shuttleworth and Cerniglia, 1995). Polymer degradation by microorganisms is performed through several steps (Figure 2). First, materials are fragmented into pieces thanks to abiotic and biotic factors such as UV, hydrolysis, abrasion or pressure exerted by filamentous microorganisms. Growth of filaments into polymer pores provokes cracks. Then, macromolecules are cleaved by enzymatic hydrolysis and/or oxidation, leading to the release of low molar mass molecules such as oligomers and monomers. These molecules are finally assimilated and mineralized by microorganisms to promote microbial growth (Lucas et al., 2008;Shah et al., 2008b). A countless number of mineralization paths exists in nature. The step of enzymatic depolymerization or enzymatic degradation can be reproduced or mimicked in vitro, independently of the microbial degradation. Interestingly, the released molecules resulting from enzymatic depolymerization of polymers could be turned into building blocks and high value products for the chemistry market (Wierckx et al., 2015). PU are not biodegradable polymers (Wierckx et al., 2018). Even if some PU are partly sensitive to biological degradation, they do not answer, for instance, the requirements of the European norm EN 13432 defining biodegradable and compostable materials (Avérous and Pollet, 2012;Bastioli, 2005). This norm considers a material as biodegradable if the degradation reaches 90% after 6 months, under composting conditions. The non-toxicity of the degradation products is also a requirement of this norm to declare a material as biodegradable or compostable. Biodegradation of PU has been studied since the 1960s. The first scientific publications on this topic aimed to evaluate the microbial degradation susceptibility of PU formulations to promote the development of highly resistant materials (Cooney, 1969;Darby and Kaplan, 1968;Edmonds and Cooney, 1968;Kanavel et al., 1966;Kaplan et al., 1968). Today, this approach is reversed to address the PU materials end-of-life issues. Due to increased environmental concerns, sensitivity to microbial degradation has become a desired feature to reduce the environmental footprint of PU materials, mainly at their ends of life (Prieto, 2016). Meanwhile, the development of bioresorbable PU materials for the biomedical industry raised interest (Pavlova and Draganova, 1993;Špírková et al., 2017). Currently, PU biodegradation assessments are focused on two main purposes: (i) biodegradation susceptibility of new eco-materials or materials intended for biomedical purposes, thus focusing on the polymer synthesis and (ii) bioremediation or biological recycling of PU, thus focusing on the biological entities capable of degradation.Biodegradation is generally defined as the decomposition/degradation of materials by the means of biological entities such as microorganisms or enzymes.

        <p>3. Polyurethane structure and biological degradation susceptibility relationships 3.1. Diversity of the compositions and architectures of PU Chemical composition and macromolecular architectures are of prime importance for the biodegradation of polymers (Kim and Kim, 1998). The nature of chemical bonds, crystallinity and molar mass are key parameters influencing the polymer susceptibility to biological attacks (Zeng et al., 2016). PUs are characterized by the urethane or carbamate linkage, generally obtained by addition of an isocyanate to a hydroxyl group (Figure 3). For instance, in thermoplastic PU (TPU) synthesis, an excess of polyisocyanate reacts with a polyol, principally long polyester-or polyether-based polyols, with a controlled functionality close to 2. A linear prepolymer with isocyanate end groups is formed, followed by addition of a chain extender, usually a short diol, obtain high molar mass polymers. Molar mass is a parameter influencing the biological degradation susceptibility of polymers. It has been shown that for polymers with the same chemical structures and different molar mass, the higher the molar mass, the lower the biological degradation susceptibility (Philip et al., 2007;Zheng et al., 2005). The most frequently used isocyanates are bifunctional aromatic molecules such as 4,4'-methylene diphenyl isocyanate (4,4'-MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (2,4-TDI) that give, respectively, a rigid and a more flexible polymer backbone (Table 1) (Delebecq et al., 2013). Due to its chemical structure presenting two aromatic rings, MDI is the most used isocyanate for rigid foams, one of the most prevalent PU-based product (Sabbioni et al., 2012). Aliphatic isocyanates are also of interest such as isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), lysine diisocyanate (LDI) or 4,4'-methylene dicyclohexyl diisocyanate (H12MDI) (Table 1). They are preferred for medical devices because of the mutagenicity of diamines derived from aromatic diisocyanate hydrolysis (Darby et al., 1978). For the preparation of waterborne polyurethane dispersion, aliphatic isocyanates are chosen due to the high reactivity of aromatic isocyanates with water, making aromatic isocyanates hard to handle in these particular formulations (Noble, 1997). Finally, in the frame of sustainable PUs development, non-isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) is of growing interest. Indeed, isocyanates derived from phosgene are extremely toxic. NIPU can be obtained by reaction between amines and cyclic carbonates to form polyhydroxy-urethanes, rendering the process of PU synthesis more environment-friendly (Carré et al., 2014;Carré et al., 2015).The high reactivity of isocyanates makes them unstable in water. Consequently, even if free isocyanates remain entrapped in the polymer after its synthesis, they will immediately react with water molecules from the aqueous media. Therefore, no isocyanates can be found either before or after degradation. Common polyols are polyether, polyester or, more rarely, polycarbonates. Higher flexibility of polyether polyols makes them more convenient for polyurethane production (Krasowska et al., 2012). A non-exhaustive list of polyols with their structures is available in Table 2. Polyols ordinarily used are fossil-based molecules, but an increasing number of studies deal with bio-based polyols, on agreement with green chemistry principles. Polyols from vegetal sources such as castor oil (Hablot et al., 2008;Trovati et al., 2010), starch (Duarah et al., 2016) or aromatic biopolymers such as tannins or lignin (Ignat et al., 2011;Laurichesse et al., 2014) are increasingly incorporated in PU formulations. Based on short diols such as 1,4-butanediol, ethylene glycol or 1,6-hexanediol, (Akindoyo et al., 2016) chain extenders are used to obtain highmolar mass polymers. Low molar mass diamines can also be used, such as ethylene diamine (Tang et al., 1997), thus generating urea instead of urethane bonds. et al., 2004) 1783.

        <p>PUs can be thermoplastics or thermosets. Thermoplastics are linear or slightly crosslinked/branched structures. Isocyanates, polyols and chain extenders used for TPU synthesis have only two functional groups (diols or diisocyanates). Thermoplastics can be soluble in organic solvent and can be melted, or present a liquid-like behavior with increased temperature. TPUs are commonly described by two types of segments, hard and soft segments. The segments are generally organized with a specific micro-segregation which can lead to micro-crystalline phases.PUs can be thermoplastics or thermosets.

        <p>The hard segment (HS) is a block segment with low mobility mainly formed by the isocyanate and the short-chain extender. By contrast, the soft segment (SS) is mainly based on the long polyol part (Figure 4a). TPUs are often semi-crystalline structures (Figure 4b). HS content and chemistry influenced the biodegradation susceptibility of a polycarbonate PU (Tang et al., 2001a, b).The hard segment (HS) is a block segment with low mobility mainly formed by the isocyanate and the short-chain extender.

        <p>Interactions between enzymes and mobile SS are higher than with the HS. Consequently, the higher the HS content, the lower the biological degradation susceptibility. Thermosets are highly cross-linked polymers with 3D structures brought by molecules with a functionality higher than 2. Due to their architecture, thermosets are not soluble, do not melt and are denatured at high temperature, and thus cannot be reshaped by heating, unlike thermoplastics. PU foams are thermoset materials. The alveolar structures of these complex and multicomponent systems are obtained thanks to physical or chemical blowing with air, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons such as isopentane or other gaseous substances. Foams are structured by struts and walls defining cell cavities. Cells can be closed (closed-cell foams, mainly rigid e.g. thermal insulation) or open (open-cell foams, mainly soft e.g. damping) (Gautam et al., 2007a). Side reactions during foaming induce the formation of various reversible and irreversible bonds such as urea or isocyanurate moieties (Furtwengler and Avérous, 2018). Isocyanurate linkage is obtained by isocyanate trimerization. Polyisocyanurate foams are increasingly produced because of their better properties such as fire resistance and thermal stability (Arbenz et al., 2016;Furtwengler et al., 2018b). It is then important to consider the bond nature when dealing with foam degradation. Because of the variety of bonds, it is difficult to anticipate and know if the urethane bond was degraded. Also, commercial foams are supplemented with several additives such as fire retardants, antioxidant, processing aids, and anti-microbial compounds (mainly fungicides) that can prevent biodegradation.Interactions between enzymes and mobile SS are higher than with the HS.

        <p>Due to the nanometric size of the particles and their hydrophilicity, waterborne PU dispersions (WPUDs) are particularly suitable for biological assays (Figure 5a). To provide hydrophilicity, WPUDs are synthesized using an emulsifier, often the 2,2-dimethylol propionic acid. This molecule contains two hydroxyl groups which react with the isocyanates to form urethane linkage (Figure 5b). The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid does not react with isocyanate because of steric hindrance and the lower reactivity (Coutinho et al., 2001). Hydrophilic carboxylic acid then forms a stabilizing top-layer around the hydrophobic polymer (Zhang et al., 2011). Systems containing acrylic polyols are readily dispersed in water (Ionescu, 2005). Acrylic polyols are thus widely used in WPUD formulations. These polyols provide strength and resistance to coatings (Akindoyo et al., 2016). Acrylic polyols are generally based on hydroxyethyl methacrylate or hydroxyethyl acrylate (Figure 5c). The hydroxyl groups of the lateral chains then react with isocyanate for urethane formation.Due to the nanometric size of the particles and their hydrophilicity, waterborne PU dispersions (WPUDs) are particularly suitable for biological assays (Figure 5a). To provide hydrophilicity, WPUDs are synthesized using an emulsifier, often the 2,2-dimethylol propionic acid. This molecule contains two hydroxyl groups which react with the isocyanates to form urethane linkage (Figure 5b).

        <p>The diversity of PUs macromolecular structures and chemistry is a clear obstacle for efficient waste management. To appreciate the importance of PU biodegradation, it is necessary to analyze the current PU waste disposal. PU waste is made of post-consumer products as well as PU production waste, mostly from foam. Indeed, scrap from slabstock foam can reach up to 10% of the production (Simon et al., 2018). In France, scrap PUs were estimated at 13 kTons in 2011 while end-of-life PU volume is about 198 kTons (Boujard et al., 2014). This source of PU waste mainly arises from construction, furniture, bedding, automotive, shoes and home appliances. Efficient collection and product dismantling are required to recycle these materials, thus limiting their valorization.The diversity of PUs macromolecular structures and chemistry is a clear obstacle for efficient waste management.

        <p>PU wastes are mainly treated by three different methods: landfilling, incineration (which can also be considered as quaternary recycling (Ignatyev et al., 2014)) and conventional recycling. Landfill discharge is often the main option but is gradually decreasing, especially in Europe, since it requires large land areas and no value is brought from the waste. European Union aims at reducing municipal waste landfilling to a maximum of 10% by 2030 (Castillo-Gimenez et al., 2019;Makarichi et al., 2018). Landfilling and the absence of waste management lead generally to pollution (Jambeck et al., 2015).PU wastes are mainly treated by three different methods: landfilling, incineration (which can also be considered as quaternary recycling (Ignatyev et al., 2014)) and conventional recycling.

        <p>Incineration presents the advantage of being a mature technique, practiced for several decades. Energy is recovered by burning waste and can totally or partly offset the energy spent in the heating process. Even if some CO2 emission exists and may cause greenhouse effect and contribute to global warming, new generations of plants are equipped with dry and wet air pollution control system to make this process as clean as possible (Brunner and Rechberger, 2015;Makarichi et al., 2018). Because of the low value recovered it is hardly considered as recycling. It is a proper solution to reduce landfill volumes, yet incineration is not a satisfying strategy since the richness from the chemical architecture is fully lost.Incineration presents the advantage of being a mature technique, practiced for several decades.

        <p>Depending on the nature (thermoplastics vs. thermosets), recycling processes differ. TPUs can be heated and remolded therefore making the physical recycling process easier. However, it is estimated that only 1% of PU are recycled thanks to physical methods (Behrendt and Naber, 2009). The recycling of PU foams is more challenging since foams cannot be remolded. The main path for foam recycling is regrinding. In 2002, more than 380 kTons were used for carpet underlay (Zia et al., 2007).Depending on the nature (thermoplastics vs. thermosets), recycling processes differ.

        <p>Chemical recycling can address both thermoplastic and thermoset architectures (Simón et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2011). Glycolysis appears as the most promising technique (Simon et al., 2018). Glycolysis is a transesterification reaction. The ester group of the urethane bond is interchanged by the hydroxyl group of a diol (glycol) added in large excess (Simón et al., 2013). Simón et al., developed a glycolysis process allowing polyether polyol recovery from high resilience PU foams (Simón et al., 2016). These polyols can then serve as building blocks for the synthesis of secondgeneration polymers. The major limits of chemical recycling are the processing temperature that leads to high energy consumption (in the example mentioned above, the glycolysis temperature is 190°C) and the side chemical reactions occurring on the urethane bond during the chemical reactions (Gadhave et al., 2019).Chemical recycling can address both thermoplastic and thermoset architectures (Simón et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2011).

        <p>Biological recycling is a growing route with high potential that might answer the need for PU recycling in the coming years. This is a soft process that can be implemented at low temperatures (less than 70°C) (Mueller, 2006;Valerio, 2010). This process is catalyzed by biological entities, namely enzymes. The resulting degradation products may then be valorized. Efficient enzymatic depolymerization of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has been demonstrated at 60°C leading to the release of valuable building blocks such as terephthalic acid and mono(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (Gamerith et al., 2017). This result, based on PET, can be considered as the first benchmark for PU. For instance, the company Carbios (France) is starting the biological recycling of PET for the synthesis of second-generation polymers.Biological recycling is a growing route with high potential that might answer the need for PU recycling in the coming years.

        <p>Biodegradation involving microorganisms can be performed by a microbial community or a single strain (Figure 6). Microorganisms can form biofilms on the polymer surface by adhesion (Sivan, 2011).

        <p>A microbial community is a group of microorganisms sharing a common living place. These microorganisms interact in different ways such as mutualism, predation or competition (Faust and Raes, 2012). Mutualism, also called symbiosis, may occur during the microbial degradation of xenobiotic, such as synthetic polymers, leading to an improved degradation (Tsoi et al., 2019;Vaclavkova et al., 2007). Comparison of degradation skills of a strain of fungi (Aspergillus niger) and a strain of bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) revealed a slightly higher TPU degradation with the bacteria but, above all, an impressive synergistic effect was observed when the polymer was incubated with both strains (Fernandes et al., 2016). Weight losses were approximately doubled for polyester TPU incubated with both microorganisms compared to single strain incubation. PU substrates degraded by communities range from simple structures such as thermoplastic polyester PU (Genovese et al., 2016) to recalcitrant material such as polyether PU foam (Ge et al., 2000). As PU are recalcitrant material, degradation experiments by microbial communities are often performed on a long time scale going from 28 days (Bentham et al., 1987) to two years of incubation (Seal and Pantke, 1988). The predominant systems for studying PU degradation have been composting and soil burial (Table 3 -PU degradation by microbial communities and associated PU substrates. These ecosystems are rich in degrading microorganisms. Other strategies to obtain communities that are more acclimated to PU are also developed. For instance, Cregut et al., selected microbial communities from the soil of a PU foam industrial plant (Cregut et al., 2014).

        <p>Single species of bacteria and fungi can be isolated and identified using molecular tools. These isolated strains are then used alone for PU degradation assays (Khan et al., 2017;Nair and Kumar, 2007). Another approach is to establish a collection of microorganisms and to screen it for the identification of PU-degrading strain. For instance, Russell et al. collected endophytic fungi from wood of the Ecuadorian Amazonian rainforest (Russell et al., 2011). Equatorial are hot and humid environments, and above-all, well-known for the tremendous richness of their biodiversity.

Only a few studies are based on this norm and mentioned these strains. However, using such reference fungal strains would allow better reproducibility and comparison of results in-between studies.</p>
        <p>A review on the biodegradation of fossil-based polymers interestingly shows the significant importance of the abiotic effect of fungal biodegradation (Lucas et al., 2008). The formation of filaments exerts physical pressure leading to polymer breaking. Filament apices penetrate in the material increasing the size of pores and provoking cracks. For instance, rifts under the form of a fungal filament network were observed by microscopy on the surface of a TPU incubated two months with a strain of Penicillium brasilianum (Magnin et al., 2018). Fungal degradation has been demonstrated on both polyester-and polyether-based PU, on TPU, foams and coatings. However, mechanisms of degradation have not been fully elucidated. The importance of each biotic and abiotic steps in fungal degradation still needs to be clarified.A review on the biodegradation of fossil-based polymers interestingly shows the significant importance of the abiotic effect of fungal biodegradation (Lucas et al., 2008).

All the other assays dealing with enzymatic degradation of PU relies on hydrolytic enzymes (EC 3). Several hydrolytic mechanisms have indeed been highlighted for PU degradation. The most common is the hydrolysis of the polyester moieties of polyesterbased PU by esterases (EC 3.1). Ester hydrolysis leads to the release of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol (Figure 7a). Other esterases such as lipases (EC 3.1.1) (Fang et al., 2014;Schöne et al., 2016), cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) (Schmidt, J. et al., 2017;Yang et al., 2013) or unspecific esterases (EC 3.1) (Kang et al., 2011) have been described as polyester PU degrading enzymes. Esterase has also been described as hydrolyzing the urethane linkage. Some of these studies refer to a mechanism resulting in carbamic acid and alcohol chain-ends after hydrolysis (Mahajan and Gupta, 2015;Wei and Zimmermann, 2017). However, this mechanism does not seem conceivable because of the instability of the carbamic acid which immediately breaks down into an amine with the release of a molecule of carbon dioxide (Ionescu, 2005;Ozaki, 1972) (Figure 7b). Moreover, most of the assays involving esterases concern polyester-based PU and do not allow differentiation between ester and urethane bond hydrolysis. To evaluate the urethane bond hydrolysis by an esterase, assays must be performed on substrates that do not contain ester bonds. Publications describing slight esterase activity on polyether PU and showing the potential ability of esterase to hydrolyze the urethane bond are scarce (Santerre et al., 1994;Smith et al., 1987). A cholesterol lipase was reported to display activity on a PU based on triethylene glycol and 1,4-di-S-benzyl-D,L-dithiothreitol (Ferris et al., 2010). Urease (EC 3.5.1.5) also showed activity on poly(ether urea) PU (Phua et al., 1987) but the degradation is mainly attributed to the urea bond hydrolysis (Figure 7c). Amidases (EC 3.5.1.4) and proteases hydrolyze amide or peptidic bonds leading to the release of a carboxylic acid and an amine (Figure 7d). These enzymes appeared to be also efficient for the hydrolysis of the urethane bond leading to the release of an amine, an alcohol and a carbon dioxide molecule (Figure 7e). Proteases such as papain (EC 3.4.22.2) (Campinez et al., 2013;Ferris et al., 2010;Marchant et al., 1987;Yamamoto et al., 2007), bromelain (EC 3.4.22.32/33) (Yamamoto et al., 2007), ficain (EC 3.4.22.3) (Yamamoto et al., 2007) and chymotrypsin EC 3.4.21.1 (Ciardelli et al., 2004;Elliott et al., 2002;Ferris et al., 2010) are also described for the degradation of PU. Recently, an amidase drew attention. This enzyme was isolated from Nocardia farcinica with the specificity of being able to hydrolyze polyamides (Guo et al., 2014) but also both the ester and amide bonds of non-water soluble model substrates (Heumann et al., 2009) and polyester-based PUs (Gamerith et al., 2016).

        <p>Corresponding product analysis showed that hydrolysis of ester moieties from the SS by the esterase released low molar mass molecules containing urethane bonds that are then hydrolyzed by the amidase (Magnin et al., 2019). Another strategy for enzymatic depolymerization improvement is to use protein engineering. This approach already proved itself on PET-degrading enzymes. As an example, decreased inhibitor sensitivity of a PET-degrading cutinase has been successfully achieved by amino-acid modification into the catalytic site (Wei et al., 2016). Thermostability is also a key parameter for polymer degradation (Kawai et al., 2014). Ribitsch et al., fused a PET-degrading enzyme (a cutinase from Thermomyces cellullosylitica) with a binding module of a PHA depolymerase from Alcaligenes faecalis (Ribitsch et al., 2013) to improve enzyme/polymer interactions. This binding domain was recently added to the amidase from Nocardia farcinica to improve the degradation of polyester PU pellets (Gamerith et al., 2016). These improvements will help reaching efficient depolymerization processes for PU biorecycling.Corresponding product analysis showed that hydrolysis of ester moieties from the SS by the esterase released low molar mass molecules containing urethane bonds that are then hydrolyzed by the amidase (Magnin et al., 2019).

Low molar mass molecules containing a single urethane linkage can be designed for this purpose. Urethane-based molecules are not soluble in water.

        <p>Low molar mass N-tolylcarbamate molecules correspond to toluene with urethane linkage on one or two carbons of the aromatic ring bound to ethanol moieties (Owen et al., 1996). In Owen et al., aromatic amines resulting from the N-tolylcarbamate hydrolysis were extracted in chloroform and quantified by Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). This assay revealed that the degrading activity of the Exophiala jeanselmei strain REN-11A depends on the position of the urethane(s) around the aromatic ring. Toluene-2,4-and -2,6-dicarbamic acid diethyl ester were the most readily biodegradable molecules (Figure 8). These compounds were degraded by both Rhodococcus equi strain TB-60 and a purified urethanedegrading enzyme secreted by this bacterium. Degradation products were extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by GC/MS except for the HDI-based model molecules which degradation products were extracted with toluene under alkaline conditions. Because of the difficulties to detect aliphatic amines in GC/MS, amines coming from HDI-based molecules hydrolysis were derivatized using heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride following the method of Skarping et al.

        <p>Coupling a 96-wells microplate assay with HPLC analysis was proposed for the development of a medium-throughput screening (Magnin et al., 2019). A model molecule based on p-Toluenesulfonyl isocyanate was synthesized for this microplate assay (Figure 9). Both the substrate and the degradation products were analyzed by HPLC. Finally, 55 enzymes were screened resulting in the identification of two amidases able to hydrolyze the urethane bond.

Molecules based on this aromatic compound are well known as model substrates for enzymes such as esterase (4-nitrophenyl acetate) or amidase (4-nitroacetanilide). 1-methoxypropan-2-yl (4nitrophenyl) carbamate was synthesized (Figure 10) and the subsequent hydrolysis leads to the release of 4-nitroaniline that can be tracked and quantified by UV-vis absorbance measurements at 405 nm.Coupling a 96-wells microplate assay with HPLC analysis was proposed for the development of a medium-throughput screening (Magnin et al., 2019).

        <p>WPUD are particularly suitable to assess the degradation ability of enzymes and microorganisms thanks to the polymer particles nanometric size and homogeneity in water. Indeed, their specific surface is higher than for previously described polymers, thus maximizing interactions between the degrading entity and the polymer. Moreover, all biodegradation reactions occur in aqueous media. The most famous WPUD is the Impranil-DLN®, commercialized by Covestro (Germany) for textile coating applications. Particle size is estimated to range between 0.1 to 0.2 µm (Biffinger et al., 2015). This dispersion appears as a white, milky suspension containing 40% of polymer. The exact composition and structure of Impranil-DLN® are not precisely known. A tentative structure has been proposed by Biffinger et al. based on polyhexane/neopentyl adipate polyester and HDI (Figure 11). Diethylene glycol is also a component of Impranil-DLN® (Gautam et al., 2007b).WPUD are particularly suitable to assess the degradation ability of enzymes and microorganisms thanks to the polymer particles nanometric size and homogeneity in water.

        <p>Figure 11 -Impranil-DLN® tentative structure adapted from Biffinger et al., 2015(Biffinger et al., 2015) Impranil-DLN® has been widely studied as a PU-based model since it presents the particularity to become translucent when hydrolyzed as a result of water-soluble molecules being released in the medium. Impranil-DLN® was used as "polyurethane biodegradation benchmark" for the first time in 1994 (Crabbe et al., 1994). Screening of soil fungi was performed on a plate where Impranil-DLN® was mixed with an agar medium. Fungi were allowed to grow on it and a transparent halo appeared after a few days when the microorganism was producing degrading enzymes. This agar plate technique has subsequently been used intensively (Howard et al., 2001;Peng et al., 2014;Rowe and Howard, 2002;Vega et al., 1999) (Figure 12a &amp; b). Impranil-DLN® is also suitable for assays in liquid media for both microorganisms (Álvarez-Barragán et al., 2016;Russell et al., 2011) (Figure 12c) and enzymes (Gautam et al., 2007b;Schmidt, J. et al., 2017). (Russell et al., 2011) As the exact polymer structure is unknown, it is difficult to appraise the mechanism of degradation. Biffinger et al., used NMR and FT-IR to offer quantitative analysis of alcohol and carboxylic acid release after the ester bond cleavage (Biffinger et al., 2015). They also highlighted that polymer aggregation can occur when incubated with enzymes without any measurable degradation. Observation of the polymer is thus not sufficient to conclude on enzymatic degradation activity. Ufarté et al., proposed to use Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation -Time of Flight/Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) to identify degradation by-products. Three peaks at m/z 682, 683 and 782 were specific of the bacterial degradation of Impranil-DLN®. All seemed to correspond to the formula C36H68O8N2, ionized with either Na + or I -. The peak at m/z 683 could correspond to the isotope form of the molecule at m/z 682. However, no specific chemical structure has been suggested. Alvarez-Barragan et al., presented the analysis of degradation by-products by GC/MS (Álvarez-Barragán et al., 2016). Almost none of the products identified correspond to the Impranil putative structure shown above (Figure 11) suggesting that the structure is much more complex than expected. The only corresponding molecule is HDI. However, HDI cannot be a degradation product as isocyanates are not stable in water. A possible explanation would be the detection of either hexane diamine (HDA) or HDI-derivatives.Figure 11 -Impranil-DLN® tentative structure adapted from Biffinger et al., 2015(Biffinger et al., 2015) Impranil-DLN® has been widely studied as a PU-based model since it presents the particularity to become translucent when hydrolyzed as a result of water-soluble molecules being released in the medium.

        <p>Despite some important limitations, Impranil-DLN® is thus a good model substrate to identify degrading entities that have a great chance to be efficient afterwards on polyester PUs. It provides a first approach that must then be confirmed. Hung et al. (2016) did not only present Impranil-DLN® as a model but also as a common coating which integrity can be affected by microbial degradation (Hung et al., 2016). Esterase and lipase are mainly involved in the enzymatic degradation of Impranil-DLN®. However, up to now, there is no clear evidence that these enzymes, improperly called "Polyurethanase" (Ruiz et al., 1999;Stern and Howard, 2000), effectively hydrolyze the urethane bond.Despite some important limitations, Impranil-DLN® is thus a good model substrate to identify degrading entities that have a great chance to be efficient afterwards on polyester PUs.

        <p>The most mainstream PU systems, i.e. TPU and PU foams, have been tested in biodegradation assays. These products present a wide and varied range of chemical structures and groups. When the purpose is to evaluate the susceptibility to biological degradation of a material, the structure and formulation are precisely described in the study. In contrast, bioremediation and biological recycling studies on PU mainly involve commercial products of complex and often unknown chemical structure, additives and composition. The biological degradation experiments described in the literature are mainly partial, leading to the recovery of the degraded polymer and, possibly, soluble degradation products released in the aqueous media (Figure 13).

        <p>PUs shape drives the specific surface and thus the bioavailability which is of importance for the biological degradation. Thanks to their alveolar structure, bioavailability is greater for foams, especially for open-cell foams, as microorganisms can easily circulate inside the material. Foams can also be ground to increase bioavailability (Cregut et al., 2014). TPUs for degradation assays can be used as thin films obtained by coating after solubilizing in an appropriate solvent, pouring on glassware and solvent evaporation (Chen et al., 2016;Woo et al., 2000). Thin films obtained can reach a few dozen micrometers (Phua et al., 1987). TPU films can also be obtained by thermoforming (Zhou and Xie, 2017). TPU cubes (Nakajima-Kambe et al., 1995), pellets (Cosgrove et al., 2007) or sheets (Ibrahim N. Ibrahim, 2009) are also used for PU degradation assays.PUs shape drives the specific surface and thus the bioavailability which is of importance for the biological degradation.

        <p>It is not recommended to sterilize TPUs by autoclaving for microbial experiments as most of the TPU becomes liquid-like or very soft at autoclaving temperatures (121°C). Degradation can occur e.g., a study comparing autoclaved and non-autoclaved poly(ether urea) PU material revealed that no weight loss was observed after autoclaving but a surface alteration appeared, leading to bias in degradation measurement (Rafiemanzelat et al., 2015). Alternatives such as rinsing with ethanol (Cosgrove et al., 2010;Mathur and Prasad, 2012), UV exposure (Gogoi and Karak, 2014) or both (Osman et al., 2018) are thus frequently employed to sterilize the samples. Because of better thermal resistance of thermosetting materials, foams can be tested after autoclaving (Álvarez-Barragán et al., 2016).It is not recommended to sterilize TPUs by autoclaving for microbial experiments as most of the TPU becomes liquid-like or very soft at autoclaving temperatures (121°C).

        <p>The most widespread method to evaluate global biodegradation is the weight loss of the PU. Samples are weighted before and after degradation assay to evaluate the weight of degradation products released in the liquid media. It is a straightforward and easy method to implement, although some bias can be noticed. For instance, if the degradation is too superficial and too low to lead to detectable product release, the test will be considered as inefficient as no weight loss will be measured. Therefore, weight loss measurement must be associated with a surface analysis of the sample (Rafiemanzelat et al., 2015) in case of a low degradation extent, or to analyze the early steps of the degradation. It is necessary to remove all the biological materials that can remain on the polymer surface. Hard washing with ethanol is generally performed (Mathur and Prasad, 2012;Urgun-Demirtas et al., 2007). Non-ionic surfactants such as TritonX-100 (Polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether) (1% v/v) have also been suggested to remove reversibly bounded enzymes and cells (Ciardelli et al., 2004). This cleaning step is particularly challenging for the fungal degradation of foams as filaments could be deeply trapped into the bulk structure of the samples. It was recently suggested to use 0.88% (wt/vol) sodium hypochlorite for 18 h to destroy and remove the remaining mycelium (Álvarez-Barragán et al., 2016). When enzymatic degradations are performed, kinetic weight loss is generally set up (Dogan et al., 2017;Zhou and Xie, 2017). In such experiments, a loss of enzymatic activity is often observed with time. This loss of activity may be due to the thermal denaturation of enzymes (Pastorino et al., 2004) or to the release of inhibiting compounds (Barth et al., 2015). To cope with this phenomenon, enzymatic solutions are frequently renewed at regular time intervals (Phua et al., 1987). Between the removal step and the renewal step, polymer pieces are usually washed, dried and weighed.The most widespread method to evaluate global biodegradation is the weight loss of the PU.

        <p>As a parameter of global assay efficiency, the evaluation of the ability of a microorganism to grow on PUs when the polymer is used as the sole source of carbon (or carbon and nitrogen) is common practice (Cooney, 1969). Indeed, microbial development means that microorganisms can depolymerize PUs and metabolize degradation products for growth. It is possible to quantitatively follow the bacterial growth through the McFarland method which estimates the number of bacteria thanks to turbidity measurement using UV-vis at 600 nm (Bayan and Karak, 2017;Fernandes et al., 2016;Gogoi and Karak, 2014). Colony forming unit (CFU) is another method to count bacteria: after being incubated with polymers, bacteria are sampled, diluted and poured on an agar plate containing a rich medium (Crookes-Goodson et al., 2013;Urgun-Demirtas et al., 2007). Colonies are counted after overnight incubation. The dry or wet weight of the biomass corresponding to microorganisms growth can be measured (Oceguera-Cervantes et al., 2007). This technique could be particularly suitable for bacteria that form aggregates or for filamentous fungi.As a parameter of global assay efficiency, the evaluation of the ability of a microorganism to grow on PUs when the polymer is used as the sole source of carbon (or carbon and nitrogen) is common practice (Cooney, 1969).

        <p>Mineralization of polymers by microorganisms in aerobic conditions leads to the production of CO2 with O2 consumption. Online sensors are used to measure both evolutions. These variations must be compared to a negative control made without polymers (Cregut et al., 2014) or with an inert polymer such as low-density polyethylene (Rattanapan et al., 2016), and to a conventional biodegradable positive control such as cellulose (Gómez et al., 2014) or sodium benzoate (Rattanapan et al., 2016) incubated with the same inoculum. For instance, low O2 consumption and CO2 release were measured during the 28 days of degradation of a ground polyether PU foam revealing low degradation by an acclimated microbial consortium (Cregut et al., 2014). CO2 release during PU mineralization is associated with pressure increase. The pressure can be measured by a Sturm test (Standard OECD 301 B) (Shah et al., 2016). This test is used for readily biodegradable materials and usually lasts 28 days. Rattanapan et al., used this assay to measure the biodegradation of a biobased polyester PU foam with long incubation time (60 days) (Rattanapan et al., 2016). In fact, after 30 days, 7 to 11% of degradation was measured while a higher degradation rate occurred during the last 30 days leading to a maximal degradation yield of 46 wt%. Under anaerobic digestion, CH4 is produced proportionally to polymer consumption. Gomez et al., proposed to compare the biological degradation susceptibility of polyether PU foams under composting, soil burial and anaerobic digestion according to three ASTM standard methods based on CO2 or CH4 measurement (Gómez et al., 2014) (International, 2003a) and the ASTM D5511-02 (Standard test method for determining anaerobic biodegradation of plastic materials under highsolid anaerobic-digestion conditions) (International, 2002). The most pronounced degradation was observed for a bio-based PU foam after 320 days of soil burial. Methods involving CO2, O2 or CH4 measurement present a low throughput. Incubation time is superior to 28 days. Moreover, a pressure or gas monitor is required for each reaction which is generally performed in flasks from 2 to 5 liters (recommendation for OECD 301 series). These methods are mainly oriented towards the evaluation of the biological sensitivity or resistance of newly synthesized or commercial PUs, especially foams. These techniques are not suitable for screening of PU degrading entities.Mineralization of polymers by microorganisms in aerobic conditions leads to the production of CO2 with O2 consumption.

Moreover, a pressure or gas monitor is required for each reaction which is generally performed in flasks from 2 to 5 liters (recommendation for OECD 301 series). These methods are mainly oriented towards the evaluation of the biological sensitivity or resistance of newly synthesized or commercial PUs, especially foams. These techniques are not suitable for screening of PU degrading entities.</p>
        <p>The first assessment of polymer degradation is a naked eye observation, sometimes sufficient to evaluate the degradation onset. Change in color, roughness or shape can be noticed (Pilch-Pitera, 2012). These observations can be completed by surface analysis such as spectroscopy and/or microscopy, polymer molar mass evolution by SEC or modifications of physical properties.The first assessment of polymer degradation is a naked eye observation, sometimes sufficient to evaluate the degradation onset.

        <p>FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) analysis relies on the fact that most molecules absorb in the infrared region. This absorption corresponds specifically to the vibration modes of the different bonds present in the analytes. Absorption spectra thus provide information on the chemical structure of the polymer as a fingerprint. FT-IR is particularly popular for PU degradation analysis because of its accuracy and rapidity and because FT-IR is a non-destructive method: the sample is recovered without damage after the analysis. Surface analysis can be easily performed to measure superficial biological degradation. Different issues can be encountered in the analysis and interpretation of a spectrum. For instance, partial similarities between bonds e.g., urethane and ester groups complicate the spectra interpretation for polyester PUs. Moreover, both hydroxyl (OH) moieties, resulting from ester and urethane degradation, and amine (NH) moieties, resulting from urethane degradation, absorb around 3400 cm -1 . For polyester PUs, the increase of this large band is generally attributed to ester-or both ester and urethane hydrolysis (Oprea, 2010;Spontón et al., 2013), but it has also already been interpreted exclusively as the cleavage of the urethane bond (Umare and Chandure, 2008).FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) analysis relies on the fact that most molecules absorb in the infrared region.

        <p>Similarly, it is difficult to interpret changes in spectra presenting carbonyl bonds (C=O) that appear in ester (1750-1725 cm -1 ), urethane (1700 cm -1 ) and urea bonds (1630 cm -1 ). In polyester PUs, there is often a unique broad signal representing both urethane and ester carbonyl bonds. Its decrease is generally attributed to ester bond hydrolysis (Schmidt, J. et al., 2017;Shah et al., 2016) but sometimes has been attributed only to urethane bond hydrolysis in polyester PUs (Gómez et al., 2014;Ozsagiroglu et al., 2012). The signal at 1530 cm -1 is generally attributed to the nitrogen of the urethane moieties. A comparison of the polyester PU based on PCL and the constitutive PCL polyester showed that the signal at 1530 cm -1 only appeared on the PU spectrum thus confirming that this signal is attributed to the urethane (Magnin et al., 2019). Oprea et al. suggested that an increase of this signal is related to urethane bond hydrolysis (Oprea, 2010) while others suggested that a decrease of this signal attests to urethane bond degradation (Oceguera-Cervantes et al., 2007;Sarkar and Lopina, 2007). It is also conceivable that an increase of this signal is correlated to the increase of the urethane proportion in the polymer after the biological hydrolysis of the soft segment. Concluding on the variation of this signal upon degradation appeared therefore complicated. Other peaks are sometimes considered as proof of PU degradation. For instance, the emergence of a peak at 2250 cm -1 after degradation has been attributed to isocyanate (NCO) release (Shah et al., 2016) (Figure 14b). However, isocyanates are unstable in water and cannot be released through biological degradation in aqueous media. This signal could correspond to atmospheric CO2 resulting from improperly done FT-IR background spectra (Gerakines et al., 1994). Since high variation on FT-IR spectra interpretations are observed through the literature, especially concerning polyester PUs, additional methods must be used to confirm urethane bond cleavage for PU degradation. Kay et al., suggested to consider the decrease of the ratio ester (C=O) /ether (1720 cm -1 /1125 cm - 1 ), the ratio urethane (NH)/ether (1630 cm -1 /1125cm -1 ) and the ratio aryl (C=C)/ether in order to provide a semi-quantitative analysis of the degradation of a polyether PU (Kay et al., 1993). The ratio ester/ether decreases after degradation with a strain of Corynebacterium while the ratio urethane/ether and aryl/ether remain stable meaning that the ester bonds are affected by the bacterial degradation. Zhang et al., have used the band at 1463 cm -1 corresponding to CH2 moieties to normalize their results (Zhang et al., 1994). The decrease of the normalized signals of 1239 cm -1 /1463 cm -1 revealed an alteration of the polyester part of an arterial prosthesis made in polyester PU after 100 days of incubation with pancreatin and collagenase. However, no change of the normalized signal of 1695cm -1 /1463cm -1 showed the stability of the urethane moieties.Similarly, it is difficult to interpret changes in spectra presenting carbonyl bonds (C=O) that appear in ester (1750-1725 cm -1 ), urethane (1700 cm -1 ) and urea bonds (1630 cm -1 ).

SEM allows for a qualitative evaluation of the degradation on the surface after biological treatment by observation of cracks or holes on the degraded polymers. Enzymatic degradation generally leads to cracks (Figure 14a) or holes (Figure 14b) homogeneously spread at the TPU surface (Ozsagiroglu et al., 2012;Schmidt, J. et al., 2017) while degradation with a microbial consortium leads to irregularities (Figure 14c) (Das et al., 2017;Thirunavukarasu et al., 2015;Zafar et al., 2013). For instance, Das et al., showed the appearance of cracks at the surface of a polyester TPU degraded under composting conditions. Depth of the cracks, corresponding to fungal mycelium development, increased until the formation of holes (Das et al., 2017).For the assessment of morphological surface modification of PUs, microscopy, particularly scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is employed.

        <p>SEM observations of the fungal mycelium propagation inside a PU foam highlights the higher biodegradability of open-cell foams compared to closed-cell foams. The strut of cells appeared distended, leading to the collapse of the alveolar structure (Figure 14d) (Álvarez-Barragán et al., 2016). Degradation is efficient in a PDB medium (Potatoes Dextrose Broth, rich medium) but it is specified that no degradation was observed by either weight loss or microscopy in minimal media. Small holes appeared when foams were incubated with one of the three tested strains, confirming enzymatic action. Holes in the walls and struts of the foam structure were already described previously (Figure 14e) (Gautam et al., 2007c).

For instance, Micrococcus biofilm formation on the surface of a poly(ether urea) PU was shown by microscopy (Rafiemanzelat et al., 2013). SEM can cope with the limitation of available assays to evaluate fungal growth on carbon depleted media containing polymers.

        <p>SEC analysis allows the determination of the molar mass distribution of polymers. This quantitative analysis is more powerful than weight loss because it can appraise the change of polymer mass distribution from the beginning of chains cut off even if soluble products are not released. This measurement relies on the separation of the polymer chains in a column according to their length. The polymer is solubilized in an organic solvent such as THF, chloroform, dimethylformamide (DMF), then the solution runs through a fixed column packed with porous beads (gel) with different sizes pores. Short chains pass through the pores while longer chains cannot enter and are eluted more rapidly, then the higher the retention time, the lower the molar mass is. Detection can be performed with a UV diode array detector and/or refractive index (RI) detector. UV-vis analysis is efficient for PU containing aromatic rings such as 4,4'-MDI-or TDI-based PUs (generally at 254 nm). Since the sample must be soluble in an organic solvent, this method is not suitable for PU foams. Analysis and comparison of chromatograms can be performed to evaluate PU degradation (Christenson et al., 2006;Rafiemanzelat et al., 2013). Molar masses are usually determined with polystyrene standards. Because of its aromatic rings, this standard is adapted to both UV and RI detection. Three main parameters are usually considered with the number average molar mass (Mn), the weight average molar mass (Mw) and the dispersity (Đ) (ratio of Mw over Mn).SEC analysis allows the determination of the molar mass distribution of polymers.

        <p>Polymer degradation leads to changes in the molar mass distribution. The most common observed variation on PU biodegradation studies is a decrease of the Mw whereas Mn remains unchanged, leading to a decreasing Đ value (Schmidt, J. et al., 2017). Mw being more sensitive to long polymer chains contribution, this is consistent with the cleavage of the long chains into lower molar mass molecules. In Ferris et al., only the Mw was found to decrease (Ferris et al., 2010).Polymer degradation leads to changes in the molar mass distribution.

Rafiemanzelat et al. described a bi-modal SEC profile with a high and a low molar mass distribution after 4 months soil burial degradation of a poly(ether urea) PU (Rafiemanzelat et al., 2013) resulting from the cleavage of the long polymer chains into shorter ones (Figure 15).

        <p>Observation of modifications in the physical and physicochemical properties of a sample can be an indirect method of assessing biodegradation since the polymer chain cleavage often affects some of these properties. These assays are thus used as complementary methods. Loss of mechanical properties such as uniaxial tensile strength is generally observed after significant biological degradation of a material. Tensile test measurement allows, for example, to evaluate material elasticity and the behavior at break (Phua et al., 1987). For instance, after 24 months of composting, a decrease of the tensile strength from 20 to 10 MPa was measured for a poly(ether urea) TPU. In similar degradation conditions, samples of polyester PU were already broken down into pieces and cannot be evaluated by uniaxial tensile tests (Krasowska et al., 2012). This technique was also adapted for flexible PU foams. The tensile strength increased and the elongation at break decreased after 60 days of incubation with a strain of Pseudomonas for polyester PU foams (Spontón et al., 2013) (Figure 17, PU-1 and PU-2). In contrast, no change in static mechanical properties was observed for the polyether PU foam before and after degradation (Figure 17, PU-3). The polyether PU is thus more stable than the polyester PU.Observation of modifications in the physical and physicochemical properties of a sample can be an indirect method of assessing biodegradation since the polymer chain cleavage often affects some of these properties.

        <p>PUs thermal stability may also be affected by biological degradation. This property can be measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) where the weight evolution of a sample is recorded while the temperature is increased in a furnace, under air (oxidative) or N2 (nonoxidative) environments. For most polymers, the analysis temperatures range from 0 to 600-800°C. Weight loss variations correspond to specific structure degradation and/or distinct mechanisms. The first derivative of the TGA curve (DTG) gives curve with different peaks, to determine different specific temperatures for each maximum in the case of a multistep degradation, for instance. The maximum thermal degradation temperature can be used to compare thermal stability between samples. For polyester TPUs, the first window from 100 to 300°C corresponds to the release of volatile compounds such as additives. Although urethane bonds present a reversibility at around 200°C (Delebecq et al., 2013), urethane bonds degradation induces a weight loss between 300 and 400°C while ester bond cleavage results in a weight loss between 400 and 500°C (Cangemi et al., 2006;Mathur and Prasad, 2012). A decrease in weight loss occurring between 400 and 500°C was observed after biological degradation (Mathur and Prasad, 2012). This revealed a decrease in the ester bond content per polymer and thus evidenced the biological hydrolysis of these linkages. Beyond the type of linkage affected, TGA may, therefore, provide information on the material part affected. For instance, a poly(ether urea) PU was incubated for one month with a strain of Bacillus. The observed changes in the material thermal stability attested for a higher proportion of hard segments and consequently a degradation occurring preferentially at the SS domains containing ether bonds (Rafiemanzelat et al., 2015).TGA is perfectly appropriate to analyze cross-linked foams. In their study, Gomez et al., compared the composting of a fossil-based and a biobased PU foam (Gómez et al., 2014). TGA was combined with MS analysis to identify the gaseous products of thermal degradation. They found that a bio-based, aliphatic polyester PU is more sensitive to biodegradation than the fossilbased, polyester ether PU with aromatic rings.PUs thermal stability may also be affected by biological degradation.

        <p>Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a thermal analysis which appraises the phase transitions of material. Glass transition temperature (Tg) is the temperature over which the amorphous region of a polymer transitions from a hard to a more mobile/viscous state. Working above the glass transition temperature (Tg) is an advantage for polymer degradation as it promotes chain mobility of the amorphous zone of semi-crystalline material. Temperature changes depending on the biological degrading-entities. Temperature of composting process can reach up to 58°C (Genovese et al., 2016) while degradation with single strain of bacteria or fungi are generally performed between 25 and 37°C. Enzymatic reaction can be performed at 60 or 70°C (Schmidt, J. et al., 2017). The melting temperature (Tm) is defined as the temperature of transition from a solid to a liquid state, which corresponds to the fusion of the crystalline regions. In practice, the area of this fusion peak allows determining the crystallinity of the material. The crystallinity of a poly(ether-urea) PU was found to increase after 4 months of soil incubation because of the decrease in the amorphous region preferentially degraded (Rafiemanzelat et al., 2013). This modification was accompanied by an increase in the Tm (Figure 19). Similarly, Osman et al., observed a shift of Tm from 191 to 196°C after the fungal degradation of a polyester PU (Osman et al., 2018). In addition to this change, a decrease of Tg was measured. Pilch-Pitera et al., also measured a lower Tg after PU degradation with an enzyme, associated with lower rigidity of the material (Pilch-Pitera, 2012).Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a thermal analysis which appraises the phase transitions of material.

        <p>Biological degradation can alter the hydrophobicity of a PU material. Degradation induces exposure of hydrophilic moieties on the polymer surface such as alcohol and carboxylic acid. Moreover, disruption (cracks, holes) observed on the material surface offers a higher surface area of access for water and thus higher hydrophilicity. To evaluate the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, a drop of known liquid, generally water, is deposited on the polymer surface and the contact angle is measured. With a hydrophilic material, the drop of water will collapse and the contact angle will be low. A shift from 90° to 63° has been measured after 320 days of soil burial of a polyester PU (Aranguren et al., 2012). Therefore, this polyester PU is more hydrophilic after biological degradation.Biological degradation can alter the hydrophobicity of a PU material.

A shift from 90° to 63° has been measured after 320 days of soil burial of a polyester PU (Aranguren et al., 2012). Therefore, this polyester PU is more hydrophilic after biological degradation.</p>
        <p>The identification of soluble degradation products found in the liquid phase is the best route to understand PU degradation mechanisms. Enzymatic degradation is more relevant than microbial degradation in this case. Indeed, with microbial degradation, the quantifications are biased by the possible assimilation of some degradation products by the microorganisms. Consequently, the recovered products are those that cannot be metabolized by the microorganisms.The identification of soluble degradation products found in the liquid phase is the best route to understand PU degradation mechanisms.

        <p>Quantification of these products is possible with the measurement of the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) of the soluble fraction (Yamamoto et al., 2007). This measurement can be performed only for enzymatic reactions as the amount of carbon brought by the enzyme remains stable in time contrary to microbial cultures which involve growth and thus an increase of the carbon content. Yamamoto et al., used this method to evaluate the degradation of several PUs based on LDI with various proteases. For instance, 518 ppm of carbon from degradation products were released after the degradation of a PU based on LDI and ethylene glycol, representing 44% of the theoretical carbon of the polymer. Another way to measure the release of soluble degradation products is the use of radiolabeled polymers. They were synthesized with 14 C molecules such as 14 C-TDI, 14 C ethylene diamine, 14 C 1,4-butanediol or 14 C 1,6-HDI (Santerre et al., 1994;Woo et al., 2000). The increase of radiolabeled-based molecules in the supernatant is quantified in counts per minute (CPM). This is a very sensitive method, but the cost and the hazardous exposure to radioactivity for the experimenter limit its usage. Both TOC and radioactivity measurements allow precise quantification of the degradation products release, but these techniques do not give information about the chemical structure of the corresponding degradation products.Quantification of these products is possible with the measurement of the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) of the soluble fraction (Yamamoto et al., 2007).

        <p>Another indirect way to assess PU biodegradation is to monitor the toxicity of the soluble fraction resulting from the release of toxic degradation by-products. This is the case of 4,4'-methylene dianiline (MDA), coming from the hydrolysis of MDI-based PU, which is known to be carcinogenic (McQueen and Williams, 1990). The toxicity of the soluble fraction containing degradation products can be evaluated using Microtox® bio-assay. This assay relies on a naturally luminescent bacterium, Photobacterium phosphoreum. The parameter consider is the IC50 which is, in this case, the volume of the soluble fraction that induces a decrease of the luminescence of 50% (Spontón et al., 2013). A liquid medium of a polyester PU foam incubated for 60 days with Pseudomonas sp, presented an IC50 of 13.29% (V/V) thus attesting the release of toxic products during the degradation, probably MDA or MDA-based molecules.Another indirect way to assess PU biodegradation is to monitor the toxicity of the soluble fraction resulting from the release of toxic degradation by-products.

        <p>The efficient recovery of the degradation products for their analysis is an important issue. Indeed, the liquid fraction of a degradation assay is a mixture containing salts, enzymes, and eventually microbial cellular debris and degradation products which are molecules released from the polymer. Several strategies were suggested to recover only the degradation products from PU degradation assays. This recovery can be performed by solvent extraction using, for example, ethyl acetate (Shah et al., 2016), acetonitrile (Tang et al., 2003) or ethyl ether (Spontón et al., 2013). Instead of solvent extraction, selective recovery of degradation products can also be achieved by removing enzymes using filtration (Wang et al., 1997a). Gamerith et al., added one volume of methanol and acidified the supernatant to pH 3.5 so that proteins precipitated and could be removed by centrifugation (Gamerith et al., 2016).The efficient recovery of the degradation products for their analysis is an important issue.

        <p>High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection (Thirunavukarasu et al., 2015) and mass spectrometry analyses associated with liquid chromatography (LC-MS) (Elliott et al., 2002;Wang et al., 1997b) or with gas chromatography (GC-MS) (Pérez-Lara et al., 2016) are methods of choice to identify the degradation products. These methods coupled a chromatographic, for the separation of the mix of degradation products and an analytical method such as the mass spectrometry. Detected degradation products highly depend on the initial structure of polymers. Some chemical structures of identified degradation products are shown in Figure 16. Thirunavukarasu et al., monitored the degradation of 50 mg of a poly(diethylene glycol adipate)-based PU by quantifying diethylene glycol and adipic acid with HPLC analysis. After 4 days of PU incubation with a Cryptococcus sp. lipase, about 25 mg of adipic acid and about 8 mg of diethylene glycol were released (Thirunavukarasu et al., 2015). The detection of specific amines appears as the best way to confirm the cleavage of urethane bonds. It is interesting to notice that the degradation of a PCL-based TPU (based on TDI as isocyanate starting material) with cholesterol esterase leads to the release of low molar mass urethane molecules containing TDIbased moieties but no TDA was detected (Wang et al., 1997a) (Figure 16). Then, the urethane bond has not been cleaved. MDA was the unique aromatic amine released from polycarbonatebased PUs synthesized with diverse diisocyanates (HDI, HMDI and MDI) after hydrolysis with cholesterol esterase (Tang et al., 2003). This NMR analysis was used for the identification of degradation products from the enzymatic hydrolysis of a polyester PU based on PCL. 6-hydroxycaproic acid was predominantly identified showing the efficient depolymerization of the ester linkage of the SS into the constitutive building block by the esterase E3576 (Magnin et al., 2019). PU are versatile polymers with high variability of structures, chemical compositions, formulations, morphologies, shapes, with a direct impact on the biodegradation mechanisms and kinetics. From the published literature, a large variety of potential or efficient biological degrading entities can be identified among fungi, bacteria or enzymes. Because of the diversity of substrates and analytical tools, a direct comparison of these degrading entities does not appear as an easy task. Microbial degradation of PUs remains a complex and rather obscure process. For instance, analysis of the set of enzymes produced by microorganisms during degradation often fails to understand the mechanisms involved in PU degradation.High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection (Thirunavukarasu et al., 2015) and mass spectrometry analyses associated with liquid chromatography (LC-MS) (Elliott et al., 2002;Wang et al., 1997b) or with gas chromatography (GC-MS) (Pérez-Lara et al., 2016) are methods of choice to identify the degradation products.

        <p>To tackle the degradation of the widest range of PU, the urethane bond cleavage appears as the key parameter. However, only a few techniques provide undeniable proof of urethane bond cleavage. Detection of amines derived from isocyanates as degradation products seems to be the main direct way to prove urethane bond hydrolysis. For that purpose, the recent development of new techniques such as LC/ESI/TOF-MS helps going forward in the resolution of this issue. Once mastered, the efficient enzymatic hydrolysis of the urethane bond will undoubtedly pave the way for a biological recycling of PU. Indeed, besides giving information on the degradation mechanism, released molecules resulting from PU biological depolymerization can also be considered as valuable products and used as building blocks for second-generation polymer synthesis. In the review of Cregut et al., the economic value of major building blocks was evaluated, showing the interest of recovering molecules such as diethylene glycol, adipic acid or trimethylol propane, which are products often identified after PU biological degradation (Figure 16) (Cregut et al., 2013).To tackle the degradation of the widest range of PU, the urethane bond cleavage appears as the key parameter.

        <p>Applicability of the biological recycling on mainstream PU waste still needs to be attested. As far as we know, only one study deals with the biodegradation of a real PU waste. Gautam et al., described the successful degradation of a waste polyester PU foam with a strain of Pseudomonas chlororaphis (Gautam et al., 2007c). Attempts to work with "real" PU waste (and no PU-based models) have recently been performed by Alvarez-Barragan et al. by studying the degradation of polyether-PU foam synthesized with and without the addition of a fire retardant tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) (Álvarez-Barragán et al., 2016). The TDCPP-containing foam was found to be less sensitive to biodegradation thus highlighting the need for considering thoroughly the presence of additives in real PU biological degradation assessment.Applicability of the biological recycling on mainstream PU waste still needs to be attested.
