        <p>Electro-, photo-, and photoelectrocatalysis play a critical role toward the realization of a sustainable energy economy. They facilitate numerous redox reactions in energy storage and conversion systems, enabling the production of chemical feedstock and clean fuels from abundant resources like water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. One major obstacle for their large-scale implementation is the scarcity of cost-effective, durable, and efficient catalysts. A family of twodimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) has recently emerged as promising earth-abundant candidates for large-area catalytic energy storage and conversion due to their unique properties of hydrophilicity, high metallic conductivity, and ease of production by solution processing.

MXene hybridization tunes the electronic structure towards optimal binding of redox active species to improve intrinsic activity, while increasing the density and accessibility of active sites. This review outlines recent strategies in the design of MXene hybrids for industrially relevant electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and photoelectrocatalytic applications such as water splitting, metal-air/sulfur batteries, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction. By clarifying the roles of individual material components in the MXene hybrids, we provide design strategies to synergistically couple MXenes with associated materials for highly efficient and durable catalytic applications.

        <p>The advancement of our energy economy using cost-effective, accessible, and environmentally responsible means is critical to ensure a sustainable supply to meet the burgeoning global energy demand. 1,2 In this regard, catalysts play a critical role in enabling efficient energy conversion of earth-abundant resources such as water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen to clean fuels and chemical feedstock precursors such as hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and ammonia. [3][4][5] Durable and active catalysts are also required to facilitate long-term energy storage in H 2 fuel cells and batteries of varying architectures. [6][7][8] Presently, precious platinum group metals (PGMs) such as Pt, their alloys, and related structures (PtIr, IrO 2 , RuO 2 , etc.) are widely regarded as the most effective catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. [9][10][11] The widespread commercialization and adoption into energy storage and conversion devices however, can only be realized with alternative earth-abundant and cost-effective catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability. 3,4 Since their discovery in 2011, more than 30 different compositions belonging to a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) have been successfully synthesized, with many other stable compositions predicted theoretically. [12][13][14] MXenes have attracted significant attention as promising catalysts due to their unique combination of physical and chemical properties. [13][14][15] They possess high metallic electrical conductivity with hydrophilicity similar to graphene oxide, and mechanical strength of transition metal (TM) carbides/nitrides. MXenes can be easily scaled, because of their solution processible top-down synthesis, into stable colloidal solutions or flexible films for energy applications (electrocatalysts, batteries, and supercapacitors) and beyond (flexible electronics, sensors, and electromagnetic shielding). 13,14,16 In addition to their high metallic conductivity to facilitate efficient electronic charge transport at the electrode-electrolyte interface, the large-area 2D basal planes of MXenes are HER-active, [17][18][19] unlike the widely studied semiconducting 2H-MoS 2 with HER activity restricted only to their edges. 20 Separate theoretical calculations have also predicted a variety of MXenes for efficient photocatalytic (PC), electrocatalytic (EC), and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reactions such as the hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), oxygen reduction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR), and nitrogen reduction (N 2 RR) reactions. [21][22][23][24][25] MXenes have a general formula of M n+1 X n T x where n = 1-4, M = early transition metal such as Ti, V and Mo, X = C and/or N and T x = surface termination groups such as -O, -OH, -F, and -Cl, which are formed on the outer M basal plane during the synthesis process. [26][27][28] For consistency, a standardized notation of M n+1 X n T x will be used to describe MXenes throughout this review.The advancement of our energy economy using cost-effective, accessible, and environmentally responsible means is critical to ensure a sustainable supply to meet the burgeoning global energy demand. 1,2 In this regard, catalysts play a critical role in enabling efficient energy conversion of earth-abundant resources such as water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen to clean fuels and chemical feedstock precursors such as hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and ammonia.

        <p>MXenes are most commonly produced through the top-down separation of layered MXene sheets from their parent layered ternary TM carbide MAX phase materials ("A" = group 13 or 14 elements such as Al, Si, and Ga) by aqueous wet selective etching and removal of A-group atom layers. 12,27 The A-group atom layers are preferentially etched away as the M-A bonds binding the MXene layers together in the MAX structure are chemically more active than the stronger M-X bonds within the MXene sheets. [29][30][31] This scalable top-down etching process to produce MXenes is most commonly conducted under ambient conditions with gentle heating using hydrofluoric acid (HF) directly, or HF produced in-situ from F-containing etchants. [32][33][34][35] After etching away the Agroup atom layers, the exposed outer M basal planes of the etched MXene sheets are functionalized with hydrophilic surface termination groups (T x ) such as -O, -OH, -F and -Cl due to the aqueous F-or Cl-containing etchants. 14,31,36 The surface chemistry of MXenes can be controlled to some extent by the selective wet etching conditions or through post-etch processing to optimize binding toward specific electroactive species for efficient catalysis. 18,37 Subsequent delamination and exfoliation separates the weakly bound MXene sheets into single-or few-layered MXenes using intercalants, 38,39 exposing large MXene surface areas for catalysis and to serve as a conductive support for co-catalysts.MXenes are most commonly produced through the top-down separation of layered MXene sheets from their parent layered ternary TM carbide MAX phase materials ("A" = group 13 or 14 elements such as Al, Si, and Ga) by aqueous wet selective etching and removal of A-group atom layers. 12,27 The A-group atom layers are preferentially etched away as the M-A bonds binding the MXene layers together in the MAX structure are chemically more active than the stronger M-X bonds within the MXene sheets.

        <p>Most recently, organic and inorganic materials such as TM compounds (carbides, phosphides, chalcogenides, oxides, etc.), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), carbon-based (C-based) materials such as graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), quantum dots (QDs), metallic alloys, and polymers have been combined with MXenes to form MXene hybrids and composites. [40][41][42][43][44][45] These MXene hybrids exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic activities and stability beyond the sum of their individual components, due to synergistic coupling between MXenes and the secondary materials. The strong and intimate coupling increases the density of catalytically active sites, and optimizes these active sites toward binding of electrochemically active species for efficient catalysis. [40][41][42][43][44][45] The hybrid mix can perform a variety of functions such as a large-area, electronically conductive support, electronic structure modulator, and co-catalyst, [40][41][42][43][44][45] as we discuss in this review. Indeed, MXene hybrids have garnered significant traction since 2014, with the number of papers published doubling year-on-year, and more than half (168) of the publications on MXene hybrids in 2019 (312) focused on catalysis and energy storage (Figure 1a).

        <p>In this review, we summarize recent strategies in the design of MXene hybrids for industrially relevant EC, PC, and PEC applications in energy storage (metal-air/sulfur batteries catalyzed by OER, ORR, and sulfur redox reactions) and conversion (water splitting catalyzed by OER and HER). We clarify the roles of each material component in the MXene hybrids for their intended applications to provide a set of rational design rules to synergistically couple MXenes with the relevant secondary materials for highly efficient and durable catalysis. The feasibility of MXene hybrids for important emerging catalytic applications such as CO 2 RR and N 2 RR is then discussed. The review concludes by highlighting key gaps in the current fundamental understanding of MXene hybrids and provides an outlook to inform forthcoming MXene hybrid designs in catalytic energy storage and conversion applications.In this review, we summarize recent strategies in the design of MXene hybrids for industrially relevant EC, PC, and PEC applications in energy storage (metal-air/sulfur batteries catalyzed by OER, ORR, and sulfur redox reactions) and conversion (water splitting catalyzed by OER and HER).

        <p>The layered nature and variety in surface T x groups of MXenes 30 afford a high degree of tuneability in their properties [13][14][15] and hence, strong compatibility with a wide range of secondary materials to produce MXene hybrids with high catalytic performances.

        <p>MXenes include, but are not limited to, Ti 2 CT x , 54 Ti 3 C 2 T x , 55,56 67 and Ta 4 C 3 T x . 68 Since rapid electronic charge transfer is crucial to efficient electrocatalysis, Ti 3 C 2 T x is most extensively incorporated into MXene hybrids for electrocatalytic applications, due to their high electrical conductivity (up to 15000 S cm -1 ) 69 as compared to other MXenes. The wide diversity in MXenecompatible secondary materials (TM compounds, supramolecular structures, C-based materials, and metals), coupled with the many different synthetic methods to form these hybrids (Figure 2), illustrates the boundless potential for MXene hybrids and composites to meet the various demands in energy-related applications and beyond. [40][41][42][43][44] strongly and chemically coupled MXene hybrid synergistically increases the hybrid's intrinsic activity, while secondary material dislodgement or degradation during electrocatalysis is prevented, especially at large applied potentials. 70 MXene hybrids are synthesized through three main routes: (1) in-situ conversion of the MXenes' surface structure through oxidation (e.g. Ti 3 C 2 T x to TiO 2 ) 55 or sulfidation (e.g. Mo 2 TiC 2 T x to MoS 2 ), 67 (2) reactive chemical formation of secondary materials on MXenes, using methods such as hydro/solvothermal synthesis, 47,71,72 solution processing, 73 or deposition, [74][75][76][77][78][79] and (3) non-reactive assembly of secondary materials by drop-casting 80 and adsorption processes. 56 In this section, we summarize the common and unique features for each of these three synthetic routes for MXene hybrid formation, highlighting their suitability, advantages, and shortfalls (and how they have been overcome).MXenes include, but are not limited to, Ti 2 CT x , 54 Ti 3 C 2 T x , 55,56 67 and Ta 4 C 3 T x . 68 Since rapid electronic charge transfer is crucial to efficient electrocatalysis, Ti 3 C 2 T x is most extensively incorporated into MXene hybrids for electrocatalytic applications, due to their high electrical conductivity (up to 15000 S cm -1 ) 69 as compared to other MXenes.

        <p>In-situ conversion of MXene surfaces to form MXene hybrids. The layered structure of MXenes leaves the TM atomic layers exposed on their outer basal planes (left schematics in Figure 2). These TM layers are highly oxophilic 81,82 and hence prone to surface reactions such as oxidation (e.g. Ti to TiO 2 in Ti 3 C 2 T x ) 55 or sulfidation (e.g. Mo to MoS 2 in Mo 2 TiC 2 T x ). 67 In these processes, the MXenes' surface is transformed, either partially or fully, to form a second material. We thus refer to this process as an in-situ conversion of the MXenes' surface. The advantage of surface conversion is clear: the second material is strongly integrated with MXenes, forming a hybrid interface. 67 Since the MXene surfaces are directly involved in the conversion, no additional TM source is required for the secondary material growth. Consequently, this process is self-limited by the MXenes' surface exposure, 67 minimizing the issue of excessive secondary material nucleation and growth that would otherwise restrict access of reactants to catalytically active sites.In-situ conversion of MXene surfaces to form MXene hybrids.

        <p>Most surface conversions involve the treatment of MXenes with gases such as O 2 or CO 2 for oxidation, or H 2 S for sulfidation. These processes are typically conducted at elevated temperatures to form highly crystalline secondary materials on MXene surfaces. 67,83 Hence, there exists a delicate balance between the extent of MXene conversion, and preserving the MXenes' structural integrity that can be compromised in oxidizing environments at high temperatures. 83 The range of secondary materials that can be grown through MXene surface conversion is also limited by the chemical identity and reactivity of the MXenes' TM surface exposed. For instance, the Ti surface of Ti 3 C 2 T x implies that only Ti-based secondary materials can be grown through this conversion route. In this regard, we anticipate that disordered solid solution MXenes such as (Ti,V) 2 CT x and (Mo,V) 4 C 3 T x , denoted by the chemical formula P , Q n+1 C n T x , will be interesting for growth of secondary materials through this surface conversion route, since they possess two different TMs at the surface in a random distribution. 84 Thermally-assisted oxidation is an efficient one-step method to produce MXene/TM oxide hybrids. 41,43 MXene surface oxidation is most commonly employed in Ti-based MXenes to form TiO 2 photocatalysts, 55 although oxidation can be also applied to V, Nb, and Mo-based MXenes to form their respective oxides. 58,62,82 In-situ oxidation is achieved through flash oxidation (1150 °C, 30 s), 55 prolonged oxidation from calcination (350-650 °C), [85][86][87] hydro/solvothermal processes (120-220 °C), 47,78,[88][89][90][91] or CO 2 oxidation (500-900 °C). 62,83 For example, Ti 3 C 2 T x has been oxidized to varying degrees to produce hybrids ranging from Ti 3 C 2 T x /TiO 2 (partial MXene surface oxidation) to C/TiO 2 (complete MXene oxidation). 83,92,93 While controlled partial oxidation retained some of the Ti-C layered structure from the MXene precursor, 92 complete oxidation degraded the entire MXene structure. 83 The latter resulted in a Ti-O structure supported by C-C bonded layers, in the form of TiO 2 on 2D carbon sheets (C/TiO 2 ). 83,94 The morphology and phase of the resulting TiO 2 NPs was also highly dependent on the treatment conditions. 83,95 This is important as the identity and quantity of exposed facets, together with the distribution and phase of TiO 2 formed, directly influences PC activity. 47,93 Ghassemi et al. utilized in-situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the oxidation mechanism of Ti 3 C 2 T x under various conditions (Figure 3a). 96 In flash oxidation, the exposed Ti basal planes serve as nucleating sites to form a thin 2D anatase TiO 2 film. Subsequently, the 2D TiO 2 nuclei grew vertically to form 3D TiO 2 anatase NPs from the outward migration of inner Ti layer atoms. Conversely, a slower heating process yielded rutile TiO 2 NPs without the formation of the intermediate anatase phase.Most surface conversions involve the treatment of MXenes with gases such as O 2 or CO 2 for oxidation, or H 2 S for sulfidation.

[74][75][76][77][78][79] Most of these synthetic routes, except physical deposition, rely on the van der Waals 53 or ionic/electrostatic 106 interactions between the negatively charged MXene surfaces (from the T x groups) and positively charged secondary material precursors. 41 After initial adsorption, the secondary materials are formed in-situ onto the MXenes' surface through chemical processing with additional reactants and/or heat treatment. 101,107 Hydro/solvothermal synthesis exploits the interactions between the liquid solvent, mineralizer (e.g. base), and precursor moieties at elevated temperatures and pressures, mimicking the processes occurring at the Earth's crust. 108 This synthesis route is a simple and scalable way to synthesize many different types of secondary materials (Figure 2) in various morphologies, [109][110][111] and is versatile enough to yield solid solution mixtures 112 or different material allotropes 113 by carefully tuning the processing conditions. Although hydrothermal synthesis is typically directed at bulk material synthesis, heterogeneous nucleation and epitaxial films can be achieved by adding suitable substrates. 114,115 A major challenge in this route is aggressive corrosion by water molecules or -OH moieties at elevated temperatures and pressures, which may induce undesired damage to the MXenes. 70 This can be partially alleviated by replacing water with non-aqueous solvents, thus the term solvothermal. 116 Wu et al. proposed the addition of glucose to the solvent to protect MXenes from oxidative damage. 70 During the reaction, glucose molecules were adhered on MXene surfaces via hydrogen bonding and converted to a simple hydrocarbon coating (Figure 4a), which was subsequently converted to carbon with thermal treatment. The carbon coating was shown to improve charge transport characteristics and prevent secondary material aggregation. 117 Solution processing at ambient pressure is an alternative to hydro/solvothermal treatment, since the gentler reaction conditions can reduce unwanted MXene damage. 73 To achieve controlled growth, metallic precursors are first adsorbed onto MXenes via a mixing process.

        <p>Summary, specific challenges, and outlook for processing of MXene hybrids. We have described how MXene hybrids can be formed through (1) in-situ conversion by using MXene surfaces as reactants, (2) direct chemical growth of secondary materials on MXenes, and (3) deposition of secondary materials on MXenes. The processing method employed for MXene hybrids formation is highly dependent on their intended catalytic application. For instance, PC applications require semiconducting photo-absorbers, which can be formed via in-situ oxidation or hydro/solvothermal treatment of Ti-based MXenes. 89 In contrast, oxide formation on MXenes is detrimental to electrocatalysis, as oxides are less conductive and limit charge transport properties, 148 so a self-assembly process may be more appropriate.

These C-based supports, however, had to be first functionalized to rGO/GO before they could be integrated with LDHs, compromising the support's structural integrity and conductivity. Therefore, Yu et al. exploited the negatively charged surface T x groups of MXenes to electrostatically self-assemble FeNi-LDH nanostructures vertically on Ti 3 C 2 T x in a 3D array (Figure 4b). 126 The vertical growth of LDH atop MXenes reduced repulsion and aggregation between positively charged LDH sheets while maximizing ECSA for catalysis. 153,181 The benefits of strong chemical coupling within the hybrid was evident in their OER performance (Figure 6e) and stability (Figure 6f), which are far superior to the physical mixture (FeNi-LDH + Ti 3 C 2 T x ) or when the FeNi-LDH OER catalyst was hybridized with a less conductive substrate (FeNi-LDH/rGO) instead of MXenes. The reasoning for the enhanced OER is attributed to the increased oxidation state of Ni and Fe centers after hybridization, as shown in the +0.5 eV shift of the Ni and Fe 2p XPS peaks. 126 A follow-up work integrated the FeNi-LDH/Ti 3 C 2 T x structure with a 3D nickel foam network to further maximize ECSA and mass transport, achieving a high current density of 500 mA cm -2 at very low overpotentials for alkaline OER (300 mV), HER (205 mV), and bifunctional water splitting (1.75 V vs. RHE). 149 Separately, extensive growth of Co-LDH on Ti 3 C 2 T x was successful in arresting Ti 3 C 2 T x surface oxidation during OER, which would have impeded both charge transfer at the MXene-LDH interface, and overall electronic conductivity in the hybrid. 186 The LDH-MXene hybrids can also be processed further to form bifunctional catalysts like phospho-sulfides.

        <p>As discussed previously, MXenes generally exhibit only modest OER activity and hence rely on hybridization with OER-active catalysts (such as TM chalcogenides 102 and LDHs 126,149 ), with the MXenes serving primarily as conductive supports and electronic modulators. 44,139 Thus, most PC/PEC applications of MXenes and their hybrids are directed at HER instead of OER to take advantage of MXenes' HER activity. In this endeavor, MXenes, especially Ti-based MXenes, have been employed as precursors to TM oxides with rich vacancies, which are widely considered as stable, efficient, and robust HER photocatalysts. 83,97,100 Yuan et al. oxidized Ti 3 C 2 T x in CO 2 at high temperatures to produce a 2D MXene-derived C/TiO 2 hybrid. 83 Since the Ti and C atoms were already alternately arranged in the MXene structure (Ti 3 C 2 T x ), calcination is likely to result in alternating TiO 2 and 2D carbon sheets, while retaining the large-area 2D-layered structure of MXenes, which is suitable for PC HER (Figure 7a). After optimizing for calcination temperature and CO 2 flow rates, C/TiO 2 -700-150 hybrid exhibited the highest PC H 2 generation rate of 24 Z g -1 h -1 , representing an 89-fold enhancement from TiO 2 . This was credited to the thin carbon layers facilitating charge transport, whose high electrical conductivity improved photo-carrier separation efficiency and reduced their recombination rate, in agreement with other works. 100,190,191 The thin carbon layers also provided a high degree of transparency for visible light penetration to the TiO 2 photo-absorber. This method was also employed to synthesize S-doped TiO 2 NPs/C (Figure 7b) from S-doped Ti 3 C 2 T x , whereby S doping further optimized H + binding energy for efficient HER. 97 The strategy of using MXenes as precursors to synthesize MXene/TM oxide hybrids has also been applied to other MXenes, given the relative ease in oxidizing MXenes, 192,193 such as in the oxidation of Nb 2 CT x to Nb 2 CT x /C/Nb 2 O 5 , 194 Mo 2 CT x to Mo 2 C/MoO x , 148 and V 2 CT x to V 2 CT x /V 2 O x . 57,195 Apart from acting as TM oxide precursors, MXenes can also serve as efficient PC/PEC HER co-catalysts themselves to promote photo-generated charge carrier separation when coupled to semiconductors. 133,[196][197][198][199] The most widely studied MXene, Ti 3 C 2 T x , has been applied as a PC HER co-catalyst and successfully coupled to a variety of semiconducting photocatalysts such as TM oxides, 191,196 sulfides, 124,187 perovskites, 197,198 and g-C 3 N 4 . 133,199 For instance, Ran et al. investigated the use of Ti 3 C 2 T x as a HER co-catalyst, with CdS acting as a photo-absorber for PC HER. 187 The electrostatic self-assembly of CdS NPs on Ti 3 C 2 T x NPs produced cauliflower-structured sub-microspheres (referred to as CTX, where X refers to the mass ratio of MXenes : CdS) with distinct and well-formed Ti 3 C 2 T x /CdS interfaces (Figure 7c). An optimal 2.5 wt% MXene incorporation (CT2.5) resulted in a substantial 136-fold improvement in H 2 production rate compared to bare CdS (CT0, Figure 7d). In fact, the strongly coupled Lattice strain induced at the MXene-secondary material interfaces can also alter electronic density and stabilize metastable co-catalyst material phases through strain and phase engineering. Apart from activity enhancement, MXene hybrids also benefit from improved stability in acidic and alkaline electrolytes (Figure 5f). 126 A strong and chemically coupled MXene hybrid, especially at the hybrid interface, is important for prolonged cycling and operational stability, particularly at higher current densities. 149 The NiFe-LDH/Ti 3 C 2 T x /3D nickel foam hybrid was stable for 200 h of continuous water splitting in 1 M KOH at a high current density of 100 mA cm -2 due to the strong chemical integration between the LDH, MXenes, and 3D nickel foam network. 149 Conversely, Mo 2 CT x /2H-MoS 2 hybrid suffered a significant SF3O loss in operating current density after a short 8 h of HER. 200 This was due to crack formation within the hybrid, and MoS 2 dislodgement during HER, possibly due to poor chemical integration between Mo 2 CT x and 2H-MoS 2 .As discussed previously, MXenes generally exhibit only modest OER activity and hence rely on hybridization with OER-active catalysts (such as TM chalcogenides 102 and LDHs 126,149 ), with the MXenes serving primarily as conductive supports and electronic modulators. 44,139 Thus, most PC/PEC applications of MXenes and their hybrids are directed at HER instead of OER to take advantage of MXenes' HER activity.

        <p>As such, we believe that MXene hybrids can offer a viable value proposition. In addition to their excellent electronic conductivity, thin MXene layers would be a superior catalyst support choice compared to other C-based materials, due to stronger metal-support interactions. 247 Furthermore, the possibility of intermetallic compound formation has been reported, 248 revealing an active surface with a unique electronic structure that is more resistant to agglomeration. 249 For example, Mo 2 CO 2 MXene has been predicted as a good Pd support. 250 Specifically, a more active Pd dimer species that allows for partial methane oxidation to methanol can be stabilized on Mo 2 CO 2 MXenes. 250 We note that most experimental CO 2 RR on MXenes or their hybrids were conducted using PC/PEC instead of EC. This is intriguing, as apart from the photophysical processes, PC should share many commonalities with EC. 253 Discrepancies between the measured activities of the same TM catalyst (or co-catalyst) species in EC and PC approaches have been reported. 254 These discrepancies can be partly attributed to the attenuated work function under steady state illumination and interfacial voltage loss, 255 limited cathodic potential range (i.e. conduction band position), 256 and temporal discontinuity between the photo-generated carrier lifetime (fs to ms) and reaction kinetics (ms to s). 256,257 Besides impacting catalytic activity, we believe that these differences may enhance the selectivity in PC CO 2 RR, as the diverse intermediate stability in CO 2 RR and rate of competitive HER is sensitive to the applied potential. 202 A commonly adopted hybrid combination for PC CO 2 RR is MXenes coupled with a wider bandgap photo-absorber. MXenes made to date are metallic and some are predicted to have narrow bandgaps, 258 thus hybridization with a wider bandgap photo-absorber is the only way to generate sufficient photo-carriers for catalysis. A notable example is the Ti 3 C 2 T x /g-C 3 N 4 hybrid which produced 2.24-5.19 and 0.04-0.05 µmol g -1 h -1 of CO and CH 4 respectively. 259,260 Although g-C 3 N 4 is a very good photo-absorber with high quantum yield even at visible wavelengths [ &gt;395 nm), 261 it is limited by rapid charge recombination. 262 The role of Ti 3 C 2 T x in the hybrid is likely that of a charge separator, as their work function position is suitably positioned to accept electrons from the g-C 3 N 4 conduction band, thus enhancing the photo-generated carrier lifetime (Figure 11a). 259 The activity of Ti 3 C 2 T x /g-C 3 N 4 was further enhanced considerably by depositing Pd on the hybrid structure, which produced formate and methanol at a rate of 905 and 350 µmol g -1 h -1 , respectively, in a PEC setting. 263 Pd is a very interesting co-catalyst choice, because it is known to bind very strongly to adsorbed *CO in EC CO 2 RR, 264 which often leads to catalyst deactivation.As such, we believe that MXene hybrids can offer a viable value proposition.

        <p>The authors attributed the high activity of the Ti 3 C 2 T x /g-C 3 N 4 /Pd hybrid to electron trapping by protonic species on the Pd surface, but we speculate that the stronger binding may allow the key *CO intermediate to persist longer, allowing for photo-electron accumulation and transfer.The authors attributed the high activity of the Ti 3 C 2 T x /g-C 3 N 4 /Pd hybrid to electron trapping by protonic species on the Pd surface, but we speculate that the stronger binding may allow the key *CO intermediate to persist longer, allowing for photo-electron accumulation and transfer.</p>
        <p>Depending on the relative band positions, hybridization of metals (i.e. MXenes) with semiconductors often results in a built-in Schottky junction. This increases the electronic transport resistance and it is thus generally undesired. However, in PC, the Schottky barrier junction may actually improve the overall carrier lifetime by minimizing the electron losses associated with back injections. One example of the adoption of this strategy is reported in Ti 3 C 2 T x /CeO 2 , which produced up to 40.2 µmol g -1 h -1 of CO. 265 The built-in junction may also exist in many other examples, especially in hybrids involving wide-bandgap n-type semiconductors such as TiO 2 , 85 Bi 2 WO 6 , 101 or CsPbBr 3 , 125 although this is hard to ascertain as the MXenes' work function varies 243 depending on the actual T x composition in the reaction environment. Hybridization with these semiconductors generally yield modest CO 2 RR activity (Table S4a), of up to 28 µmol g -1 h -1 products for Ti 3 C 2 T x /P25/TiO 2 . 266 While a slightly higher activity was observed for Ti 3 C 2 T x /CsPbBr 3 (32 µmol g -1 h -1 CO and 14 µmol g -1 h -1 CH 4 ), the perovskite's (CsPbBr 3 ) instability in aqueous solutions necessitated the use of ethyl acetate as the electrolyte. 125 of the hexagonal Ti 3 C 2 T x QDs was estimated to be significantly lower than the "bulk" Ti 3 C 2 T x sheets (Figures 11d and11e), which resulted in more facile electron transfer from the Cu 2 O photoabsorber, at a potential above the thermodynamic requirement for CO 2 RR to methanol (-0.81 V vs. RHE, Figure 11f). 202 The Ti 3 C 2 T x QD/Cu 2 O hybrid supplied 78.5 µmol g -1 h -1 of methanol.Depending on the relative band positions, hybridization of metals (i.e. MXenes) with semiconductors often results in a built-in Schottky junction.

While the PC activity of CdS in reducing aromatic nitro-compounds is not surprising, hybridization with MXenes significantly enhanced their activity and photo-stability. It was proposed that hybridization with CdS formed a Janus-like structure, characterized by the strong metallic adsorption of Cd onto Ti 3 C 2 T x , 268 thus limiting the dissolution of CdS.

        <p>MXenes hybrids and composites for electrocatalytic/photocatalytic (EC/PC) nitrogen reduction (N 2 RR). The abundance of N 2 in the air has attracted many attempts to convert them to nitrate and ammonium compounds for agricultural applications. Combined with steam reforming of natural gas, the Haber-Bosch process is still widely used in modern ammonia production plants worldwide today. Although the Haber-Bosch process is an exothermic reaction overall, it still requires a massive energy input to drive the a bond dissociation (941 kJ mol -1 ) through the dissociative pathway over a suitable catalyst (Figure 12a). 269 EC/PC N 2 RR offers an attractive alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. With the ability to be conducted under ambient conditions, N 2 RR is potentially safer, cleaner, and a more sustainable way to produce NH 3 with a smaller plant footprint when coupled with sustainable energy inputs. Unlike the Haber-Bosch process with a kinetically 270 (or thermodynamically, 271 depending on the substrate) limited a dissociation step, PC/EC N 2 RR preferentially undergoes the associative pathway, whereby the adsorbed N 2 molecule first undergoes stepwise protonation. 269 The associative N 2 RR pathway diverges to three main pathways depending on the initial N 2 adsorption geometry (Figure 12b): alternating and distal protonation mechanisms operate when N 2 is adsorbed end-on, while the enzymatic mechanism operates after N 2 is adsorbed side-on. 272,273 There are also possibilities of pathway inter-mixing, depending on the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers. 274 Side-on N 2 adsorption is more favorable on the basal planes of bare M 2 C MXenes, 24,275,276 M 3 C 2 MXenes with group 14 "M" elements (Figure 12d), 277 and ordered double TM Mo 2 TiC 2 T x MXenes. 278 Conversely, distal adsorption is preferred on M 3 C 2MXenes hybrids and composites for electrocatalytic/photocatalytic (EC/PC) nitrogen reduction (N 2 RR).

        <p>x is the most commonly used MXene for PC/EC N 2 RR due to their stability 284 and close structural relationship with the popular TiO 2 photocatalyst. Ti 3 C 2 T x has been reported to perform EC N 2 RR with modest NH 3 yields (157-522 Z g -1 h -1 ) and FE at relatively low cathodic potentials (-0.1 to -0.4 V vs. RHE), with electrochemical and structural stability. 239,279 Investigations into MXene hybrids, especially through the use of single atom dopants, have predicted attractive N 2 RR activity, as the single atom dopants provide more favorable N 2 adsorption sites and correspondingly lower activation barriers. A range of in-silico single atom modifications (boron 274 and various TMs 271,285,286 ) have been studied, with Ru, Mo, Ti, and Fe commonly identified as promising dopants with the least negative N 2 RR limiting potentials. Apart from calculating the lowest energy pathway from N 2 to NH 3 , it is also critical to evaluate the formation energy and the stability of the hybrid through first principle calculations, or from more realistic kinetic stability studies. 287 Experimentally, Ti 3 C 2 T x has been used to support metallic N 2 RR electrocatalysts such as Ru (2321 Z g -1 h -1 and 13% FE) 288 and fine (&lt;10 nm) Au NPs (1761 Z g -1 h -1 and 18.3% FE), 289 ). 86 This recent work demonstrated that the hybrid's photo-response extends up to the nearinfrared region.

Interestingly, the hybridization process introduced significant O-vacancies in TiO 2 , as indicated by the broadening of the Raman peak around 1500 cm -1 , and a strong low temperature electron spin resonance (ESR) signal (Figure 13d). The defective TiO 2 sites acted as an alternative adsorption site (Figure 12c) alongside Ti 3 C 2 (Figure 12d), which enabled a higher coverage of adsorbed *N 2 . At the optimum Ti 3 C 2 T x loading of 6%, the NH 3 yield of the hybrid was 10.74 Z g -1 h -1 without any sacrificial reagents. The NH 3 yield was further enhanced to 43.44 Z g -1 h -1 after 0.02 M CH 3 OH was added as a sacrificial electron donor (Figure 13e), indicating that the anodic reaction (water oxidation) is still a significant bottleneck.recently investigated the role of Ti 3 C 2 T x in enhancing TiO 2 N 2 RR activity. 280 In this work, the authors mixed P25 TiO 2 (80% anatase and 20% rutile phase) with Ti 3 C 2 T x and treated them in N 2 atmosphere.

By carefully considering the MXenes' properties (T x groups, basal plane defects, edge charges, and identity of the outer metal surface), a variety of secondary materials can be chemically coupled with MXenes to form MXene hybrids with varying architectures, from vertically-aligned nanomaterials on MXenes to lateral coverages of MXenes and even more complex 3D mesoporous structures.In this review, we discussed the design rules behind MXene hybrids for catalytic energy storage and conversion applications.

        <p>In general, MXenes and their hybrids are susceptible to oxidative degradation in environments containing water and/or oxygen, 193 and under applied anodic potentials in aqueous media, 29 both of which are common in catalysis. The MXenes' instability should thus be thoughtfully considered when designing MXene hybrids for energy storage and conversion. This can be circumvented through recent advances in the synthesis (F-free 295 and/or aqueous-free 296,297 ), storage, 193,298 and stabilization (in thin films 299 or colloids 300 ) of MXenes. These breakthroughs also offer greater flexibility and control of surface T x groups for targeted hybrid assembly. This can be translated to the preparation of stable MXenes and their hybrids for water-sensitive applications, such as non-polar organic composites, polymer inks for additive manufacturing, and organic electrolytes for supercapacitors and batteries, 301,302 and are also highly relevant for communities working on flexible electronics, biomedical, and electromagnetic applications.In general, MXenes and their hybrids are susceptible to oxidative degradation in environments containing water and/or oxygen, 193 and under applied anodic potentials in aqueous media, 29 both of which are common in catalysis.

        <p>Additionally, we expect directed efforts to be made beyond mono-metal MXenes to synthesize multi-metal MXenes such as ordered double MXenes (M' 2 MC 2 T x and M' 2 M 2 C 3 T x ), which have already been theoretically predicted to possess high levels of HER activity. 303 Adding to the already-growing MXenes family, disordered double TM solid solution MXenes such as (Ti,V) 2 CT x and (Mo,V) 4 C 3 T x are also attractive prospects for synthesis and characterization, given the ease of tuning their electrochemical and physical properties based on their compositions. 84,304 Another key challenge lies in the expansion of existing etching methods to ternary transition metal nitrides MAX materials to produce nitride MXenes, since only Ti 2 NT x has been produced in this manner, 305 while Ti 4 N 3 T x has only been synthesized through harsh molten fluoride salt etching. 19,201 Other Mo-containing nitride MXenes are instead produced through ammoniating their corresponding carbide MXenes with NH 3 gas at a similarly high temperature of 600°C. 306 Additionally, closely related 2D MXene-like TM nitrides, such as MoN, have also been reported to be catalytically active for energy storage and conversion applications. [307][308][309] Investigating these layered 2D MXene-like TM nitrides can potentially reveal important insights into the predicted stability and chemical reactivity of MXene nitrides. In all, expanding the MXenes family can create more possibilities in advanced MXene hybrid design to realize theoretically predicted properties and competitive performances as multi-functional MXene hybrids and composites.Additionally, we expect directed efforts to be made beyond mono-metal MXenes to synthesize multi-metal MXenes such as ordered double MXenes (M' 2 MC 2 T x and M' 2 M 2 C 3 T x ), which have already been theoretically predicted to possess high levels of HER activity. 303 Adding to the already-growing MXenes family, disordered double TM solid solution MXenes such as (Ti,V) 2 CT x and (Mo,V) 4 C 3 T x are also attractive prospects for synthesis and characterization, given the ease of tuning their electrochemical and physical properties based on their compositions. 84,304 Another key challenge lies in the expansion of existing etching methods to ternary transition metal nitrides MAX materials to produce nitride MXenes, since only Ti 2 NT x has been produced in this manner, 305 while Ti 4 N 3 T x has only been synthesized through harsh molten fluoride salt etching. 19,201 Other Mo-containing nitride MXenes are instead produced through ammoniating their corresponding carbide MXenes with NH 3 gas at a similarly high temperature of 600°C. 306 Additionally, closely related 2D MXene-like TM nitrides, such as MoN, have also been reported to be catalytically active for energy storage and conversion applications.

        <p>For each of the industrially relevant catalytic energy storage (metal-air/sulfur batteries) and conversion (water splitting, HER, OER, CO 2 RR and N 2 RR) applications, we clarified the roles of each material component in the MXene hybrids -a conductive support, co-catalyst, electronic structure modulator, photo-carrier generator and phase stabilizer, to name a few. More importantly, we described how strong chemical and electronic coupling within the hybrid can induce directed morphological growth, alter the electronic structure, and create more catalytically active motifs for synergistic enhancement in catalytic activity and stability. By combining T x control, doping and hybridization to modulate the electronic density and intrinsic activity of active site, coupled with nanostructuring to increase the density and accessibility of those active sites, many MXene hybrids have outperformed their separate individual components in both catalytic activity and stability. We also provide application-specific challenges and our outlook at the end of each application section for readers working on those applications. A summary of key performance metrics for HER, OER, ORR, CO 2 RR and N 2 RR is provided in Tables S2-S4 for the reader's convenience.For each of the industrially relevant catalytic energy storage (metal-air/sulfur batteries) and conversion (water splitting, HER, OER, CO 2 RR and N 2 RR) applications, we clarified the roles of each material component in the MXene hybrids -a conductive support, co-catalyst, electronic structure modulator, photo-carrier generator and phase stabilizer, to name a few.

        <p>MXene hybrids and composites have achieved superior catalytic energy storage and conversion performances compared to traditional materials, and we anticipate further advances as the chemical and electronic nature of the MXene hybrid interfaces are elucidated using a powerful combination of in-situ/operando experiments and theoretical modelling. 21,202,238 A better understanding of the dynamics at the MXenes' hybrid surface and interface in the presence of reactive species, solvent, and applied potential is indispensable toward building a more realistic and multi-scale MXene hybrid model that incorporates the effects of electrochemical potential, solvation, and micro-kinetics into the current purely atomistic view of DFT, as recently demonstrated on metallic catalysts. [310][311][312] So far, operando measurements demonstrated on bare MXenes 19 have clarified our fundamental understanding of the localized electrochemical activity and electronic structure at the catalytic surface. For this purpose, it is not unreasonable to use MXene-like surrogate structures that can be synthesized using bottom-up approaches with atomic precision (CVD and ALD) for such fundamental studies. 65,66,148 Finally, efforts can be undertaken in the development of mild and scalable top-down MXene synthesis and hybridization techniques to (1) minimize MXene oxidation and mechanical damage during processing especially at high temperatures, 192,193 (2) enable greater control over the chemical composition, morphology and distribution of the secondary material grown on MXenes, and (3) realize highly porous and 3D MXene hybrid networks for efficient mass and long-range charge transport to further enhance catalytic activity. 169 Given the rapid rise in interest amongst MXene hybrids and composites, we expect an increase in both experimental and theoretical efforts towards developing MXene hybrids for clean energy and related applications in the near future.
