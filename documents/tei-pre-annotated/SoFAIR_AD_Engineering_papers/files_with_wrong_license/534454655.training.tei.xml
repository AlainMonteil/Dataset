        <p>The development of classical and quantum information processing technology calls for on-chip integrated sources of structured light. While integrated vortex microlasers have been demonstrated earlier, they remain static and possess relatively high lasing thresholds, thus being not suitable for high-speed optical communication and computing. We introduce perovskite-based vortex microlasers, and demonstrate their application to ultrafast all-optical switching at room temperatures. By exploiting both mode symmetry and far-field properties, we reveal that the vortex beam lasing can be switched to linearly polarized beam lasing or vice versa with switching time of 1-1.5ps and energy consumption orders of magnitude lower than in the previously demonstrated all-optical switching. Our results provide an approach to break the long-standing trade-off between low-energy consumption and high-speed nanophotonics, introducing the vortex microlasers switchable at terahertz frequencies.The development of classical and quantum information processing technology calls for on-chip integrated sources of structured light.

        <p>Owing to their mutual orthogonality, vortex beams with different topological charges have been suggested as an effective approach to revolutionize classical and quantum communications (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8). Vortex beams with well-defined topological charges have been developed by using external phase elements such as spiral phase plates, computer generated holograms, and metasurfaces (5-8, 9, 10). Recently, being driven by the demand for compact displays and high-density integration, on-chip vortex microlasers have attracted much attention (5)(6)(7)11). The compact vortex microlasers are usually realized by transforming conventional optical cavities into spiral waveguides (6) or micropillar chains (7), and modulating them with additional asymmetric scatterers (5). Although the reported performance in both directional output and generation efficiency of orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams is impressive, the Q factors of such vortex microlasers are strongly reduced by scattering losses and thus their energy consumption is large (5)(6)(7)12). In addition, onchip integrated vortex microlasers are either static (5,6) or controllable in emission chirality via the circularly polarized optical pump (7), thus being not suitable for ultrafast optical networks (8). Most importantly, due to the rundown time of an optical resonance, there appears a trade-off between low-energy consumption and high modulation speed in nanophotonics, restricting the application in modern optical computing and optical communications.Owing to their mutual orthogonality, vortex beams with different topological charges have been suggested as an effective approach to revolutionize classical and quantum communications (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8).

        <p>Here we solve all these problems by employing bounded states in the continuum (BICs) which represent special solutions of the wave equation whereby the wave function exhibits localization in a radiation band (13,14). In optical systems, BICs appear through interference between localized resonances and radiation modes, and they have been observed in the form of quasi-BIC in many systems ranging from isolated nanoparticles to periodic structures (14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19). In addition to ultra-high Q factors and low-threshold lasing, it was predicted that the BIC modes can possess vortex behaviors with different topological charges, important for vector beams (20)(21)(22). These findings make BICs very attractive for application in active photonics. Here we employ the specific characteristics of the topologically-protected optical BICs and demonstrate the ultrafast control of perovskite-based vortex microlasers at room temperatures.Here we solve all these problems by employing bounded states in the continuum (BICs) which represent special solutions of the wave equation whereby the wave function exhibits localization in a radiation band (13,14).

        <p>Our metasurface is created using a 220 nm lead bromide perovskite (MAPbBr3) film patterned with a square array of circular holes (Fig. 1A). The whole structure is placed on a glass substrate (nsub=1.5) and coated with PMMA (npmma=1.49). The radius of air holes is R=105 nm, and the lattice spacing is p=280 nm. We calculate the resonances of the transverse magnetic (TM) polarized field within the perovskite metasurface (Fig. 1B). The mode-1 has appreciable Q factor within the gain spectral range of MAPbBr3 perovskites (Fig. 1C). By changing the radius of the hole, we preserve the Q factor of the mode-1 throughout the operational range. This mode represents the topology-protected BIC with an embedded polarization vortex, which has been discussed previously (20,(23)(24)(25)(26).Our metasurface is created using a 220 nm lead bromide perovskite (MAPbBr3) film patterned with a square array of circular holes (Fig. 1A).

        <p>The perovskite metasurfaces was fabricated from MAPbBr3 with a combined process of electronbeam lithography and reactive ion etching (27). Figure 2A shows the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the sample. To realize the designed BIC vortex lasers, we optically pump the perovskite metasurface at room temperature with a frequency-doubled Ti: Sapphire laser. Figure 2B shows the evolution of the emission spectrum at different pumping densities.

        <p>With an increase of the pumping power, a single peak appears at 552 nm (being the resonant wavelength of the mode-1 in the normal direction) and quickly dominates the emission spectrum at higher pumping fluence.

        <p>The vortex characteristics of the emission are studied from the far-field angular distributions by the back-focal-plane imaging technique (27) (see Fig. 2). The intensity of perovskite laser emission is spatially distributed in a donut shape with a dark zone at the center (Fig. 2D). The dominant bright ring corresponds to the far-field angle of θFF=2 o . The dark center is caused by a topological singularity at the beam axis. Figure 2D shows the self-interference pattern of a donut beam (27), where a fork-shaped interference pattern can be seen. In the profiles of the donut beam behind a linear polarizer (Figs. 2E-2H), two lobes are observed and their direction follows with the axis of linear polarizer, demonstrating the radial polarization. These experimental results for the beam profiles, self-interference patterns, and polarization states confirm the onset of the vector vortex lasing at the BIC mode (28). The BIC vortex microlasers are robust to global changes. It has been reproduced for more than 10 samples (27), and it has proven to be robust to a change of the excitation power. The donut-shaped laser beams and fork-shaped interference patterns are well preserved from the laser threshold to gain saturation (see Fig. 2D).The vortex characteristics of the emission are studied from the far-field angular distributions by the back-focal-plane imaging technique (27) (see Fig. 2).

        <p>Vortex emission is typically produced by real-space chiral structures (9), which are absent in our experiment. Instead, in our system, the topology that protects the BICs manifests itself as the rotation of polarization along the beam axis in the far field (28,29). Acting alone, it impacts an OAM in the cross-polarized transmission of circularly polarized beams (29). Together with the transverse spin angular momentum introduced in real samples, we observe the emergence of the effective Pancharatnam-Berry phase (27).Vortex emission is typically produced by real-space chiral structures (9), which are absent in our experiment.

        <p>More interestingly, the laser emission at the symmetry protected BICs can be controlled alloptically. While the BIC lasers are robust to a global change, they are extremely sensitive to symmetry-breaking perturbations (14,21) and thus easily controllable. In passive systems, such a control is realized via a deformation of nanostructures (26) or the Kerr nonlinearity, which not suitable for post-fabrication control or require strong optical excitation. The laser systems can solve this problem in a simpler way. The exceptional gain corresponds to the imaginary part of refractive index (n"), which is a new parameter to control the symmetry. One example is illustrated in Fig. 1D and (27) where a regular change of n" of a laser system in a selected region can break the 4-fold rotational symmetry of the system. As a result, the resonance at the Γ-point degrades from BIC to quasi-BIC, and the corresponding Q factor is reduced by orders of magnitude. In this sense, the pumping geometry can provide more flexible approach to control the performance of the vortex BICs lasers.More interestingly, the laser emission at the symmetry protected BICs can be controlled alloptically.

        <p>To demonstrate this kind of all-optical control of the vortex microlasers, the perovskite metasurface is pumped with a circular laser beam, the symmetry is protected, and thus a donutshaped beam is generated (Fig. 3A). Once the pumping region is transferred from a circle to an ellipse (Fig. 3B), the symmetry protection becomes broken, and two linearly diffracted beams are produced (30). Similar symmetry-breaking can also be realized with a two-beam configuration. As depicted in Fig. 3C, one circular beam with density above a threshold (1.2 Pth) is applied onto the perovskite metasurface. The second circular beam with 0.8 Pth is pumped on the same sample with 10 µm lateral shift. The second beam does not produce laser emission but it could pump an overlapping region far above the threshold. In microlasers, a small change in the pumping density above a threshold can induce an appreciable variation in the gain coefficient. Consequently, the symmetry at BICs becomes broken, and two linearly polarized beams without OAM are generated along the radial direction (27).To demonstrate this kind of all-optical control of the vortex microlasers, the perovskite metasurface is pumped with a circular laser beam, the symmetry is protected, and thus a donutshaped beam is generated (Fig. 3A).

        <p>In addition to the spatial deviation, the two-beam configuration can also allow a time delay τ (Fig. 4A), which can record the temporal behavior of the transition process. To accurately characterize the switching time, we introduce the parameter K = (𝐼 1 -𝐼 2 )/𝐼 2 and study precisely its dependence on τ. Here I1,2 correspond to the intensities in the regions marked as 1 and 2 in Fig. 4A. When the nanostructure is pumped only by the first beam, the output is a uniform donut and the normalized ratio is K~0. Once the second beam overlaps temporally with the first beam, the optical symmetry becomes broken. Correspondingly, the intensity at region-2 decreases, almost vanishing (27) and giving the ratio of K~1 (see Fig. 4B). The switching time from a vortex lasing to a regular linearly polarized lasing is only about 1.5 ps. By changing the asymmetric pumping beam to a circular beam, the two linearly polarized beams can be switched back to the vortex lasers with a similar transition time ~ 1.5 ps (Fig. 4C).In addition to the spatial deviation, the two-beam configuration can also allow a time delay τ (Fig. 4A), which can record the temporal behavior of the transition process.

        <p>The switching "on" and "off" at the quasi-BIC mode is intrinsically different from the formation of short laser pulses. The latter is usually restricted by the build-up time and cannot repeat with a high speed. To illustrate directly this difference, we apply the third pump beam to recover the symmetry. As depicted in Fig. 4D, the donut-lobes-donut states can be combined within a single process. Thus the transition time is not limited. Because of a strong relationship between the output beam and the symmetry, the emission beam only has two states, i.e. donut and two lobes (27). Considering the transition time, such a binary transition is reliable for applications to all-optical switching.The switching "on" and "off" at the quasi-BIC mode is intrinsically different from the formation of short laser pulses.

        <p>Note that the transition time of the BIC lasers is orders of magnitude faster than that observed earlier for any conventional directly modulated microlasers and the lifetime of our BIC lasers (27). Such a surprising improvement is attributed to the far-field characteristics of BICs. In principle, the BICs are formed by destructive interference at the radiation channels. The transition from BIC vortex lasers to linear lasers represents a re-distribution of the laser emission instead of a direct switching of the lasing mode. In this sense, we don't need to wait for the rundown of an initial laser mode, and thus the trade-off between high-Q values (Q ∝ ωt, relates to a low threshold) and high-speed operation (∝1/t) can be broken. Nonlinear all-optical switching can have similar or even shorter transition time. But here the exceptional gain coefficient makes the energy consumption (122 W for peak power) orders of magnitude lower. We also notice that this approach allows to remove the fundamental limitation for microlasers, and the energy consumption can be further reduced by fully exploiting the extremely high Q factor at the BICs (18).Note that the transition time of the BIC lasers is orders of magnitude faster than that observed earlier for any conventional directly modulated microlasers and the lifetime of our BIC lasers (27).

The model is built with a unit cell, consisting of a square (with index of perovskite) hollowed out a round hole (with index of PMMA). Period boundary conditions in both are x and y directions and perfectly matched layers (PML) along the z-direction are constructed. The band structure is then calculated using eigen-frequency solver with gradual change of the angle of incidence. Figure S4 shows the TM (transverse magnetic, with E perpendicular to the plane) and TE (transverse electric, with E in plane) band structure near the Γpoint and the corresponding electric field, respectively. The green shading region is the spectrum range for an optical gain of perovskite film, and we can see that only TM1 mode could experience enough gain for the designed nanostructure. On the other hand, comparing the electric fields for the TE modes and TM modes, we observe that the electric field of the TM modes is confined with the perovskite film, while for the TE modes, the electric field is confined within the air hole.

It is easy to see that the wavelengths keep well. Therefore, compared with the wavelength shift and simple intensity measurement, the lasing actions that is closely related to the Q factors and the other characteristics can be a better candidate for monitoring and controlling BICs. shows the corresponding resonant wavelength, which also changes with the increase of the deformation parameter. This is different from the results of Figs. S5(a) and Fig.</p>

        <p>The light scattering from the perovskite metasurfaces has been described in the manuscript. Figure 2a in the main manuscript shows the evolution of the emission spectrum at different pumping densities. A broad spontaneous emission peak of lead halide centered at 520 nm is observed at low pumping density. With an increase of the pumping power, a narrow peak appears at 556 nm, and it quickly dominates the emission spectrum at higher pumping fluence. Figure 2b in the main text summarizes the output laser intensity as a function of the pumping density. A "S-shape" curve is observed in the log-log plot, demonstrating the transition from spontaneous emission to amplification and finally to gain saturation. Meanwhile, we also observe that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) reduces significantly from ~ 30 nm to 0.1 nm, which is the resolution limit of our spectrometer. All of these observations confirm the properties of perovskite generated by the periodic lattice. The threshold value is around 3.7 µJ/cm 2 , which is also consistent with previous reports on single-crystalline perovskite lasers. The variation in the sizes of dark zones in (b) is relatively random and is mainly caused by the pumping power and the imperfections of samples.The light scattering from the perovskite metasurfaces has been described in the manuscript.

        <p>Owing to the BIC effect, the single-mode laser operation is well preserved above the threshold. As shown in Fig. S7a, when pumping density is increased to 2*Pth, another laser peak ~554 nm appears besides the main laser peak ~552 nm. The calculated extinction ratio is more than 20 dB. These results show that the BIC vortex microlasers are quite robust to perturbations. We also show that the BIC laser and the vortex lasers can be repeated in many samples. Figure S7b shows the experimental results by changing the air radius from 105 nm to 70 nm. We observe the lasing wavelength redshift from 552 nm to 560 nm. Besides, the single-mode laser operation, the donut-shape beam in back-focal-plane and the fork-shaped interference pattern are all well preserved in these samples.Owing to the BIC effect, the single-mode laser operation is well preserved above the threshold.

        <p>The self-interference experimental setup is shown in Fig. S9, where modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer is used. A frequency doubled Ti:Sapphire laser light (400 nm, using a BBO crystal) from a regenerative amplifier (repetition rate 1 kHz, pulse width 100 fs, seeded by Mai Tai, Spectra Physics) is used to excite the sample. The sample is first pumped by the 400 nm femtosecond pulse laser through a 40x object lens, and then the emission is collected by a 20x object lens. The emitted laser beam is splitted into two donut beams (50:50) and reach the same observation plane via two different paths. Then the interference pattern could be monitored by a CCD camera. In order to ensure a temporal overlap between the two paths, one of the paths is adjusted One interesting question is about the relationship between the input beam and output laser beam. To check this relationship, we change the incident beam from a circle to hexagon, pentagon, and square with a spatial light modulator (SLM). As shown in Fig. S13 below, no matter the pumping profile is circle or square, the output beams always have donut-ring shapes. Only when the system is pumped with a stripe, the output beam changes to two lobes. This kind of a binary transition is consistent with the theoretical model for the generation of vector vortex beam. The real system is determined by the pumping profile with a finite size. In the case of circular to square pumping profiles, the overall symmetry is larger than 2-fold rotational symmetry. As the result, the singlet at the Γ-point is maintained at the BIC conditions with winding structures in the momentum space. Once the pumping profile changes to a stripe or ellipse, the rotational symmetry becomes 2-fold and the resonance quickly degrades from the BIC conditions.The self-interference experimental setup is shown in Fig. S9, where modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer is used.

        <p>We have also studied the variation of output beam profile as a function of incident beam profile. Here we use an elliptical beam with semi-major (b) and semi-minor axes (a). Figure S14 shows the intensity in region 2 of Fig. 4 of the main text. When the pump profile changes from the symmetric case, the output quickly degrades to two lobes. This is also consistent with the topologically protected BIC emission well. Note that the transition between donut and two lobes mainly utilizes the decay channels at BICs. It is not limited within vortex microlaser and can be extended to other emissions such as vector microlasers.We have also studied the variation of output beam profile as a function of incident beam profile.

        <p>In the manuscript, we demonstrate that the symmetry-breaking perturbations of the Γ-point BIC would influence the far-field emission pattern. The key information is that the transition time is only 1-1.5 ps (orders of magnitude faster than directly modulated microlasers) while the pumping power is orders of magnitude lower than that for nonlinear optical switching. Such a kind of impressive results come from the far-field characteristics of the optical BICs, which makes the system is independent to the lifetime of the initial laser mode. Therefore, it is also important to confirm experimentally that the initial laser can last longer than 1.5 ps and the trade-off is indeed broken. In order to confirm this, we study the transient absorption of the BICs microlasers.In the manuscript, we demonstrate that the symmetry-breaking perturbations of the Γ-point BIC would influence the far-field emission pattern.

        <p>The working principle is that the transient absorption at the lasing wavelength is closely related to the population inversion. A transient absorption curve can reflect the population on the upper level and the corresponding lifetime. With a similar pumpprobe setup, the lifetime of our BIC vortex laser has been recorded, and it is shown in Fig. S15. It is easy to see that the transition ∆T/T decreases exponentially with the delay time τ. The fitted experimental curve shows that the lifetime is around 85 ps. This value is consistent with the previously reported measurement with the commercial systems 36 , and it is much longer than the transition time from the vortex to linear polarization beam.The working principle is that the transient absorption at the lasing wavelength is closely related to the population inversion.
