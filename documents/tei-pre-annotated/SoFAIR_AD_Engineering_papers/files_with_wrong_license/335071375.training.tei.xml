        <p>Satellite communication system is expected to play a vital role for realizing various remote internet of things (IoT) applications in 6G vision. Due to unique characteristics of satellite environment, one of the main challenges in this system is to accommodate massive random access (RA) requests of IoT devices while minimizing their energy consumptions. In this paper, we focus on the reliable design and detection of RA preamble to effectively enhance the access efficiency in highdynamic low-earth-orbit (LEO) scenarios. To avoid additional signaling overhead and detection process, a long preamble sequence is constructed by concatenating the conjugated and circularly shifted replicas of a single root Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence in RA procedure. Moreover, we propose a novel impulse-like timing metric based on length-alterable differential cross-correlation (LDCC), that is immune to carrier frequency offset (CFO) and capable of mitigating the impact of noise on timing estimation. Statistical analysis of the proposed metric reveals that increasing correlation length can obviously promote the output signal-to-noise power ratio, and the first-path detection threshold is independent of noise statistics. Simulation results in different LEO scenarios validate the robustness of the proposed method to severe channel distortion, and show that our method can achieve significant performance enhancement in terms of timing estimation accuracy, success probability of first access, and mean normalized access energy, compared with the existing RA methods.Satellite communication system is expected to play a vital role for realizing various remote internet of things (IoT) applications in 6G vision.

        <p>To perform uplink data transmission, each IoT device needs to initiate a random access (RA) procedure for network connection with the base station. When a device attempts to access the base station, it randomly selects one of the available preambles from the given preamble set to transmit on a RA time slot. Upon successful detection of the preamble sequences, the base station allocates the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) resources 1 and replies the RA response messages to the corresponding devices in the subsequent step of RA procedure. However, different from the terrestrial communication scenarios, a massive number of devices exist in the satellite beam with a wider coverage, they usually initiate simultaneous access requests to the loadlimited satellite receiver for emergency alarm and status report [6]. In this case, severe preamble collision and congestion will unavoidably occur, leading to frequently access retries and extra time spent on the RA procedure for the collided devices, which causes additional energy consumptions to their already limited energy supplies. It is therefore imperative to study how to improve the access efficiency of IoT devices to minimize the energy consumption in satellite communication scenarios.To perform uplink data transmission, each IoT device needs to initiate a random access (RA) procedure for network connection with the base station.

        <p>There have been a limited works focusing on designing energy-efficient RA schemes [7]- [13], in which the aforementioned RA overload problem, caused by the deficient contention resource of preambles and PUSCHs, was regarded as the main driver of energy consumption. The solutions to this problem can be categorized into preamble collision mitigation, access class control, resource allocation, as well as power control, all of which, nevertheless, are dependent on the premise of a successful preamble detection at the first step of RA procedure. However, this fundamental premise may not be guaranteed by taking into account the unique characteristics of LEO satellite environment, such as wide beam coverage, long propagation distance, and rapid relative movement between satellite and ground, which bring great challenges in effective design and detection of RA preamble.There have been a limited works focusing on designing energy-efficient RA schemes [7]- [13], in which the aforementioned RA overload problem, caused by the deficient contention resource of preambles and PUSCHs, was regarded as the main driver of energy consumption.

        <p>With the massive footprint of a satellite beam, the length of preamble must be sufficiently extended to absorb the significantly increased propagation delay, compared to that in terrestrial scenarios. Such that, the durations of cyclic prefix (CP) and guard time (GT) should be lengthened for the intersymbol interference (ISI) avoidance among the adjacent subframes, and in the meanwhile, a longer preamble sequence is also required to fulfill the requirements of coverage performance. With the long propagation distance resulting in a high path loss, the preamble detection process should work reliably in the conditions of low received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Besides, the rapid relative movement between LEO satellite and IoT device signifies a high-dynamic communication environment, and thus can give rise to the considerable Doppler shift and channel dispersion, which requires the preamble detection method be capable of having the robustness to large carrier frequency offset (CFO) and multi-path effect. Given the above, special attention should be paid to the reasonable design and reliable detection of RA preamble for LEO satellite-based IoT communications.With the massive footprint of a satellite beam, the length of preamble must be sufficiently extended to absorb the significantly increased propagation delay, compared to that in terrestrial scenarios.

        <p>With regard to this critical issue, some preamble design and detection methods presented in long term evolution (LTE)satellite systems [14], [15] could be considered for reference. In [16], He et al. leveraged the preamble design principles in LTE [17] to estimate the differential round trip delay and then compensated it before preamble transmission, such that both the durations of CP and GT can be greatly reduced. Even though, the sequence duration has to be lengthened in large scale to provide a sufficient beam coverage, which results in a small sub-carrier interval of RA preamble more vulnerable to large CFO. By considering the system compatibility, Li et al. [18] proposed to cascade the same terrestrial Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences to constitute the preamble sequence. Although the fractional timing advance (TA) could be effectively achieved, an extra preamble is required to transmit for determining the integral TA. In [19], Zhen et al. further designed a long preamble sequence based on multiple short sequences generated by cyclic shifting a root ZC sequence with large sub-carrier spacing, so that both the fractional and integral TA of each user can be determined by performing once power delay profile (PDP) calculation, which notably improves both the access efficiency and performance. However, the fractional and integral TA values need to be estimated separately, and the residual CFO will also lead to a decline of timing estimation accuracy. In addition, the methods in [20] and [21] presented to exploit the conjugate-symmetric ZC sequences to eliminate the impact of integral CFO on timing estimation, but both methods suffered from the obvious performance degradation in the presence of fractional CFO. Recently, 3GPP had offered some potential solutions in preamble design for 5G integrated satellite network [22], wherein Gold/m-sequence was considered as one of the candidate preamble sequences. Nevertheless, the additional processing procedures are indispensable, and thus a high computational complexity will be introduced that may be difficult to sustain for the load-limited satellite receiver.With regard to this critical issue, some preamble design and detection methods presented in long term evolution (LTE)satellite systems [14], [15] could be considered for reference.

        <p>It is foreseen from the features of 6G-enabled IoT communications [23]- [25] that, RA procedure is one of the most frequently used and energy consuming operations in devices. As the foremost step in RA procedure, an appropriate design and effective detection of RA preamble can remarkably enhance the success probability of first access, and is consequently conducive to reducing both the energy consumption and average access delay, so as to improve the access efficiency for massive IoT devices. However, the assumption of perfect preamble detection in the existing energy-efficient RA schemes might be too optimistic by considering the complicated and changeable LEO satellite environments, which make the previously presented preamble design and detection methods for pute satellite line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios no longer applicable. In consequence, a more reliable one with the robustness to severe channel distortion is required for energy-efficient RA procedure, especially in LEO satellite-based IoT. Inspired by this fact, we are dedicated to developing a new RA preamble and the corresponding timing detection method with the aims of achieving the resistivity to CFO, the mitigation of noise, as well as the insensitivity to channel dispersion.

        <p>1) We propose an enhanced single-root cascaded long sequence (E-SCLS). By only replacing the first subsequence of SCLS [19] to its conjugate form, it absolutely inherits the advantage of SCLS in supporting coverage extension, and more importantly, can achieve one-step TA estimation by directly detecting the elaborate conjugate root sequence without additional signaling overhead and detection process. 2) We present a novel timing metric according to the construction features of E-SCLS. Specifically, by jointly utilizing the starting two sub-sequences of E-SCLS, a length-alterable differential cross-correlation (LDCC) with an impulse-like shape, instead of the conventional periodical correlation, is designed as the correlation function, which not only is immune to CFO, but also can take advantage of the whole correlation products between the two sequences. 3) We investigate the statistical properties of the proposed timing metric for different classifications of timing positions within the detection window. It is found that our timing metric with a flexibly adjusted correlation length is capable of effectively restraining the adverse impact of noise on timing estimation, and the detection threshold used to accurately track the first arrival path can be easily determined with no need for noise variance estimation. 4) We validate the feasibility of the proposed timing estimation method in different LEO satellite channels, from the aspects of timing mean square error, success probability of first access, and mean normalized access energy. We further analyze and compare the characteristics of our methods in [19] and in this paper, and give suggestions on choosing a more appropriate method according to the actual communication scenario parameters, e.g. user location and elevation angle. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We describe the RA preamble design in satellite environments and formulate the received signal model in Section II. Section III elaborates the proposed E-SCLS, the timing metric based on LDCC as well as its statistical analysis. Numerical results and discussions are presented in Section IV.

        <p>RA preamble is used for user identification and TA estimation, which usually has an uniform time-domain structure in terrestrial communication systems. Because of the long propagation delay and large beam radius, the maximum differential round trip delay can reach to several milliseconds in satellite scenarios, which can be hundred times longer than that in terrestrial scenarios. Such that, the preamble duration should be greatly enlarged to cope with the time uncertainty, causing an obvious increment in detection complexity. Besides, the more noteworthy problem is the high sensitivity of RA preamble to Doppler and other sources of CFO. Since the subcarrier spacing is the reciprocal of sequence duration, it would be substantially compressed in regard to a long sequence, leading to a significant timing performance degradation in the presence of large CFOs. Therefore, it is necessary to design a more appropriate preamble format for the load-limited satellite communication systems.RA preamble is used for user identification and TA estimation, which usually has an uniform time-domain structure in terrestrial communication systems.

        <p>For this purpose, we had proposed an enhanced RA preamble format in our previous work [19], wherein the long sequence is constructed by concatenating a string of short sequences immune to CFO. By effectively designing the subcarrier spacing of short sequence in terms of the maximum Doppler shift related to the user mobility2 , the adverse impact of CFO on preamble detection can be mitigated in advance. In this case, the cascaded sequence not only can satisfy the coverage requirements within the beam, but also achieves the CFO-mitigation capability. Specifically, let us denote the durations of long sequence and short sequence as T LS and T SS , respectively, K = ⌊T LS /T SS ⌋ time-domain short sequences are utilized to construct the long sequence, while ZC sequences are chosen to generate the short sequence defined as S n = exp[-jπun(n + 1)/N ] for 0 ≤ n ≤ N -1, where u ∈ {1, . . ., N -1} is the root index and N denotes the sequence length.

        <p>SCLS comprises of a root ZC sequence and its cyclic shifted replicas. As aforementioned, the detection performance degradation for the long sequence may occur in the presence of large CFOs, strong noise, and serious channel dispersion. This undesirable result is mainly caused by the non-uniqueness of captured correlation peaks since each sub-sequence in SCLS employs the same root index. Moreover, it can be found that the value of TA is actually corresponding to the propagation delay of the first sub-sequence in the received RA preamble. Therefore, a feasible solution is to improve the sequence component of SCLS to make the first sub-sequence obviously different from the others, so as to extract a unique and correct correlation peak in the PDP detection window.SCLS comprises of a root ZC sequence and its cyclic shifted replicas.

        <p>According to the structure characteristics of the proposed E-SCLS, TA estimation is actually to determine the time index corresponding to the start of the received conjugate root sequence. Towards this end, the corresponding timing detection method for E-SCLS should be able to achieve a unique and distinct correlation peak at the desired timing position, which is easily captured in the detection window and could be further utilized for correct timing estimation. However, the high sensitivity of ZC sequence to large CFO makes this target greatly challenging [27], [28], especially for the LEO satellite scenario with high Doppler shift and unpredictable oscillator error.According to the structure characteristics of the proposed E-SCLS, TA estimation is actually to determine the time index corresponding to the start of the received conjugate root sequence.

        <p>There are two major solutions to cope with the adverse influence of large CFO: 1) Setting larger sub-carrier spacing for physical RA channel (PRACH) based on the maximum Doppler shift [19]. Since ZC sequence is capable of resisting to CFO less than half a sub-carrier interval, if the sub-carrier interval is set to be greater than or equal to two times of maximum Doppler shift, the impact of CFO on timing detection can be restrained in advance. 2) Using the conjugate-symmetric ZC sequences [20], [21]. By combining a root ZC sequence with its conjugate sequence to construct the preamble sequence, the integral CFO can be effectively eliminated because the effects of integral CFO on the two correlation peaks are just the opposite. Unlike existing solutions that adopt conventional periodical correlation as timing metric, our solution takes a further step by designing a novel timing metric with the robustness to CFO.There are two major solutions to cope with the adverse influence of large CFO: 1) Setting larger sub-carrier spacing for physical RA channel (PRACH) based on the maximum Doppler shift [19].

        <p>To clarify, we further depict the magnitude of the DCCbased timing metric under a noiseless LOS channel for different normalized CFOs in Fig. 3, where the parameters K, N , h l , and τ are set as 3, 839, 1, 1200, respectively. It can be observed that, even if CFO is larger than one subcarrier interval, the magnitude of timing metric still obtains its maximum value at the correct timing position, and meanwhile, is not affected by the varying CFOs. Nevertheless, its timing curve has a triangle shape, and the peak difference between adjacent positions is great small. This is due to the specific characteristics of ZC sequence that the differential vector generated by one single ZC sequence will no longer possess perfect zero auto-correlation property, and thus its timing metric is not a impulse-like shape as expected. It is foreseeable that the timing estimation of single ZC sequence based DCC is highly susceptible to noise and multi-path effect, and will suffer from serious performance degradation when applied to the poor satellite environment with low received SNRs and severe channel dispersion. Based on the above analysis, we focus attention on designing a more robust timing detection function with a notably distinguishable correlation peak, which not only can resist to large CFO, but also is capable of mitigation of noise.To clarify, we further depict the magnitude of the DCCbased timing metric under a noiseless LOS channel for different normalized CFOs in Fig. 3, where the parameters K, N , h l , and τ are set as 3, 839, 1, 1200, respectively.

        <p>2) Wrong timing position: According to the statistical analysis at the correct timing position, the proposed timing metric is verified to be able to effectively restrain the adverse impacts of large CFO and noise on preamble detection. However, in some scenarios with severe channel dispersion (e.g. the device is located at a densely built city with a small elevation angle), it may not work well because the strongest path corresponding to the maximum correlation peak may not be the first one, leading to a significant decrease in timing estimation accuracy. To resolve this problem, a pre-set detection threshold is required to track the time instants corresponding to the arriving paths, while to make correlation results of the other instants below it with an extremely high probability. Towards this end, we first conduct statistical analysis of the proposed timing metric at the wrong timing positions, and then design the first-path detection threshold in terms of the target false alarm probability.2) Wrong timing position: According to the statistical analysis at the correct timing position, the proposed timing metric is verified to be able to effectively restrain the adverse impacts of large CFO and noise on preamble detection.

        <p>To assess the timing performance of our method by computer simulation, we consider a 5G-enabled LEO satellite RA scenario reported in the latest 3GPP TR 38.821 [22], and Table I lists the detailed configurations of system parameters. In this scenario, the max differential delay is 1.7 ms, and thus the CP duration T CP must be greater than or equal to twice of this value to avoid ISI, such that we set T CP to be 3.4 ms. To satisfy the coverage performance within the beam, the duration of E-SCLS, T LS , is calculated based on the link budget [17] as 6.4 ms. In consideration of system compatibility, the subcarrier interval is set to be the value adopted in LTE/NR PRACH, i.e. 1.25 KHz, and consequently the duration T SEQ of sub-sequence of E-SCLS is 0.8 ms. That is to say, the proposed E-SCLS consists of K = 8 short ZC sequences with length of N = 839. Further, for preamble sequence design, the root index u can be flexibly chosen from the set {1, 839}, and the cyclic shift offset N CS is configured to be 101. Here, both AWGN and frequency selective fading (FSF) channels are utilized for performance evaluation of the proposed method.To assess the timing performance of our method by computer simulation, we consider a 5G-enabled LEO satellite RA scenario reported in the latest 3GPP TR 38.821 [22], and Table I lists the detailed configurations of system parameters.

        <p>First, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method in AWGN channel, so as to validate the effectiveness of theoretical analysis in Section III. In Fig. 6, we show the simulated and analytical results of the output power ratio of signal to noise, β, for different number of correlation rows, M 0 . We notice that the numerical results nearly coincide with the analytical results for different M 0 , which demonstrates the validity of statistical derivation at the correct timing position, and the inappreciable difference between them for the same M 0 is mainly due to the approximation of the noise statistics. Furthermore, it can be also seen from Fig. 6 that, β is always larger than 1 and merely increases with the number of correlation rows, which fully shows that the noise-mitigation capability of the proposed method can be further enhanced with the increment of the number of correlation rows. We adopt the mean square error (MSE) as the evaluative criteria of timing estimation, and investigate the timing performance of our method versus SNR with different correlation lengths used in LDCC. As shown in Fig. 7, the timing accuracy gradually enhances with the increment of correlation length, since the proposed timing metric with larger M is able to obtain a better anti-noise capability. Moreover, it is evident that the amplitude gain between the MSE curves with different M becomes higher as SNR increases, for instance, the gain between two MSE curves with M = 16 and M = 1 can reach to be greater than 10 3 at SNR = -10 dB. That is to say, our method can achieve a significantly improved the timing estimation performance by increasing the correlation length. Here, it is worth noting that computational complexity is also one of the key issues in the practical implement of the satellite station. If the complexity is the main concern, we could choose relatively less correlation rows in LDCC, e.g. M = 1 or M = 2; otherwise, we configure M = 4 or M = 8 for achieving a better timing estimation performance, on condition that the system can afford such complexity.First, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method in AWGN channel, so as to validate the effectiveness of theoretical analysis in Section III.

Notice that the preamble designs of the referenced methods are based on the system parameters listed in Table I.

Here, the residual CFO is 250 Hz after frequency compensation, and the target false alarm probability is set to be the same value specified in 5G RA, i.e. 10 -3 . It can be seen from Fig. 9 that, since the timing estimation performance in [16] with small sub-carrier spacing is greatly affected by CFO, this method suffers from a considerable timing error at different SNRs. By reusing the terrestrial 5G RA preamble format in [18] and [19], both methods have a relatively larger sub-carrier interval compared to that in [16], and thus could be effectively used for tracking the first and strongest arrival path in satellite LOS scenario. It is notable that, the timing estimation performance of the proposed method can be continuously improved by increasing the correlation length.

        <p>Further, we compare the timing MSE performance of the aforementioned methods under a 4-paths Rayleigh channel in Fig. 10. Here, the CFO and the target false alarm probability are set as 0 and 10 -3 , respectively. Note that all the methods have high timing errors at extremely low SNRs; however, with the increment of SNR, the influence of multipath effect dominates, which may greatly affect their timing estimation performance. To be specific, there is no further performance improvement for the methods in [18] and [19] when SNR &gt; -10 dB. This is because both methods can only indicate the strongest LOS path, which is not the first arriving path in this satellite NLOS scenario. On the contrary, due to the reasonable design of detection threshold, the proposed method can effectively track the first path, and consequently obtain a much better timing accuracy in contrast with the conventional methods. Again, its performance is also improved as the correlation length increases. As we know, the success probability of channel access is one of vital evaluation criteria of access efficiency in satellite RA, which can be utilized to indicate energy efficiency [36], [37] and access delay. To demonstrate the performance benefit of channel access success probability, we compare the proposed method with our earlier method given in [19], wherein CFO is set to 0 for fair comparison. As shown in Fig. 11, it is observed that our method in [19] could achieve an acceptable success probabilities in both AWGN channel and 7-paths Rician channel. However, in the 4-paths Rayleigh channel, its performance is extremely degraded due to the existence of stronger scattering paths. By contrast, attributable to the efficient resistance of multi-path effect, the proposed method has an obviously higher success probabilities in different channel conditions.Further, we compare the timing MSE performance of the aforementioned methods under a 4-paths Rayleigh channel in Fig. 10.

        <p>We shall now evaluate the energy efficiency of our proposed method. The energy efficiency of our proposed method is directly due to the high access probability which keeps the number of attempts for a successful channel access low. We show the mean normalized access energy for each method, which is the energy consumption for the channel access normalized to the energy consumption of a single access. The average energy consumed for a successful channel access depends on the access probability. Since each channel access attempt is independent, the channel access attempt can be described by a Geometric process, and mean number of attempts for a success access can be determined. Given that each channel access consumes the same energy, the mean number of a successful attempt can be used directly to describe the mean normalized energy consumption [38]. To illustrate the energy efficiency of the proposed method in various satellite environments, we again compare the proposed method with our previously presented method [19] for different channel conditions in Fig. 12. Likewise, CFO is set to 0 for fair comparison. We immediately see adequately low normalized energy consumption for the proposed scheme for the channel access. The results further indicate that the proposed method can be applied to various satellite environments, regardless of severe channel dispersion.We shall now evaluate the energy efficiency of our proposed method.

        <p>As shown in Table II, by adopting SCLS as the preamble sequence, our previous method only uses the least root ZC sequences for generating all the available sequences, and thus On the other hand, for the proposed method that adopts E-SCLS, each available RA preamble has its own root ZC sequence, and consequently a larger number of root sequences is required to generate all the available sequences. Such that, a relatively higher detection complexity is achieved compared with that in [19], since each used root sequence needs one time correlation detection. Meanwhile, in the case of massive users access, interference-suppression capability of the proposed method gradually weakens as the number of users increases. Nevertheless, because the timing metric based on LDCC is not only robust to CFO, but also has a the flexibly adjusted correlation length, while considering the elaborately design of first-path detection threshold that independent of noise statistics, the proposed method is distinctly superior to [19] in terms of CFO-resistance capability, noise-mitigation capability, and anti-multipath fading capability.As shown in Table II, by adopting SCLS as the preamble sequence, our previous method only uses the least root ZC sequences for generating all the available sequences, and thus On the other hand, for the proposed method that adopts E-SCLS, each available RA preamble has its own root ZC sequence, and consequently a larger number of root sequences is required to generate all the available sequences.

For instance, if the access device is located at a country/suburban or has a large elevation angle, LOS path exists and Doppler shift is relatively lower, the previous method could be chosen for RA preamble design and detection; in case the access device is located at a densely built city or has a small elevation angle, NLOS scenario with large Doppler shift may occur, it is more reliable to choose the proposed method in this paper.In summation, according to the actual communication scenario parameters (such as user location, elevation angle, and etc.) and the available computing resources, the satellite receiver can adaptively choose an appropriate method based on the own unique advantages of two methods.

        <p>In this paper, we focused on the robust design and detection of RA preamble for high-efficiency LEO satellite-assisted 6G IoT. First, we proposed an enhanced preamble sequence, referring to as E-SCLS, by concatenating the conjugated and circularly shifted replicas of a single root ZC sequence, so as to perform one-step TA estimation to avoid additional signaling overhead and detection procedure. Then, we presented a novel timing metric based on LDCC that can achieve the immunity to CFO and mitigation of noise, and revealed its superiority according to the statistical analysis at the correct timing index. We further derived the first-path detection threshold according to the target false alarm probability and finally showed the proposed timing estimation method for satellite multi-path fading channels.In this paper, we focused on the robust design and detection of RA preamble for high-efficiency LEO satellite-assisted 6G IoT.

        <p>Numerical results in different LEO scenarios validated the effectiveness of statistical analysis, and demonstrated that the proposed method with the robustness to severe channel distortion can significantly improve both the access performance and efficiency as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of timing MSE, success probability of first access, and mean normalized access energy. Moreover, we have also summarized the characteristics of our methods in [19] and in this paper, and given suggestions with respect to choosing a more appropriate method based on the actual communication scenario parameters. Note that, since each available preamble employs an individual root ZC sequence in the proposed method, the utilization of extra root sequences will introduce a high detection complexity as well as non-orthogonal interference in the case of massive access. In the future work, it is of great interest to further design the related successive interference cancellation (SIC) method with an acceptable complexity.Numerical results in different LEO scenarios validated the effectiveness of statistical analysis, and demonstrated that the proposed method with the robustness to severe channel distortion can significantly improve both the access performance and efficiency as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of timing MSE, success probability of first access, and mean normalized access energy.

        <p>It is notable that, once the orbit parameters of an LEO satellite are determined, the Doppler shift corresponding to the movement of the satellite can be basically estimated and compensated for. Hence, we considered CFO to be the Doppler shift that caused mainly by the movement of user in[19].It is notable that, once the orbit parameters of an LEO satellite are determined, the Doppler shift corresponding to the movement of the satellite can be basically estimated and compensated for.

        <p>By using the piecewise cumulative detection in[19], multiple peaks with different locations can be obtained in once periodical correlation operation, which can be further used to estimate the fractional and integral values of TA, respectively. However, peak shifts will inevitably occur if the scattering path dominates, leading to the decline of TA estimation accuracy.By using the piecewise cumulative detection in[19], multiple peaks with different locations can be obtained in once periodical correlation operation, which can be further used to estimate the fractional and integral values of TA, respectively.
