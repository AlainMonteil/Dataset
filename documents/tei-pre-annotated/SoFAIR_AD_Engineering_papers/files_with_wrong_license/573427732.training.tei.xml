        <p>Digitally-enabled sustainable supply chains provide both challenges and opportunities.</p>
        <p>• The state-of-the-art regarding digitallyenabled sustainable supply chains is still to be presented. • A systematisation of the knowledge in this field is presented with a focus on big data. • A research agenda containing pressing research gaps is presented.</p>
        <p>It is generally accepted that emerging digital technologies can enhance firms' performance (Dubey et al., 2019;Fosso-Wamba et al., 2015) as well as the performance of supply chains around the globe (Rai et al., 2006;Govindan et al., 2018). While the potential benefits of integrating digital technologies and supply chain management have been widely reported by both academics and practitioners (Wang et al., 2016;Kamble et al., 2020), less is known regarding the current state-of-the-art literature on digitally-enabled sustainable supply chains, and in particular regarding big data analytics. Understanding the current status of knowledge concerning digitally enabled sustainable supply chains with a focus on big data analytics is a relevant priority for a number of reasons:</p>
        <p>-First, the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as 'industry 4.0', have the potential to re-shape operations and supply chain management (Govindan et al., 2018). New information technologies (IT), such as advancements related to big data (BD), have the potential to create more successful supply chains (Rai et al., 2006) and firms (Dubey et al., 2019). -Sustainability in supply chains is considered a key component of contemporary and socially responsible supply chains. Any discussion of supply chain management which does not consider the sustainability component would be incomplete.</p>
        <p>In this work, the use of big data analysis in digitally-enabled sustainable supply chains is defined as the application of a wide range of emerging industry 4.0 technologies to unleash the full potential of supply chains (SC), which, through the use of large amounts of data in decision-making processes, thus transform themselves into supply chains which are technologically advanced, socially responsible, environmentally-friendly (Song et al., 2017a(Song et al., , 2017b)), and economically successful. This definition is inspired by a blending of the following classic concepts:</p>
        <p>-Digitally-enabled supply chain management: IT-powered supply chain management operating through new digital platforms and technologies (Rai et al., 2006). -Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM): according to the classic work of Seuring andMüller, (2008, p.1700), 'sustainable supply chain management as the management of material, information and capital flows as well as cooperation among companies along the supply chain while taking goals from all three dimensions of sustainable development, i.e., economic, environmental and social, into account which are derived from customer and stakeholder requirements'. -Digitally-enabled industry 4.0: also known as the fourth industrial revolution, this phenomenon is related to the latest transformations in manufacturing due to the emergence of digitalization and extensive connectivity between cyber-physical systems. -Big-data predictive analytics (BDPA): 'the ability to access, analyse and manage vast volumes of data with the support of robust information architecture' (Dubey et al., 2019, p.341). Big data has unique characteristics such as the four V's: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity (Jabbour et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>In this context, the innovations and emerging technologies of industry 4.0, such as big data, offer great opportunities to promote sustainable practices in supply chains (Govindan et al., 2018;Moeuf et al., 2018). Corbett (2018) adds that big data creates revolutionary new possibilities for the sustainable management of supply chains' impacts. However, Kamble et al. (2020) highlight that there is a need to better understand how sustainable performance in SC can be achieved in a data-driven environment. Thus, the question which motivates this article is: what do we know about the use of big data in digitally-enabled sustainable supply chains? Thereby, this paper aims to extend the understanding of digitally-enabled sustainable supply chains by systematising published studies addressing the implications of big data.</p>
        <p>The research methodology adopted in this study is a systematic literature review, with our chosen approach following the procedures of other recent works (Jabbour et al., 2019;Gaur and Kumar, 2018;Lu et al., 2018). This approach combines an overview of the relevant literature by means of bibliometric research (Fahimnia et al., 2015) and content analysis to propose relevant lessons and future research directions (Bhimani et al., 2019;Gaur and Kumar, 2018).</p>
        <p>The articles included in this study were identified through searches performed in the Scopus database. The Scopus database is among the most widely used and recognised academic databases in the world (Harzing and Alakangas, 2016), indexing around 70% more sources than the Web of Science (Brzezinski, 2015). These searches were conducted using the title, abstract and keyword options by applying the following query and Boolean operators:</p>
        <p>• TITLE-ABS-KEY ("big data") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY ("sustainab*") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("green") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY ("supply chain").</p>
        <p>To provide robustness in our approach, we adopted a review protocol as suggested by Lu et al. (2018). Fig. 1 summarises the criteria and selection protocol. The initial search returned 113 documents, including journal articles, book chapters, conference papers, editorials, short surveys and review articles. The year of publication was not specified in the search. In order to refine the initial sample, we selected only journal articles and reviews, and specified papers written in English. After this step, 64 papers remained. Next, each of these papers was read indepth and only those identified as being relevant in responding to the defined research question were selected. Ultimately, 33 publications remained in the sample. The time span covered by these articles runs from 2015 until December 2019.</p>
        <p>After defining the final sample, a coding scheme was adopted to extract and systematise the relevant information from the publications through content analysis. This classification scheme was based on previous reviews (Gaur and Kumar, 2018;Jabbour, 2013) and comprised the following categories:</p>
        <p>• Context analysed in the study: this concerns the country analysed in the article, classified either as a developing or developed economy; • Main purpose of the research: this relates to the main research objective of the analysed article; • Method: this refers to the methodological approach used in the paper;</p>
        <p>• TBL elements involved: the triple-bottom-line refers to the simultaneous consideration of economic, social, and environmental benefits (Elkington, 1994); • Supply chain economic sector: this regards to the specific economic sector analysed in the study; • Integration with other Industry 4.0 technologies: this concerns the involvement of other industry 4.0-related technologies, such as internet of things, blockchain, cloud computing, among others, in conjunction with big data for SSCM; • Underpinning theory: this relates to the use of specific organizational theories to support the study's findings;</p>
        <p>• Potential implications for big data-driven sustainable supply chain:</p>
        <p>each selected paper provides a potential lesson regarding the use of big data analytics in managing sustainable supply chains.</p>
        <p>Therefore, this step of the systematic review was used to deepen understanding on the relationship between big data analytics and SSCM, to systematise and assess the main categories discussed, and to identify avenues for future research.</p>
        <p>-Systematise published works addressing the implications of big data for sustainable supply chain management.</p>
        <p>-Synthesise existing knowledge on big data and sustainable supply chains -Clarify the main lessons learned from the extant literature -Identify avenues for future research</p>
        <p>big data AND sustainab* OR green AND supply chain</p>
        <p>2015 to December 2019 (not specified in the search)</p>
        <p>-Non English articles -Non journal articles -Articles not related to big data, supply chain, and sustainability</p>
        <p>Total: 33 3. Results and discussion: current lessons and future research avenues for big data-driven SSCM</p>
        <p>In this section, our analyses of the results and relevant discussions will be presented. Appendix A provides a detailed summary of the articles reviewed. First, we present the results of the bibliometric analysis to provide a panoramic perspective on the topic. Next, the content analysis findings are displayed, diving into discussions of the literature and presenting gaps and lessons.</p>
        <p>Fig. 2 presents the chronological distribution of the publications analysed. This shows a growing trend in papers addressing big data and sustainable supply chains. The peak was reached in 2019, with 13 articles, while the first paper dates from 2015. This is aligned with Zhao et al. (2017), who argue that there is a long way to go concerning the integration of big data science and sustainable supply chain management. In addition, although this search was conducted in 2019, there are already 4 publications dated 2020. Therefore, big data analytics and sustainable supply chain are increasingly prevalent concepts in the literature, which reveals growing interest in the topic.</p>
        <p>The principal publishing location of the articles analysed is Journal of Cleaner Production (8 publications), followed by Sustainability (3), Computers and Operations Research (2), International Journal of Production Economics (2), Resources Conservation and Recycling (2) and Technological Forecasting and Social Change (2). Fig. 3 presents the distribution of the relevant journals according to subject area. Journals in the fields of business, management and accounting are the most common (22%), followed by engineering journals (18.7%), environmental science (14.3%) and energy (12.1%). Despite the fact that the majority of the studies appeared in journals related to business, management and engineering, Fig. 3 shows that there are many different fields contributing to developing the literature on the application of big data analytics for SSCM.</p>
        <p>According to Fig. 4, the most commonly used methodological approach in the analysed articles is the quantitative approach, followed by qualitative and conceptual papers. Notably, only 17.6% of the sample adopted a modelling approach. Specifically, few of these studies applied big data to model sustainable supply chains. This is aligned with Kaur and Singh (2018), who assert that despite the huge potential of using big data for optimization and modelling, very few attempts have been made so far to develop supply chain models for sustainability using big data (Kaur and Singh, 2018;Xu et al., 2019;Jiao et al., 2018;Zhao et al., 2017). This finding led to our first recommendation:</p>
        <p>Gap 1. : To push forward efforts in using big data to model sustainable supply chains. Fig. 5 presents the number of publications that address BDPA for SSCM, integrating other industry 4.0 technologies. Although there are several emerging digital technologies from industry 4.0, which are frequently combined to create a digitally-enabled supply chain, 23 out of the 33 papers analysed only address the application of big data, without considering different technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) was integrated with big data analytics in 9 articles, with blockchain appearing in 5 publications. According to Zhang et al. (2020), blockchain technology can serve as a bridge to connect IoT technologies with big data analytics in order to ensure the sharing of truthful data with supply chain members. Furthermore, the implementation of IoT and the use of big data analytics allow for monitoring and preventive maintenance of machines and robots, as well as ongoing communication throughout the supply chain (Roy and Roy, 2019). Although there are plenty of avenues available for exploring the integration of big data with other digital technologies for SSCM, only a few studies have so far tried to do so. Therefore, the second gap is:</p>
        <p>Gap 2. : To explore the interfaces of big data with other emerging industry 4.0-related technologies for promoting sustainable supply chain management.</p>
        <p>From our in-depth analysis of the studies, a number of lessons and other avenues for future research emerged. The first lesson is that developing big data analytics capability has become mandatory for building competitive sustainable supply chains (Mani et al., 2017;Tseng et al., 2019). Indeed, this is the suggested pathway for firms seeking to achieve sustainable supply chain outcomes (Bag et al., 2020). BDPA can be used to discover SSCM-related insights through higher quality and completion of data (Belaud et al., 2019), which contribute to better and faster decision-making (Zhang et al., 2020). Astill et al. (2019) state that BDPA adds value for SSCM by highlighting inferences from the data that humans may fail to note. Currently, many companies collect massive amounts of data across different business processes, but struggle to analyse this volume of data and find its true value (Singh and El-Kassar, 2019). The use of BDPA has enabled organizations to manage voluminous data in an effective and refined manner, which supports sustainable outcomes across the supply chain (Bag et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>In order to foster successful big data initiatives among supply chain partners and achieve sustainable outcomes, there is a need to build a truly data-driven culture and to invest in relationship management capability (Dubey et al., 2018). However, how best to build such a data-driven culturenot only within firms, but also among SC membersremains unclear. Thus, the third avenue for future research is: Gap 3. : To examine how to build a data-driven culture in order to foster successful big data collaborative initiatives among sustainable supply chain partners.</p>
        <p>The second lesson relates to the benefits that big data analytics can offer for implementing sustainable practices in the supply chain. BDPA capability enables the promotion of economic, environmental and social performance in supply chains (Dubey et al., 2019;Jeble et al., 2018;Tseng et al., 2019). In this sense, managers, who face a constant tradeoff between the triple-bottom-line factors should acknowledge that big data can provide significant benefits in all three dimensions (Dubey et al., 2019). In addition, it offers numerous operational advantages for firms (Tseng et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Concerning the economic dimension, the potential benefits of using big data in analysing operations management and supply chain activities include a 15-20% increase in Return on Investment (ROI) and productivity, reduction of costs, and creation of new competitive advantages and strategies for growing revenue (Ahmed et al., 2018;Roy and Roy, 2019;Visconti and Morea, 2019). Ahmed et al. (2018) explain that big data can predict the financial impact of supply chainrelated decisions before they are implemented, hence avoiding losses. In addition, big data can assist in maintaining optimal inventory levels and mitigate the bullwhip effect, both of which are crucial for the company's financial success (Samir et al., 2019). Finally, Tseng et al. (2019) suggest that a data-driven sustainable supply chain may deliver economic benefits such as cost saving, enhanced coordination and collaboration among supply chain tiers, and faster response to market demands.</p>
        <p>In terms of environmental impacts, big data can support preliminary decision-making on resource utilization, processes and technologies, upstream and downstream chains (Belaud et al., 2019). It can be used to monitor environmental indicators such as CO2 emissions and air pollutants, helping promote better understanding of environmental impacts on SSCM and providing more accurate environmental impact assessments (Badiezadeh et al., 2018;Jiao et al., 2018). In this sense, BDPA offers informed decision making regarding various environmental sustainability issues in the supply chain, and it can help to mitigate uncertainty and greenhouse gas emissions burdens (Jiao et al., 2018). Such decision-making support is particularly important when trying to maximise resource utilization (Gupta et al., 2019). In addition, Mani et al. (2017) mention that BDPA's environmental benefits for supply chains can arise together with economic gains, presenting a win-win situation, such in the case of big data helping with timely sales forecasts, which decrease stock and waste, and at the same time, save energy and resources. The relationship between BDPA and environmental concerns can be particularly relevant to emerging markets such as Brazil, India, China, Russia, and South Africa (BRICS) (Song et al., 2020;Song et al., 2019a;Song and Wang, 2019). In this context, big data is also capable of offering insightful information for promoting emerging business concepts, such as the circular economy (Gupta et al., 2019) and closed-loop supply chain (Jiao et al., 2018), which leads to the fourth gap: Gap 4. : To understand how big data analytics can drive closed-loop actions in sustainable supply chains.</p>
        <p>Big data has a significant potential application for social sustainability in supply chains (Badiezadeh et al., 2018). It encourages ethical behaviours among supply chain tiers by allowing higher traceability and transparency, which may increase commitment to sustainable practices and also the reputation of industries (Kamble et al., 2020;Roy and Roy, 2019;Shukla and Tiwari, 2017). In the same vein, Raut et al. (2019) argue that BDA promotes information sharing with suppliers and ensures their involvement in implementing sustainable practices. Additionally, Venkatesh et al. (2020) show that BD assists in monitoring and tracking social sustainability in multi-tier globally sourced supply chains; for instance, in assessing the compliance history of suppliers. Considering that social concerns in managing supply chains include child labour, unethical behaviour, equality and discrimination, forced labour and slavery, among other issues, it is significant that companies can predict various such social problems through the information management practices facilitated by big data analytics (Mani et al., 2017). Specifically, for agri-food supply chains, big data and industry 4.0-related technologies are capable of shortening the SC, offering social benefits to deprived communities (Kamble et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Finally, regarding operational gains, BDPA offers numerous opportunities. First, it allows information sharing and efficient decision-making among supply chain members (Dubey et al., 2019;Kamble et al., 2020;Raut et al., 2019). Consequently, BPA can help to ensure suppliers' cooperation in implementing sustainable practices (Raut et al., 2019) while, at the same time, being used to effectively predict and mitigate supply chain risks and uncertainties (Mani et al., 2017;Wu et al., 2017). In addition, BDPA has a role in supply chains' strategic and operational planning phases (Wang et al., 2016). In terms of strategic planning, big data technology can assist in decisions regarding sourcing, supply chain network design, product design and development (Wang et al., 2016). In operational planning, it can be applied to enhance demand forecasting, procurement, production, inventory and logistics (Visconti and Morea, 2019;Wang et al., 2016), increasing the optimization of procedures within supply chain organizations (Astill et al., 2019). Moreover, firms can analyse customer preferences and buying behaviour to negotiate with suppliers (Ahmed et al., 2018). Overall, BDPA acts as a facilitator in resolving the operational complexities of SSCM (Jeble et al., 2018;Gupta et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>In this context, big data is claimed to be essential for decision making in highly volatile and competitive markets (Kaur and Singh, 2018) since it improves supply chain planning and demand forecasting (Wang et al., 2016), identifies consumption patterns and supply chain bottlenecks (Samir et al., 2019), as well as reducing risks and uncertainties (Wu et al., 2017). Therefore, big data offers an opportunity to make sustainable supply chains more resilient to external shocks (Kaur and Singh, 2018;Papadopoulos et al., 2017;Visconti and Morea, 2019). Yet, empirical studies which effectively address big data support to make supply chains resilient and sustainable are lacking (Fosso-Wamba et al., 2015;Visconti and Morea, 2019). Thus, the fifth recommendation is:</p>
        <p>Gap 5. : To conduct more empirical research to explore BDPA's support in promoting resilience in sustainable supply chains.</p>
        <p>The third lesson comprises the challenges on big data-driven SSCM. Managers and practitioners need to acknowledge that despite the benefits of BDPA for the sustainability of supply chains, its implementation also presents challenges for the organizations. Adopting BDPA in supply chains requires considerable effort from all stakeholders involved and presents barriers ranging from technical issues, such as Internet connection and storage requirements, to those concerning device security, privacy and confidentiality of sensitive business data, as well as government requirements and regulations and consumer acceptance (Astill et al., 2019;Jagtap and Duong, 2019). Nonetheless, few studies have addressed the drawbacks and barriers of using BDPA to assist in sustainable supply chains; we therefore suggest: Gap 6. : To explore the challenges and barriers faced by companies implementing big data analytics to improve sustainable supply chain management.</p>
        <p>In this same vein, our fourth and last lesson regards the complementary capabilities needed to overcome barriers and to fully reap the benefits of BDPA for SSCM. It is necessary to be aware that big data-driven sustainable supply chain management can be facilitated by developing other organizational capabilities. For example, Singh and El-Kassar (2019) suggest that while technological challenges in assimilating big data become greater when firms decide to embrace internal and external sustainable practices in supply chains, such challenges could be handled by developing corporate commitment and green human resource management (Green HRM) capability. Similarly, Mandal (2018) indicates that managers need to concentrate on effective planning and propose appropriate training for employees and partners in order to leverage big data analytics to support strategic and operational supply chain activities. In addition, investing in a skilled workforce and promoting knowledge sharing capabilities are both important for big data implementation (Dubey et al., 2019). Therefore, we propose: Gap 7. : To investigate the role of different organizational capabilities such as Green HRM in handling challenges and promoting big data technology for sustainable practices in supply chains.</p>
        <p>Considering the current calls for research on sustainability, environmental management and big data technology (Song et al., 2019b), we believe this work provides useful guidance for practitioners and academics by presenting implications and lessons to leverage digitallyenabled sustainable supply chains as well as gaps for future research. Fig. 6 summarises the managerial contributions.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this study was to extend the understanding of digitally-enabled sustainable supply chains by systematising published studies addressing the implications of big data. Through a systematic review of selected articles, this work makes three significant contributions. First, it provides an overview of the extant literature on this topic in recent years. The second contribution is the proposition of seven literature gaps to foster future investigations on big data-driven sustainable supply chains. Third, this study offers four lessons for firms' managers aiming to use big data for sustainable practices in supply chains. Accordingly, the findings of this study have implications for scholars and practitioners.</p>
        <p>For academics, this work proposes seven recommendations for future investigations throughout the results and discussion section.</p>
        <p>These research gaps represent opportunities for scholars to advance the body of knowledge on big data applications for SSCM. In particular, new studies based on big data, which use modelling methods aimed at the optimization of sustainable supply chains, constitute an important contribution to this field.</p>
        <p>This research gap (Gap 1) has the greatest potential to generate results directly related to managerial implications for supply chain management. With the integration of new digital technologies from industry 4.0 to BDPA (Gap 2), the predictive capacity of the modelling method is increased. Studies generated on this basis may result in a set of management practices that guarantee:</p>
        <p>• Sharing of accurate data between supply chain members, assisting decision-making (Zhang et al., 2020); • Monitoring of operational processes throughout the chain (Roy and Roy, 2019;Tseng et al., 2019), generating benefits directly related to productivity, resource optimization and ROI; • Significant improvement in the management of relationships between members (Dubey et al., 2018), including the development of a culture of data integration and sharing; • Better management of sustainable practices in the supply chain, monitoring environmental (understanding and dynamics of the impacts generated) and social (appropriate, ethical and transparent attitudes of members, as well as impacts on the community) indicators, reducing risks in both dimensions.</p>
        <p>In addition, for business managers, we have provided four general managerial implications: developing big data analytics capability has to become a business priority in order to effectively build competitive sustainable supply chains; big data has benefits for each of the triplebottom-line dimensions in the supply chain; the implementation of BDPA for the sustainability of supply chains presents significant challenges for firms; and the development of other organizational capabilities is needed to overcome challenges and deploy the benefits of big data technology for SSCM.</p>
        <p>Regarding methodological limitations, it should be noted that this study selected only articles containing specific keywords in the title, abstract and keyword fields. Thus, there may exist publications addressing the research topic which were left out of our sample. It is also limited to analysing the content of publications found in the Scopus database. Although Scopus is a highly recognised academic database, it may not gather every relevant document on the subject. Another limitation is related to the scope of the research, which deals directly with big data implications for sustainable supply chain management. Although other industry 4.0 integration technologies have been mentioned in BD studies, our analysis does not directly relate to the impact or challenges of any of these technologies on the development of sustainable supply chains. This postpones the discussion of other industry 4.0 technologies' role in the development of BDPA in SSCM, which may be addressed in future research.</p>
        <p>In terms of recommendations for future research, it is suggested that the seven research gaps highlighted in this study are addressed in specific studies in order to deepen the perspective on the dimensions of each gap. Future studies using the modelling method stand out as a promising avenue, as this method can present better practical contributions for business managers interested in sustainable supply chain development. In addition, empirical studies associated with the efforts of management to use BDPA in global supply chains is recommended, as the need for resilience is an important requirement for sustainable performance. Conversely, it is also suggested that specific studies investigate disadvantages and barriers (external, integration and intraorganizational) to BDPA adoption in the development of sustainable supply chains. There are ample opportunities for future research on this topic, as different technological approaches and economic, social and environmental management can be related to SSCM. ( 2018)</p>
