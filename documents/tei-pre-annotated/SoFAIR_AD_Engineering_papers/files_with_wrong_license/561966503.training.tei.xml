        <p>Measurements of autoignition delay times of NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 mixtures in a rapid compression machine are reported at pressures from 20-75 bar and temperatures in the range 1040-1210 K. The equivalence ratio, using O 2 /N 2 /Ar mixtures as oxidizer, varied for pure NH 3 from 0.5 to 3.0; NH 3 /H 2 mixtures with H 2 fraction between 0 and 10% were examined at equivalence ratios 0.5 and 1.0. In contrast to many hydrocarbon fuels, the results indicate that, for the conditions studied, autoignition of NH 3 becomes slower with increasing equivalence ratio. Hydrogen is seen to have a strong ignition-enhancing effect on NH 3 . The experimental data, which show similar trends to those observed previously by He et al. ( 2019) [28] , were used to evaluate four NH 3 oxidation mechanisms: a new version of the mechanism described by Glarborg et al. (2018) [29] , with an updated rate constant for the formation of hydrazine, NH 2 + NH 2 ( + M) = N 2 H 4 ( + M), and the literature mechanisms from Klippenstein et al. (2011) [30] , Mathieu and Petersen (2015) [25] , and Shrestha et al. ( 2018) [31] . In general, the mechanism from this study has the best performance, yielding satisfactory prediction of ignition delay times both of pure NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 mixtures at high pressures (40-60 bar). Kinetic analysis based on present mechanism indicates that the ignition enhancing effect of H 2 on NH 3 is closely related to the formation and decomposition of H 2 O 2 ; even modest hydrogen addition changes the identity of the major reactions from those involving NH x radicals to those that dominate the H 2 /O 2 mechanism. Flux analysis shows that the oxidation path of NH 3 is not influenced by H 2 addition. We also indicate the methodological importance of using a non-reactive mixture having the same heat capacity as the reactive mixture for determining the non-reactive volume trace for simulation purposes, as well as that of limiting the variation in temperature after compression, by limiting the uncertainty in the experimentally determined quantities that characterize the state of the mixture.Measurements of autoignition delay times of NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 mixtures in a rapid compression machine are reported at pressures from 20-75 bar and temperatures in the range 1040-1210 K.

        <p>The incentive to reduce the carbon footprint of combustion engines is driving the development and introduction of non-fossil fuels. Ammonia (NH 3 ) is considered a promising alternative fuel: it is carbon free, can be produced from renewable hydrogen (H 2 ) and nitrogen from the air (N 2 ) [1 , 2] and in liquid form has a relatively high energy density. However, ammonia has different combustion properties compared to common engine fuels, challenging the use of ammonia in engines [3][4][5] . The significantly lower burning velocity as compared to hydrocarbon fuels (see below) complicates the use of ammonia in the current generation of high-performance reciprocating engines and gas turbines. Also, a significant fraction of the NO x emissions from ammonia combustion derives from the bound nitrogen in the fuel, diminishing the efficacy of NO x control strategies based on temperature reduction to mitigate the Zeldovich mechanism. In this regard, very recently Okafor et al. [6] and Karuta et al. [7] showed that rich/lean staged combustion could result in low NO x emissions from an ammoniafueled micro gas turbine.The incentive to reduce the carbon footprint of combustion engines is driving the development and introduction of non-fossil fuels.

        <p>A number of studies have assessed the rate of NH 3 combustion. Burning velocities of NH 3 were determined by Takizawa et al. [8] at atmospheric pressure and by Hayakawa et al. at elevated pressure [9] . The burning velocity of NH 3 is roughly five times lower than that of methane (CH 4 ). Flow-reactor studies of ammonia oxidation have been performed by Song et al. [10] at high pressures and by Nakamura et al. [11 , 12] at low pressure in a microflow reactor. A method to enhance the burning velocity is by admixing NH 3 with other fuel molecules that could be considered in this context as "additives", such as H 2 or CH 4 . Structures and burning velocities of NH 3 and NH 3 /additive-fueled flames, particularly regarding H 2 addition, were reported in [13][14][15][16][17] .A number of studies have assessed the rate of NH 3 combustion.

        <p>However, when considering the use of additives to enhance the burning rate in an engine, one must also be cognizant of the impact of the additive on the autoignition characteristics of the combined fuel. While strongly enhanced autoignition is favorable for use in compression-ignition engines, the negative impact on engine knock can severely limit the utility of the fuel mixture in spark-ignited or dual-fuel (gas) engines.However, when considering the use of additives to enhance the burning rate in an engine, one must also be cognizant of the impact of the additive on the autoignition characteristics of the combined fuel.

        <p>Ammonia autoignition has been studied in shock tubes [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] and Rapid Compression Machines (RCM) [27 , 28] . The recent studies have reported measurements of the autoignition delay time of NH 3 at elevated pressures more relevant for engine conditions [25][26][27][28] . Mathieu and Petersen [25] studied the ignition delay times of NH 3 in a shock tube at pressures up to 30 bar, temperatures of 1560-2455 K, an equivalence ratio ( Ï•) of 0.5, and highly diluted in argon. Shu et al. [26] reported the ignition delay times of NH 3 in shock tube over a temperature range of 1100-1600 K, pressures of 20 and 40 bar, and values of Ï• = 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. Pochet et al. [27] measured the ignition delay times of NH 3 /H 2 mixtures (0, 10 and 25% vol. H 2 ) at fuel lean conditions ( Ï• = 0.2, 0.35, 0.5), high pressures (43 and 65 bar) and intermediate temperatures (10 0 0-110 0 K) in an RCM. Very recently, He et al. [28] reported the ignition delay times of NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 mixtures (1-20% vol. H 2 ) measured in an RCM at pressures from 20 to 60 bar, temperatures from 950 to 1150 K, and equivalence ratios from 0.5 to 2. There it was reported that the mechanism from Glarborg et al. [29] showed reasonable agreement for pure NH 3 but underpredicted the ignition delay times for NH 3 /H 2 mixtures by up to a factor of 3. In contrast, the mechanism of Klippenstein et al. [30] showed reasonable agreement for NH 3 /H 2 mixtures but substantially overpredicted the autoignition delay time of pure NH 3 , by more than a factor of 4. We note that the faithful prediction of autoignition delay times for the possible fuel mixtures of ammonia is essential for a reliable assessment of the utility of the fuel in engines.Ammonia autoignition has been studied in shock tubes [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] and Rapid Compression Machines (RCM) [27 , 28] .

        <p>To gain more insight in the autoignition behavior of NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 mixtures at conditions relevant to practical engines, as well as to provide additional benchmark data for mechanism verification, we report measurements of the ignition delay times of NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 mixtures in an RCM at equivalence ratios varying from 0.5 to 3.0, pressures from 20 to 75 bar, and temperatures in the range 1040-1210 K. We note that the measurements of pure ammonia at pressures above 40 bar and at Ï• = 2.0 and 3.0 reported here are a significant extension of the test of the chemical mechanism in comparison with previous reports. The hydrogen fraction was varied in the range 0-10%. We compare the measurements with calculations using a modified version of the mechanism of Glarborg et al. [29] , as well as with the mechanisms of Klippenstein et al. [30] , Mathieu and Petersen [25] , and Shrestha et al. [31] . A kinetic analysis was performed to examine NH 3 oxidation under these conditions and the influence of H 2 addition on the ignition process.To gain more insight in the autoignition behavior of NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 mixtures at conditions relevant to practical engines, as well as to provide additional benchmark data for mechanism verification, we report measurements of the ignition delay times of NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 mixtures in an RCM at equivalence ratios varying from 0.5 to 3.0, pressures from 20 to 75 bar, and temperatures in the range 1040-1210 K.

        <p>The ignition delay time measurements were performed in an RCM whose details are described in [32 , 33] , and only a brief description will be given here. The gas mixtures were compressed in ~10-20 ms to the peak pressure, with 80% of the compression occurring in less than 3 ms. A creviced piston head was used in this machine to obtain a homogenous reacting core during the experiment [34] . The pressure trace was measured by a Kistler ThermoComp quartz pressure sensor with thermal-shockoptimized construction.

The compositions (in mole fraction) of the mixtures examined in this study are shown in Table 1 . All gas mixtures were prepared in advance in a 10-L gas bottle, used to charge the combustion chamber to the required initial pressure. The mixtures were allowed to mix for least 24 h to ensure homogeneity. The ignition delay time was defined as the interval between the end of compression and the maximum in the rate of pressure increase during ignition, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The day-to-day reproducibility of the measurements, including repositioning of the piston height, was determined to be better than 5%. The uncertainty of the calculated core gas temperature ( T c ) is less than Â± 3.5 K for all measurements [35] .

Both Glarborg et al. [29] and Klippenstein et al. [30] relied on the theoretical work of Klippenstein et al. [36] , which was in good agreement with the low-temperature measurements of the reaction [37][38][39][40][41] . At elevated temperature, the reaction has been studied over a wide range of pressure in shock tubes. Diesen [42] and Meyer et al. [43] report data, presumably at the low-pressure limit. Kinetic modeling of the experiments of Diesen [42] indicates that k 1b,0 is roughly 1/3 of the observed disappearance rate for N 2 H 4 , since both the amino radicals formed in the dissociation act to remove hydrazine. The rate constant reported by Diesen [42] has thus been reduced by a factor of three. Similarly, the rate constants reported by Meyer et al. [43] were multiplied by a factor of 2/3.

        <p>The reason for the discrepancy between the theoretical rate coefficients for NH 2 + NH 2 ( + M) = N 2 H 4 ( + M) and the shock tube measurements of the reverse step is not known at present. The heat of formation of N 2 H 4 has been in question, but the current value [29] is in excellent agreement with the recent recommendations by Dorofeeva et al. [45] and Feller et al. [46] . It is an issue whether the experimental data are truly obtained at the lowand high-pressure limits, respectively, but more work is required to resolve this issue. Under the conditions of the present work, the modification of the rate constant for R1 turns out to have only a limited impact on ignition delay predictions, calculations with the mechanism of Glarborg et al. [29] are largely within 10% of those using the modified mechanism; consequently, only the latter are shown.The reason for the discrepancy between the theoretical rate coefficients for NH 2 + NH 2 ( + M) = N 2 H 4 ( + M) and the shock tube measurements of the reverse step is not known at present.

        <p>The ignition delay times for the conditions in the RCM were simulated using the homogenous reactor code from the Cantera package [47] . To account for changes in the mixture conditions during compression and post-compression heat loss, the specific volume of the adiabatic core was used as input into the simulations. The specific volume was derived from the measured pressure trace of a non-reactive gas mixture that had the same average heat capacity as the combustible mixture. An illustration of the measured and simulated pressure profiles at T c = 1100 K, P c = 55 bar is shown in Fig. 1 . As will be discussed below, using a mixture having the average heat capacity for the measured non-reactive trace, as opposed to the common practice of replacing the oxygen in the mixture by nitrogen, can impact the reliability of the simulations.The ignition delay times for the conditions in the RCM were simulated using the homogenous reactor code from the Cantera package [47] .

        <p>The ignition delay times of pure NH 3 measured at Ï• = 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 and 2.0 are shown in Fig. 4 . As can be seen, the ignition delay times decrease with increasing temperature and pressure at all equivalence ratios. The data for isobars and isotherms indicate a significant increase in ignition delay time with equivalence ratio, by a factor of two when going from 0.5 to 1 and from 1 to 2. We note that the substantial differences in measured ignition delay times for equivalence ratios 0.5 and 1.0 reported here were not observed in [28] . However, the interpretation of this functional dependence for practical devices is complicated by the change in (Ar + N 2 )/O 2 ratio that was necessary to reach the ignition temperatures under these condition of pressure, as is often done in ignition studies (see, for example, [25 , 28 , 49] ).

        <p>Given the agreement between the experiments and the simulations using the current mechanism, we can disentangle the effects of varying inert/O2 ratio from those of the change in equivalence ratio mentioned above. In Fig. 7 , we show the equivalent data for Fig. 4 a, but using a constant Ar/O 2 ratio of 5. These results show that, while the effect of inert/O 2 ratio seen in Fig. 4 is substantial, the ignition delay time for ammonia increases with equivalence ratio, in contrast with the ignition of many hydrocarbons (see, for example, [32 , 50] ).

As reported by others [28] , Fig. 8 shows a significant ignition-enhancing effect of H 2 . At Ï• = 0.5, the ignition delay times of both isobars ( Fig. 8 a) and isotherms ( Fig. 8 b) are reduced by a factor of ~12 when H 2 addition increases from 0 to 5% of the fuel mixture, and by an additional factor of ~2 when increasing the H 2 fraction from 5% to 10%. At Ï• = 1.0, 5% H 2 addition to NH 3 leads to a reduction of the ignition delay times by a factor of ~28, indicating that the ignitionenhancing effect of H 2 addition is more pronounced at higher Ï•. A similar trend is found at Ï• = 1.0 ( Fig. 9 c), again with a factor of ~2.5 between P c = 40 and 60 bar, but with a larger factor, of ~6, between P c = 20 and 40 bar.Experiments with three NH 3 /H 2 mixtures (5% and 10% H 2 addition at Ï• = 0.5 and 5% H 2 addition at Ï• = 1.0) were conducted to characterize the impact of H 2 on the ignition delay and to further evaluate the performance of the mechanisms.

        <p>The agreement of the calculations using the present mechanism with the measurements for the isobars at P c = 40 bar and 60 bar is generally within 30%. At P c = 20 bar, an underprediction by a factor ~2 is observed for both hydrogen fractions at Ï• = 0.5 ( Fig. 9 a and b) and by a factor of 4.5 for 5% H 2 at Ï• = 1.0.

        <p>As mentioned in the introduction, very recently He et al. [28] also reported ignition delay time measurements for NH 3 /H 2 mixtures. They found that the mechanism from Glarborg et al. [29] underpredicts the ignition delay times for NH 3 /H 2 mixtures compared to their measurements. For instance, an underprediction by a factor of ~3 was observed at Ï• = 0.5, P c = 40 bar with 5% H 2 addition ( Fig. 5 c in [28] ). The ignition delay times measured for the same conditions in this study are consistent with those measured by He et al. [28] . However, as shown in Fig. 10 , calculated ignition delay times using the current mechanism (with marginal differences in computed delay times compared with those obtained using Glarborg et al. [29] ) agree to better than 30% with the ignition delay times measured under the same conditions.As mentioned in the introduction, very recently He et al.

        <p>Since the ignition delay times were simulated using pressure traces derived from non-reactive mixtures, we noticed a difference in the way in which the non-reactive experiments were performed between [28] and the method used here, which may contribute to the observed differences. In [28] , as well as in [4 8 , 4 9 , 51] , the non-reactive experiments were conducted by replacing the O 2 in the combustible mixtures with the same fraction of N 2 . Because N 2 has slightly smaller heat capacity than O 2 , this leads to larger ratios of the heat capacities and thus T c in the non-reactive experiments in the reactive For example, a set of measured pressure traces and the derived volume traces for 'mixture 5b' in [28] were provided to us by the authors of [28] , shown in Fig. 11 . The non-reactive pressure and volume traces show differences with the reactive traces. The equivalent non-reactive temperature history for this example give T c roughly 15 K higher than that derived from the measured profile. In the present study, rather than replacing the oxygen by nitrogen to yield the unreactive mixture, the difference in the heat capacities between O 2 and N 2 were considered: the N 2 fraction was adjusted (to be slightly larger than that of the O 2 being replaced, with a corresponding reduction in the Ar fraction) to give the same average ratio of the heat capacities as in the reactive mixture. This results in a faithful duplication of the peak pressure and pressure decrease after compression but prior to ignition as shown in Fig. 12 . The differences in computed temperature after compression (T c ) were less than 1 K in this case. When using the reactive mixture heat capacity in the non-reactive volume trace from [28] , the pressure trace still shows the same discrepancy with the measured reactive trace, but the error in the maximum temperature is reduced to roughly 4 K. (We note that the 4 K inconsistency when simply replacing oxygen by the same fraction of nitrogen is specific for this example; under other conditions, the inconsistency could be significantly different. We are currently quantifying this aspect further and will report it in a methodological assessment.) Although significant, the 4 K for this example is still not enough to account for the differences in simulated results observed in the present comparison. A direct comparison of the reactive pressure traces in Figs. 11 and12 (visible in the insets in these figures) shows that the pressure (and coupled to it the temperature) after compression in the profile from [28] is nearly constant until ignition, while the pressure profile measured here decreases significantly after compression. Since T c in both mixtures is reported to be the same, it is not physically reasonable for these two profiles to give the same ignition delay time.Since the ignition delay times were simulated using pressure traces derived from non-reactive mixtures, we noticed a difference in the way in which the non-reactive experiments were performed between [28] and the method used here, which may contribute to the observed differences.

        <p>We note that the supplementary material in [28] discusses the uncertainties in the experimental conditions, particularly initial temperature and pressure after compression, that result in a net uncertainty in T c of 10-20 K. In Fig. 10 this uncertainty in the measurement conditions is reflected, using error bars of Â±20 K as an example. As shown in [28] , this results in an uncertainty in the computed ignition delay time of roughly a factor of three; Fig. 10 shows that a difference of 20 K in T c is enough to bring the measured and simulated ignition delay times reported in [28] to within ~50%. In the current report, the measured quantities are ascertained to yield the resultant Â± 3.5 K [35] uncertainty in T c noted above and indicated by the error bars in Fig. 10 . This uncertainty in T c translates into an uncertainty in the computed ignition delay times of 5-10%. The differences in the pressure profiles for similar reported experimental conditions and uncertainty in the temperature after compression argue for caution when regarding the apparent excellent agreement between the experimental results suggested by the points neglecting the error bars seen in Fig. 10 .

        <p>Based on these observations, we emphasize the importance of matching the heat capacity of the reactive mixture when determining the volume profile from the non-reactive mixture, indicating the uncertainty in T c and reducing the uncertainty in the quantities that determine T c when quantitatively assessing the agreement between experimental and simulated ignition delay times for the purposes of mechanism evaluation.Based on these observations, we emphasize the importance of matching the heat capacity of the reactive mixture when determining the volume profile from the non-reactive mixture, indicating the uncertainty in T c and reducing the uncertainty in the quantities that determine T c when quantitatively assessing the agreement between experimental and simulated ignition delay times for the purposes of mechanism evaluation.</p>

        <p>With H 2 addition, key reactions involved in the H 2 /O 2 mechanism become important, including the competition between H + O 2 = O + OH and H + O 2 ( + M) = HO 2 ( + M), for which the ignition of pure ammonia exhibits virtually no sensitivity. The dissociation of H 2 O 2 , H 2 O 2 ( + M) = 2OH ( + M), becomes the second most important ignition-enhancing reaction at a relatively modest 10% H 2 in the fuel. We also observe the increased sensitivity of ignition to HO 2 + NH 3 = H 2 O 2 + NH 2 upon hydrogen addition as compared to pure ammonia. Note that while hydrazine formation is an important step in ammonia oxidation, Fig. 13 indicates a sensitivity of at most ~10%, consistent with the observation that the changes in the rate constant for this reaction presented in Section 2.2 has only a modest effect on the ignition delay time as compared with the mechanism in [29] .With H 2 addition, key reactions involved in the H 2 /O 2 mechanism become important, including the competition between H + O 2 = O + OH and H + O 2 ( + M) = HO 2 ( + M), for which the ignition of pure ammonia exhibits virtually no sensitivity. The dissociation of H 2 O 2 , H 2 O 2 ( + M) = 2OH ( + M), becomes the second most important ignition-enhancing reaction at a relatively modest 10% H 2 in the fuel.

        <p>Fig. 14 shows the most sensitive reactions for pure NH 3 and NH 3 with 5 and 10% H 2 addition at Ï• = 1.0, T c = 1080 K, P c = 60 bar. The most sensitive reactions for pure NH 3 at Ï• = 1.0 are identical to those for pure NH 3 at Ï• = 0. sensitivities observed for the conditions here (60 bar) are qualitatively similar to those reported in [28] (up to a maximum pressure of 40 bar), there are some differences in the relative ranking. Since the sensitivity analyses in [28] appear to be normalized (while here they are not), and with no details as to how the analyses were performed, we refrain from a detailed comparison with the analysis presented there. We do note that in [28] the mechanism from [29] shows H + NH 3 = H 2 + NH 2 as ignition inhibiting at 20% H 2 in the mixture, in contrast to the ignition-enhancing behavior observed here at lower H 2 fractions. The reaction path of pure NH 3 , calculated using the current mechanism, is shown in Fig. 15 . Fluxes lower than 5% are not shown to avoid clutter. As can be seen, ammonia is primarily consumed by O, H and OH radicals, producing the amine radical NH 2 . The NH 2 radical is partly converted into NO in the sequenceFig. 14 shows the most sensitive reactions for pure NH 3 and NH 3 with 5 and 10% H 2 addition at Ï• = 1.0, T c = 1080 K, P c = 60 bar.

        <p>The NH 2 radical can also recombine to form hydrazine (N 2 H 4 ), followed by sequential H abstraction to form N 2 . (The reaction path of NH 3 with 10% H 2 , included in the Supplementary Material, shows that 10% H 2 addition had no significant influence on the NH 3 oxidation paths). While the major paths observed here are similar to those reported in [28] , using the mechanism in [29] , we note that the route via hydrazine has been left out of the analysis in [28] . However, the path to hydrazine formation changes the routing of NH 2 by only 10% under the conditions described here.The NH 2 radical can also recombine to form hydrazine (N 2 H 4 ), followed by sequential H abstraction to form N 2 .

        <p>To obtain a better understanding of the effect of H 2 addition on ignition, the species histories for H 2 O 2 , HO 2 , OH and H in the period leading to ignition for pure NH 3 and for 10% H 2 addition were calculated using the current mechanism, shown in Fig. 16 . For this purpose, the calculations are performed as constant volume simulations. As can be seen, with 10% H 2 addition, hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2 and HO 2 accumulate before ignition to a fraction that is ~10 times higher than when igniting pure NH 3 . This results in a faster buildup of the radical pool, particularly for OH. Similar species histories were found at Ï• = 1.0 (included in the Supplementary Material). Clearly, with only modest hydrogen addition the fractions of species that are important for the ignition in fuels dominated by the H 2 /O 2 mechanism are drastically increased.To obtain a better understanding of the effect of H 2 addition on ignition, the species histories for H 2 O 2 , HO 2 , OH and H in the period leading to ignition for pure NH 3 and for 10% H 2 addition were calculated using the current mechanism, shown in Fig. 16 .

        <p>The autoignition behavior of NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 was studied in a RCM at Ï• ranging from 0.5 to 3.0, pressures from 20 to 75 bar, temperatures from 1040 to 1210 K, and with H 2 addition in the range 0-10%. In contrast to many hydrocarbon fuels [32 , 50] , the ignition delay time of pure NH 3 increases with equivalence ratio. Hydrogen addition has a significant ignition-enhancing effect on NH 3 , with 5% H 2 addition reducing the ignition delay times by a factor of ~28 at Ï• = 1.0. Comparison of the present experimental data with a mechanism described here and mechanisms from Klippenstein et al. [30] , Mathieu and Petersen [25] and Shrestha et al. [31] are used to evaluate their veracity in predicting ignition delay times under the conditions reported here. The mechanism from this study has the best performance, yielding predictions for both pure NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 mixture at high pressures (40-60 bar) that are generally within 40% of the experimental results.The autoignition behavior of NH 3 and NH 3 /H 2 was studied in a RCM at Ï• ranging from 0.5 to 3.0, pressures from 20 to 75 bar, temperatures from 1040 to 1210 K, and with H 2 addition in the range 0-10%.

        <p>Sensitivity analysis of ignition delay times using the present mechanism indicates the importance of O 2 in the oxidation of H 2 NO and NH 2 ; increasing O 2 by decreasing the equivalence ratio suggests the trend of shortening of the ignition delay times observed in the measurements. The addition of modest hydrogen fractions decreases the importance of these reactions in favor of the reactions from the H 2 /O 2 mechanism, particularly H + O 2 = OH + O and H 2 O 2 ( + M) = 2OH ( + M). Given the limited computed sensitivity of the recombination of NH 2 to hydrazine, the change in rate constant reported here results in modest changes in the simulated ignition delay times as compared with the mechanism used in [29] . Calculated species histories show an increase in the preignition fractions of hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2 and HO 2 by a factor of 10 with 10% H 2 in the fuel as compared with pure NH 3 , consistent with the strong ignition-enhancing effect of hydrogen at low fractions.Sensitivity analysis of ignition delay times using the present mechanism indicates the importance of O 2 in the oxidation of H 2 NO and NH 2 ; increasing O 2 by decreasing the equivalence ratio suggests the trend of shortening of the ignition delay times observed in the measurements.

        <p>We further indicate the importance of matching the heat capacities of the non-reactive mixtures to those of the reactive mixtures for determining the volume profile for simulation purposes and of limiting the variation in T c by limiting the uncertainty in the experimentally determined quantities that characterize the state of the mixture.We further indicate the importance of matching the heat capacities of the non-reactive mixtures to those of the reactive mixtures for determining the volume profile for simulation purposes and of limiting the variation in T c by limiting the uncertainty in the experimentally determined quantities that characterize the state of the mixture.</p>
