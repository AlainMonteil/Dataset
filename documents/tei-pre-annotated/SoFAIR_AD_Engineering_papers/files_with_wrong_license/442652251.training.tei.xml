        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) will transform business practices and industries and has the potential to address major societal problems, including sustainability. Degradation of the natural environment and the climate crisis are exceedingly complex phenomena requiring the most advanced and innovative solutions. Aiming to spur groundbreaking research and practical solutions of AI for environmental sustainability, we argue that artificial intelligence (AI) can support the derivation of culturally appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to reduce the natural resource and energy intensity of human activities. The true value of AI will not be in how it enables society to reduce its energy, water, and land use intensities, but rather, at a higher level, how it facilitates and fosters environmental governance. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that research regarding AI for sustainability is challenged by (1) overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, (2) uncertain human behavioral responses to AI-based interventions, (3) increased cybersecurity risks, (4) adverse impacts of AI applications, and (5) difficulties in measuring effects of intervention strategies. The review indicates that future studies of AI for sustainability should use (1) multilevel views, (2) systems dynamics approaches, (3) design thinking, (4) psychological and sociological considerations, and (5) economic value considerations to show how AI can deliver immediate solutions without introducing long-term threats to environmental sustainability.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the world has entered a critical state of climate crisis (Leahy, 2019). Our days of discussing global warming and climate change are over (The Carrington, 2019). More than three decades after the notable Brundtland Commission Report, the world continues to struggle with the need to transform human activities to ensure long-term existential survival, although the challenges are exceedingly complex and require all our technological expertise to develop psychological, sociological, and organizational factors that currently impede human progress in this area.</p>
        <p>To spur groundbreaking research and suggest practical applications of AI to address environmental sustainability, we develop a multi-faceted research roadmap focused on how AI can contribute to better environmental governance and the development of technological solutions relevant for long-term sustainability. The roadmap is grounded in a comprehensive review of the literature and our assessment of AI limitations for addressing challenges related to environmental sustainability. Rather than focus on the technical aspects of AI that have already captured significant research and practitioner interest, we focus on the non-technical: people, processes, and policy aspects of information systems (IS). This research agenda offers notable contributions to the IS community. Although various reviews and opinions regarding AI research within the IS discipline have been proposed, such as Duan et al. (2019) and Dwivedi et al. (2019), there has been relative silence on how to explore the specific context of AI for environmental sustainability. We fill this critical gap and expect this work to foster debate on how AI can address this grand challenge. In addition, we respond to the need to approach IT from a socio-technical perspective (Beck et al., 2017). While AI is still widely viewed from a technical perspective, there is an increasing call to explore the social and ethical issues that surround this technology (Chia, 2019). We highlight various individual and social factors and propose specific directions regarding AI research and development. We hope our advice will guide researchers and practitioners in further contributing to this existential challenge.</p>
        <p>Next, we review the literature related to using AI applications for sustainability solutions, discuss related challenges, present our roadmap, and list propositions for research and practice, our main focus here. We conclude with a discussion on how researchers can leverage the research roadmap to contribute to leveraging AI for sustainability.</p>
        <p>The literature on AI for sustainability extends across many disciplines and domains and addresses environmental challenges. Biodiversity, water, energy, and transportation are rich areas of investigation for AI. Researchers have applied machine learning (ML) models to environmental, economic, and, to a lesser degree, social inquiry, particularly regarding climate change and smart cities, which are particularly fertile areas for AI research. For instance, ML models are used to predict stream flow and examine water quality parameters (Demirci et al., 2019). Water systems research has predominantly developed and tested ML models using techniques from linear regression, genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), autoregressive moving average model (ARMA), and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system or network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).</p>
        <p>Similarly, much biodiversity research has developed ML or natural language processing (NLP) solutions to predict ecosystem services, has modeled social media data to predict public opinion, and has modeled habitat suitability and availability for biodiversity conservation (Bagstad et al., 2016;Tuuli et al., 2019). In energy research, ANN, expert systems, pattern recognition, and fuzzy logic models are the main focus areas (Demirci et al., 2019;Tyralis et al., 2019). Energy use of buildings, energy production, energy distribution, operations and maintenance, and public opinion for renewable energy have been core areas of interest in this domain (González Ordiano et al., 2018;Merizalde et al., 2019;Wang and Srinivasan, 2017).</p>
        <p>Research to date has been primarily restricted to technical and design-oriented engineering disciplines that emphasize problem solving and technical solutions. Theory development regarding the use of AI for sustainability is scant, which provides an opportunity especially for researchers in the IS discipline. Focusing on AI for sustainability is the next logical step for the subdomain of green IS (IS for sustainability research) and will extend knowledge related to Green IS solutions.</p>
        <p>Next we present our literature review, drawn from the Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. We prioritized journal articles from 2015 to 2019, when studies on AI increased significantly (Lu, 2019). We also drew concepts and definitions from earlier literature.</p>
        <p>The term artificial intelligence (AI) is used to describe computerized abilities to solve problems and achieve goals. This ability can be regrouped into three categories:</p>
        <p>(1) Understanding and learning from external data (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2019); (2) AI systems attempt to imitate human cognitive functions such as vision and speech (Russell and Norvig, 2016); (3) AI systems tackle the complexities of human thinking and feelings (Martınez-Miranda and Aldea, 2005). Within each of these three categories, a variety of research themes are evident (Table 2-1). et al., 2019). Supervised learning is divided into regression and classification for numerical and categorical data. Popular supervised learning models include generalized linear models (GLM), support vector machine (SVM), decision trees (DT) including random forests, artificial neural networks (ANN), and Bayesian networks (BN). Some models are used for both regression and classification (Kotsiantis et al., 2007). Deep learning is gaining traction as a type of ANN with more layers of units (Shrestha and Mahmood, 2019).</p>
        <p>Natural computing (NC) is a broad field intersecting with AI. However, we view the application of NC algorithms to optimize ML models or to discover knowledge as a subset of ML. NC commonly involves developing algorithms that draw inspiration from the natural world, using natural material as computational media, and simulating natural phenomena in computers (Brabazon et al., 2015). For example, biological phenomena such as evolution, ecology, and swarm inspire optimization algorithms (Pandey and Nandi, 2016). Genetic algorithms (GA) are the most popular instance of evolutionary computation (EC) (Drugan, 2019). EC is also popularly applied to optimize ML models (Al-Sahaf et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) are emerging themes related to AI's capability to mimic human cognition. CV aims to analyze and understand realworld visual scenes (Szeliski, 2014). Major CV applications include feature extraction in images and videos (Buch et al., 2011), object identification and classification, such as in face recognition (Kumar et al., 2019) and perception of the surrounding environment as used in autonomous vehicles (Elliott et al., 2019). NLP applications seek to understand, recognize, or generate human language through text analysis (Kurdi, 2017). Semantic computing addresses content and user intention by integrating software engineering, user interface, and NLP (Sheu et al., 2009).</p>
        <p>Attempts to emulate human emotions and thinking through AI include affective computing, fuzzy logic, and expert systems. Affective computing empowers AI systems to recognize, understand, and express human feelings. Affective computing combines CV and NLP to allow machines to learn from speech and visual data (Poria et al., 2017). Fuzzy logic (FL), an approach to human reasoning, allows more values than the binary Boolean logic (Zadeh, 1975). A fuzzy inference system includes fuzzification, rule-based inference unit, and de-fuzzification stages, while adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) combines ANN and FL (Jang, 1993). Expert systems (ES) comprise databases, knowledge bases, and inference engines to solve complex problems based on specific knowledge and inference. A fuzzy ES is a natural combination of FL and ES (Medsker, 1995). Recent studies of ES have utilized ML models and FL to support decision making (Leo Kumar, 2019).</p>
        <p>The final theme we identified in the literature was AI robotics. Dimensions of human cognition, emotions, and thinking are combined to allow AI robots to perform human motions and manipulations. AI robotics have integrated CV, NLP, and AI emotions and decision-making for applications in manufacturing (Li et al., 2017) and medicine (Hamet and Tremblay, 2017).</p>
        <p>Although AI has not yet achieved human-level general intelligence, it has expanded broadly to include strategic planning, sequential actions (Ghallab et al., 2016), self-learning, and selfimprovement (Omohundro, 2007).</p>
        <p>In 1987, the concept of sustainability gained traction when the Brundtland Commission conceptualized it as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (WCED, 1987). The environment, economy, and society are identified as the three elements interrelated dimensions that contribute to achieving sustainability (Davidson, 2010;McKenzie, 2004;Morelli, 2011;Olawumi and Chan, 2018). The literature commonly takes a reductionist approach to deal with each element independently.</p>
        <p>Environmental sustainability is defined as "meeting the resource and services needs of current and future generations without compromising the health of the ecosystems" (Morelli, 2011). Concepts and topics include low-impact transportation, sustainable agriculture, and combinations of conservation of environmental assets (e.g., biodiversity, water resources, energy use, renewable energy, raw materials such as food and minerals, land-use sustainability), management of waste and pollution (e.g., waste reduction, recycling, reuse, repair, using environmentally responsible material, pollution monitoring, pollutant treatment (Callicott and Mumford, 1998).</p>
        <p>Research on AI for sustainability has explored many of those topics, and has focused on specific AI applications for enhancing biodiversity (Table 2-2). Rule-based systems such as ARIES 1 are popular for modeling ecosystem services. The software incorporates several ML models for data analysis to help researchers understand complex, nonlinear relationships (Death, 2015). With GA frequently used as an optimization technique, popular ML models for 1 http://aries.integratedmodelling.org/ biodiversity include ANN and BN (popular with modeling networks in ecosystems). Modeling competition and population ML Cellular automata Theoretical Kalmykov &amp; Kalmykov (2015) Public opinion ML, CV, NLP Content analysis Review Leak detection ML ANN Empirical Rojek &amp; Studzinski (2019) More than 250 publications from 2015 to 2019 applied AI to energy conservation and renewable energy. Because the area included so much work, Table 2-4 summarizes review articles since 2017, but not empirical or theoretical articles. ML to support forecasting and decision support are the primary components of AI applied to the major subdomains: energy production and distribution, energy planning and design, and operation and maintenance. ML algorithms are extensively used for forecasting in these subdomains (Olowu et al., 2018;Sobri et al., 2018;Youssef et al., 2017), and NC algorithms are used to solve multiobjective problems or generate optimal model parameters (Li et al., 2018). These algorithms are also integrated into FL systems for decision support related to forecasting or optimization (Liu et al., 2018). Ensemble models or hybrid models combine multiple models to produce more accurate results. Popular combinations include ANN with other models (statistical or time series), optimizing such models with NC algorithms (Wang and Srinivasan 2017).</p>
        <p>
            <rs type="software">M-Adaptive</rs> (software) Nuortimo &amp; Härkönen (2018) Other trends are also identified. First, cognition and robotics are largely overlooked components of AI. Some pattern recognition and classification methods were based on ML models such as ANN and clustering (Voyant et al., 2018), but researchers did not apply CV and robotics to expand the research. Second, renewable energy received much more traction than energy conservation. Third, most articles on renewable energy focus on only one type of renewable energy rather than hybrid energy sources. Solar is the most popularly studied renewable energy source. Only one article discussed public opinion about energy production (Nuortimo and Härkönen, 2018) and none examined financial feasibility of market deployment.
        </p>
        <p>Table 2-5 summarizes the research on AI applications related to sustainable transportation. Most articles narrowly focused on ML (Abduljabbar et al., 2019), but applications of CV and decision support were found in traffic management, traffic safety, public transportation, and urban mobility (Liyanage et al., 2019). Research in this domain mainly considered ML (ANN, DT, and conventional statistical and time series models) for traffic planning and control, and on-demand public transit (Liyanage et al., 2019). CV techniques were used for road marking, incident detection, and autonomous vehicles (Aymen and Mahmoudi 2019). FL decision support systems were applied to problems such as routing, fraud prevention, and mobility on-demand (Liyanage et al., 2019;Wen et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Besides focusing on AI applications related to resource conservation and environmental impacts related to activities such as transportation, studies examined AI applications for smart cities. Various attempts have been made to define smart cities and their dimensions (Albino et al., 2013), but they are broadly considered to be a more "livable and attractive urban environment within a smart and agile government" (Corbett and Mellouli 2017, p. 429). Six dimensions of a smart city are the economy, mobility, environment, people, living, and governance (Giffinger et al.,2007). Information technology (IT) is the essential infrastructure to improve public and private services, such as governance efficiency, business innovation, cultural development, and sustainability (Hollands, 2008). Big data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) can be analyzed by AI to support the governance, culture, and metabolism of a smart city (Allam and Dhunny, 2019) Table 2-6 summarizes studies on AI for sustainability in smart cities. ML is used for analyzing the big data collected through IoT and cognitive AI (CV and NLP). Knowledge-based AI has also been applied to smart cities (Aymen and Mahmoudi, 2019).

        <p>The literature review revealed that ML has been utilized extensively in AI solutions for sustainability. ML uses patterns and relationships observed in the historical data for learning and making predictions. A second issue with the historical data sets used in ML relates to variance-bias tradeoffs.</p>
        <p>ML practitioners often favor models that can be generalized to new data. However, if ML models manage variance by strictly fitting models to past data, they will inaccurately predict future scenarios in the highly dynamic climatic system. In contrast, if ML models are simplified and highly biased, they will always perform poorly for both training and test data. While variance-bias tradeoff is an inseparable part of the ML debate (Belkin et al., 2019), implications can be more pronounced for sustainability solutions. Considering that the climate crisis debate has such strong socio-political elements, predictions from such models can appear to be alarmist or to undermine threats. In either case, the models' technical limitations are attributable to other factors such as political ideologies or special interest lobbying that increase science-policy gaps and interfere with environmental governance. Thus, we must consider socio-technical perspectives to successfully leverage ML with historical data for climate prediction. While ML specialists continue to improve ML techniques, IS researchers can focus on interactions between ML models and decision makers who must make choices based on ML model predictions.</p>
        <p>Coordinated behavioral and policy responses are essential for developing climate crisis mitigation strategies. Although AI applications try to mimic the human decision-making process, they do not focus on human responses to decisions. For instance, the workings of the human brain inspired techniques such as deep learning (DL) and neural network (NN), but they are limited to exploring relationships between variables of interest rather than considering subsequent responses to outcomes. Thus, DL and NN models are often static and isolated, whereas the climate crisis and environmental degradation are complex issues entailing responses and interactions among human, ecological, political, economic, social stakeholders, and subsystems. The interconnections explain why we cannot use solely technical perspectives.</p>
        <p>Instead, AI must be approached from a socio-technical perspective that considers both human and artificial elements.</p>
        <p>A compelling example of interconnections between social and technical dimensions are rebound effects, identified initially by Jevons in 1865, occurring when savings paradoxically increase consumption and offset savings. For example, increased fuel efficiency increases fuel consumption. Many scientific and technological environmental innovations striving for ecoefficiency actually increased total consumption of limited resources (Herring and Roy, 2007;Nishant et al., 2014). Although rebound effects occur locally, they become more significant as the technology transforms consumer preferences, organizational processes, and social institutions. Without concerted efforts, AI is unlikely to avoid the trap of rebound effects suffered by other technological advancements. Thus, understandings of behavioral responses to climate crises are critical.</p>
        <p>Using AI techniques for environmental sustainability requires the integration of data sets from a wide range of data owners, formats, and structures. Heightened cybersecurity and data management risks require abilities to navigate data standards and integration protocols. Although siloed approaches minimize cybersecurity risks, they are inefficient and arguably, less effective.</p>
        <p>They must be integrated carefully to prevent hackers from gaining access to critical data (Meltzer, 2019). Recently, IT companies such as Google have showcased quantum computing that is significantly faster than the most powerful supercomputers. Although quantum computing will aid ML models and increase processing speed, it will also increase hacking speeds (Denning, 2019). Thus, increased cybersecurity threats are a potential consequence of developing integrated sustainability solutions. Cybersecurity risk management also requires effective policies, processes, and education at all levelsfrom individuals to society.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, current AI applications for sustainability have failed to adequately resolve these aspects, which typically fall under general data governance concerns.</p>
        <p>Although AI is a promising and powerful technology for sustainability, its application creates a huge carbon footprint, which represents a direct form of rebound effects. A single AI model training can emit carbon dioxide equivalent to the lifetime of five cars (Hao, 2019). As AI models become more complex, their carbon footprint increases drastically, assuming that energy sources remain the same. New approaches have been proposed for evaluating the environmental sustainability of software applications (e.g., Kern et al., 2018), but have not yet been widely adopted or applied to AI. Furthermore, AI models strongly depend on data and thus indirectly contribute to IT's global carbon footprint. AI models can spur huge energy-consuming datasets and big data centers. Beyond typical data center efficiency metrics such as PUE (power usage effectiveness), new frameworks and techniques are being developed that provide a more holistic, lifecycle models for measuring data center sustainability (e.g., Lykou et al., 2018). The research and practice community must leverage advances made in green software and infrastructures to anticipate potential environmental risks from AI (Watson et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>To advance in any meaningful way toward environmental sustainability, timely, precise, and accurate measurement and monitoring of interventions is required. Policy-makers, organizations, and society need to be able to see clearly the impact of intervention strategies in relation to established goals, such as the nine Planetary Boundariesfoot_0 or the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Such measurement is a highly challenging undertaking. Measuring IS performance has always been complex and often unsuccessful. For instance, in the building sector, expert decision-support tools are often widely inaccurate, while theoretical models fail to calibrate to the real world (Kolokotsa et al., 2016). Measuring both positive and negative impacts of AI solutions for sustainability will be doubly difficult (Crawford et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Appropriate metrics must go beyond purely technical dimensions. The success of AI for sustainability requires a holistic metric that combines technical and predictive performance models, measures acceptance by target audiences, and is cognizant of AI's technical limitations and the complexity of climate crises.</p>
        <p>IS scholars and practitioners have a unique opportunity to bring social science elements to a relatively technical topic and devise a new paradigm for solution-thinking. We propose five main research directions.</p>
        <p>The impact of AI on sustainability will transcend different units of analysis in a complex setting with social, technical, and political dimensions. For instance, AI applications in domains such as smart cities, which involve different dimensions of sustainability, should include individuals (citizens), technologies, firms, cities, as well as countries (Ismagilova et al., 2019). Hence, there is a pressing need to adopt a multilevel view in AI research. By a multi-level view, we mean research models (RM, distinct from AI models) that explore the interactions among different units of analysis from individuals to communities, state and national governments, and global organizations. A multilevel RM will include different units of analysis such as artifacts, individual, community, countries and will explore how much variance can be attributed to each unit. Even at the individual level, one has to take a microscopic view and explore the interaction among humans as well as between humans and different types of AI technologies.</p>
        <p>A multilevel approach will overcome a number of current limitations such as reductionism that we identified above. Advanced capabilities facilitated by AI can be better put to use if the RM underlying the mathematical model (which is used for training and testing) is more representative of the real world. Multilevel research will allow researchers and decisionmakers to better understand the complex nature of sustainability issues without resorting to reductionism. Multilevel RM are essential ingredients for better AI models. Multilevel RM can distinguish the explanatory power of different levels of analysis, which can help in avoiding variance-bias tradeoffs. Finally, with multilevel RM, researchers will be able to examine environmental sustainability in an integrated fashion with social and economic sustainability and, in this way, overcome limitations related to the uncertainty of human behavioral responses, unintended adverse consequences, and performance measurement. Therefore, we propose:</p>
        <p>Proposition 1: AI for sustainability should be viewed from a multilevel view, as a multilevel view will help to build better models by capturing the complexity inherent in the real world.</p>
        <p>Recent opinion pieces, such as Dwivedi et al. (2019), have categorized AI challenges into seven categories ranging from ethical to social. These challenges include cultural challenges, trust issues, judgment issues, and moral dilemmas. These challenges reflect interdependencies among various actors and reiterate the need to view AI as a socio-technical issue rather than merely a technical issue. Against this background, the system dynamics perspective (Forrester, 1961), developed almost a half-century ago, is highly relevant to AI for sustainability research and practice. The approach is used to model and simulate complex systems by incorporating the key elements and interdependencies. Given the many different ecosystem services, the natural environment is a complex dynamic system (Abdelkafi and Tauscher, 2016) that becomes even more complex when social, economic, and political human systems are included, as in the case with sustainability. AI researchers need to understand stakeholders' behavioral responses to environmental problems and the technological interventions that emerge from policy and market interventions. These interactions represent new areas of inquiry for IS researchers to advance the theory and practice of AI for sustainability. These interactions can result in feedback loops in the system. Adopting a systems dynamics perspective will allow AI for sustainability research to overcome limitations related to human behavioral responses that may create negative rebound effects, and allow AI to better inform environmental governance.</p>
        <p>The climate crisis is an emotional issue that sharply polarizes debates. Despite scientific evidence, there are still skeptics that dismiss climate change. As AI researchers and practitioners develop new applications at the interface of social, economic, and environmental domains, effectively communicating results from various AI-based models is key to fostering behaviors that help society mitigate and adapt to climate change. The extant research has focused on predicting stakeholders' acceptance of AI as a mechanism to support cooperation among agents in the community energy system (Mosavi et al., 2019;Wang and Srinivasan, 2017); however, ML models that incorporate complex system dynamics on environmental issues have evaded AI researchers. Communication is not a one-way street. Communication of results would lead to a response from different stakeholders and AI-based results have to, in turn, respond to the response from different stakeholders. Thus, researchers might investigate how AI attains equilibrium in a dynamic system with feedback loops, using a system dynamics perspective such as the 1972 Limits to Growth modelfoot_1 that simulates consequences of exponential population growth with limited resources. We propose:</p>
        <p>Proposition 2: AI for sustainability should be viewed from a system dynamics perspective, as a system dynamics perspective will capture interactions and feedback loops among the technology, users, and other stakeholders.</p>
        <p>As discussed previously, unintended adverse consequences are one of the potential problems of AI for sustainability. These consequences can include the technology's own contribution to carbon emissions and wastes, as well as other market or societal rebound effects. Unless conscious efforts are made, the environmental footprint of AI will increase with the increasing sophistication of techniques and complexity of models. As new sustainability practices unfold (e.g., electric vehicle use, smart cities), large data sets push the demand for large storage of data which would then require more data centers consuming higher levels of electricity to maintain the data centers. Hence, AI for sustainability has to be approached from a design thinking perspective to develop effective, net zero emission AI applications. The concepts of design-forthe-environment and eco-design (McDonough and Braungart, 2010) need to be extended to AI.</p>
        <p>There is a need to develop a comprehensive set of design principles for AI for sustainability.</p>
        <p>Design thinking, popularized by Stanford University, requires focusing the design of a product around the concerns, interests, and values of the users (Denning, 2013). Thus, design thinking methods combined with a participatory, in-field, design science research should be favored. In a participatory approach, researchers work with practitioners to create solutions to real-life problems. This allows for win-win outcomes as researchers gain access to new expertise and rich data, while practitioners benefit from having immediate access to new knowledge. Hence, we propose:</p>
        <p>Proposition 3: AI for sustainability should be approached from a design thinking approach, as a design thinking approach will help to minimize potential unintended consequences and improve the effectiveness of AI solutions.</p>
        <p>How human actors respond to AI is predicated on various psychological and sociological aspects. For instance, the displacement effect of AI, where the increases in output per worker arising from automation will not result in a proportional expansion in demand for labor (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018) depending on where an individual is situated within an organization, will influence people's acceptance of the technology and the extent to which AI is seen as threat to employment status and conditions. If the AI is meant to enable or extend an employee's opportunities, as we may see in an expert based AI application, then the overall morale and acceptance of AI may be high. However, if the employee's role and future employment is tied to a specific function that AI displaces, the social-psychological impacts of AI may be high.</p>
        <p>Besides psychology and sociology, the significance of economic rationales that will influence different responses to AI applications for sustainability cannot be ignored. Money is central to the way capitalist societies have evolved and function, therefore, the economic rationale will strongly influence how outcomes of AI-based models are perceived, accepted, and used.</p>
        <p>Consequently, there is a need to incorporate concepts from environmental economics, conventional economics, and behavioral economics to understand the power and limitations of AI in addressing environmental sustainability challenges. This research will fall under the broader IS value domain. Here, there has been a consistent debate whether IS leads to long-term value. The IS value literature recognizes that IS alone as ineffective in generating value and complementary assets as key to realizing value from IS (Shea et al., 2019). IS, therefore, should consider a portfolio and real options approach.</p>
        <p>The debate on the environmental value (Soomro et al., 2019) of IS is still not settled, as research in this area is in the nascent stage. AI, being a disruptive IS in terms of its unique characteristics to learn from data and new computational capabilities, brings new questions to the forefront. For instance, can we extend the IS value debate to AI, or does AI transcend traditional IS limitations? Addressing this question is critical to understanding the tangible impact of AI. If AI has transcended the limitations associated with traditional or legacy IS, it will overcome concerns related to productivity paradox (Brynjolfsson, 1993). Moreover, it will help to move society forward in terms of monitoring the potential unintended consequences of AI (e.g., rebound effects) and supporting performance measurement of AI solutions for sustainability.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we propose:</p>
        <p>Proposition 5: AI for sustainability should examine economic value to understand how it differs from conventional IS.</p>
        <p>We have developed propositions to guide future research on AI for sustainability. Now, we show that AI provides four practical opportunities.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the management and business literature has viewed environmental governance largely as a government-controlled responsibility for levying taxes, offering subsidies (e.g., Li et al., 2018), and setting regulations to enforce environmental protection and promote sustainable development. Thus government plays a key role in safeguarding AI's impacts on society (research proposition 12; Duan et al., 2019). However, the mindful use of AI systems can allow society to expand beyond these traditional levers for environmental governance. Alternative forms of governance, such as used in watershed management or forest management, reflect more comprehensive environmental governance where multiple parties with different interests interact (e.g., Kraft and Wolf, 2018). New forms of environmental governance can minimize self-interest by removing the bias of human emotions and information asymmetry. With the capabilities of AI to analyze vast sets of data and identify patterns beyond the recognition of human experts, reductionist approaches will no longer be required. Recently, AI (specifically using NN) created a simulation of the evolution of the universe over 600 million years (Starr, 2019). The simulation was quick and had a relatively low error rate. However, scientists cannot completely comprehend how the AI application achieved the results (Starr, 2019). This example illustrates the potential of AI, where AI simulated a complex system. Thus, AI can become autonomous, with checks and balances for managing risks and exceptions.</p>
        <p>AI presents an opportunity to leverage hardware and software to learn new ways of organizing industrial processes and global supply chains to reduce the water, energy, and land inputs associated with upstream commodity production, such as mining, oil, gas, and utilities, while reducing net contributions to carbon emissions. As a new opportunity to reduce operational costs of small and large industrial processes, AI is justified as an investment priority for multiple organizational performance outcomes.</p>
        <p>AI presents opportunities for operating in high-risk areas and environments, for advanced extraction techniques (e.g., space-based mineral extraction), and for managing highly volatile materials (e.g., nuclear waste) without risking human health. In other sectors, AI can identify factors that adversely or positively affect environmental performance. AI can also identify strategies to reduce emissions, water footprints, and bio-diversity risks, and to handle increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters.</p>
        <p>AI generally, and DL in particular, present exciting opportunities for organizational decision makers to leverage computation models such as game theory and agent-based models that can extend resource capabilities. Internet of Things (IoT) device integration provides real-time data that can be analyzed in settings that are most appropriate for learning and organizational sensemaking.</p>
        <p>Human activities are the greatest threats to environmental sustainability. We believe that AI offers a liberating opportunity to build systems of intelligence that will generate knowledge needed for preserving life. But for AI to deliver even a fraction of the potential benefits for sustainability, IS research must explore ways to circumvent limitations and conceptualize novel ways to leverage AI.</p>
        <p>AI cannot be a panacea for all our complex environmental sustainability problems. Historically new technologies have promised to solve immediate problems, but in time proved unsustainable.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we must recognize the limitations of this innovation, explore ways to circumvent some constraints, and conceptualize novel ways to leverage AI. Furthermore, the convergence of AI with other emerging technologies, such as blockchain, is expected to generate industry-wide benefits (Hughes et al., 2019). Thus, the ideas presented here also complements the research agenda proposed for other technologies that face similar issues, such as governance (Hughes et al., 2019). We hope that the ideas we have presented will provide useful directions for developing an understanding of the real value that AI can generate for generations to come.</p>

        <p>The Limits to Growth focuses on the computer simulation of exponential economic and population growth with a finite supply of resources (MacKenzie, D.</p>
