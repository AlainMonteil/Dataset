        <p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are multicomponent alloys with high concentrations of all alloying elements. Alloys within this new class of structural metal alloys demonstrate impressive combinations of properties such as high strength and high fracture toughness [1À4]. These attractive properties have driven an intense search for new alloys across the full range of number of components and composition. Designing new alloys or rationalizing alloy performance has, however, frequently relied on imprecise and non-quantitative concepts or correlations, such as "lattice distortions" [5À8], electronegativity differences [9] and others [10]. With a vast composition space available for alloy design, physically-based and quantitatively-predictive theories are needed to guide the search for better-performing alloys while understanding the limits of performance. In fact, such theories have recently been developed for predicting alloy yield strength [11,12] and have been shown to predict experiments across a range of HEA systems. The success of these theories indicates that the solute misfit volumes are the dominant factor in strengthening. This insight points toward new promising alloy compositions in different alloy classes [12À14]. Theoretical results to date are on only a narrow range of alloys, and no fcc alloys containing Vanadium (V) have been studied. However, experimentally, alloys containing the element V provide the highest strengthening in both fcc and bcc alloys.High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are multicomponent alloys with high concentrations of all alloying elements.

        <p>The primary experimental evidence for the role of V is revealed by examining two alloy families. In the fcc family of Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni-V, the medium-entropy alloy NiCoV [5] and the binary alloy Ni 0.632 V 0.368 [9] have recently been reported to have very high room temperature strengths as compared to all other alloys in this family. In the bcc refractory alloy family Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W, the MoNbTaVW has the highest retained strength at very high temperatures (T &gt; 1500 K) [15,16]. The fundamental origins of these extreme properties and their connections to the alloy composition were not previously established nor was the role of V as the critical element in both fcc and bcc recognized. Here, application of the new mechanistic models [11,12] for strengthening in fcc and bcc HEAs explains the origin of V's potency for strengthening in HEAs. In particular, we make new quantitative predictions for the NiCoV and Ni 0.632 V 0.368 fcc alloys in good agreement with experiments. These findings point toward future development of V-containing alloys as most promising for creating high strengths in both fcc and bcc alloys.The primary experimental evidence for the role of V is revealed by examining two alloy families.

        <p>High strength is not the sole requirement in alloy design. The high strength may compromise ductility, for instance. For V, the low melting point of Vanadium oxide may limit the application of V-containing alloys to non-oxidizing situations. However, these issues may also be overcome by tuning of other alloying elements or by engineering mitigation strategies such as protective coatings, enabling the exploitation of the high strength provided by V-containing alloys.High strength is not the sole requirement in alloy design.

        <p>The theoretical framework for understanding the special role of V is based on the fundamental interaction energy between a dislocation and the solutes that constitute the random alloy. In the random alloy, the random arrangement of solutes gives rise to spatially-fluctuating total interaction energies between the dislocation and the collective fluctuations in local solute concentrations. The dislocation becomes pinned in regions of favorable fluctuations, and this pinning is associated with high barriers for dislocation motion. These barriers are overcome only by high applied stresses and/or high temperatures. A new general theory for the strength of random alloys based on the motion of edge dislocations through the random alloy, and encompassing both fcc and bcc crystal structures and for arbitrary number of components and arbitrary composition, embodies the physics of the problem [11,12]. The full theory for the finite-T, finite-strain-rate initial yield strength of an alloy can be reduced to an approximate analytical model under the assumption that the solute/dislocation interaction energy U n of a type-n solute is governed by elasticity theory, i.e., U n ¼ÀpDV n ; where DV n is the misfit volume of the type-n solute (n ¼ 1; . . . ; N) in a N-component alloy and p is the pressure field generated by the dislocation at the solute position. The theory then predicts the zero-temperature shear yield stress t y0 and the energy barrier DE b for thermally activated flow asThe theoretical framework for understanding the special role of V is based on the fundamental interaction energy between a dislocation and the solutes that constitute the random alloy.

        <p>It is important to note several misconceptions related to the determination of misfit volumes that have arisen specifically in the study of V-containing alloys of interest here. First, the apparent volume of a solute is not the local Voronoi-volume around the solute in the lattice. The misfit volume involves distortions that extend to near-neighbor atoms and beyond, and the formal definition above (Eq. 3) encompasses all possible situations without the need to identify local atomic-scale details. Second, the misfit volume of a solute must be calculated in the alloy itself, or in an appropriate surrogate alloy having the same solute concentration. A misfit volume computed in a surrogate alloy in the dilute solute limit may be quite inaccurate because Vegard's law does not always hold with sufficient accuracy. Below, we will show the errors caused by these estimates of misfit volume in the case of V.It is important to note several misconceptions related to the determination of misfit volumes that have arisen specifically in the study of V-containing alloys of interest here.

        <p>We first consider the fcc Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni-V family of HEAs, i.e., adding V to the well-established Cantor alloy family. We have computed the atomic volume of fcc V as 13.914 A 3 using first-principles spin-polarized DFT as implemented in VASP [19], where PBE [20] is used as the exchange-correlation functional and the PAW [21] pseudopotential includes V (3s, 3p, 4s, 3d) as the valence states. (Detailed DFT parameters can be found in Ref. [14].) As shown in Table 1, this atomic volume is far larger than the apparent atomic volumes of the elements Ni, Co, Cr, Fe, and Mn as previously deduced from experiments on Ni, Ni-Co, Ni-Cr, and Ni-Fe binary alloys, and from Mn additions to various Co-Cr-Fe-Ni medium-entropy alloys [11]. To verify that the V atomic volume translates into a large misfit volume in Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni-V alloys, we have also performed DFT calculations to compute the misfit volumes in random Ni 2 V. In the DFT calculations, we compute the alloy atomic volumes of Ni-V alloys around the central composition, where c Ni spans from 0.630 to 0.704. Then linear regression is performed to the DFT-computed alloy atomic volumes, which gives V alloy ¼ 13:537À2:880c Ni with R 2 ¼ 0:997.

        <p>Overwhelmingly stronger are the NiCoV [5] and Ni 0.632 V 0.368 [9] alloys recently been fabricated and tested. For NiCoV, we use the reported isotropic elastic constants m ¼ 72 GPa, n ¼ 0:334 and predict the yield stress at T ¼ 300 K and _ ¼ 10 À3 s À1 to be 399 MPa. This is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 383 MPa obtained by extrapolating finite grain size data to infinite grain size. The theory then further indicates the Ni-V binary alloys will be the strongest, because the binary uses only the smallest (Ni) and largest (V) elements. Because the prediction also depends on the dislocation Burgers vector b ¼ a= ffiffiffi 2 p related to the alloy lattice constant a and the alloy elastic moduli, the optimal Ni-V binary alloy favors compositions below the equi-composition alloy.

Using the Hall-Petch slope of NiCoV (864 MPa ¢ mm 1/2 ) [5], the yield strength of Ni 0.632 V 0.368 at infinite grain size is estimated as » 450 MPa. This is again in good agreement with the theory.

The alloy composition is Co 10 Cr 15 Fe 35 Mn 5 Ni 25 V 10 , which is near the widely-studied equicomposition CoCrFeNi and Cantor alloys but with a relatively small addition of V. The yield strength for this alloy at a very small grain size of 5.2 mm was measured to be 498 MPa. Extrapolating to infinite grain size using the average scaling for the closely-related CoCrFeNi (860 MPa ¢ mm 1/2 ) [27] and Cantor alloy (494 MPa ¢ mm 1/2 ) [28] leads to an intrinsic strength of » 200 MPa. Application of the theory (Eq. 1 and 2) using the elastic moduli of the CoCrFeNi yields 199 MPa, as shown in Fig. 1. We predict that the same alloy without V, i.e., increasing all other components by 2 at.% for a composition Co 12 Cr 17- Fe 37 Mn 7 Ni 27 and with no change in elastic constants, would have a strength of only 113 MPa. By extrapolating to the infinite grain size, the experimental yield strength for the V-free CoCrFeNi and Cantor alloys are also only » 100 MPa [27] and » 125 MPa [28], respectively, with predicted strengths of 107 MPa and 111 MPa (see Fig. 1). Thus, again, V addition, even at a smaller (but non-dilute) concentration of 10 at.%, provides a large ( » 76%) increase in strengthening relative to the V-free counterparts, and the theory predicts this strengthening.To show the role of V more broadly, we examine another V-containing alloy recently fabricated and tested [26].

        <p>Turning to the bcc alloys, the atomic volumes of the bcc elements Cr, Mo, Nb, Ta, V, W have been measured experimentally [29], as shown in Table 2. Experimental studies of the lattice constants of various HEA alloys composed of these elements plus alloys containing Hf enable the estimation of Hf apparent volume based on Vegard's law [30]. For Ti and Zr, which exist in the bcc structure only at high temperatures, extrapolations are carried out to estimate the apparent volumes at room temperature [31,32]. Here, V stands out as the second-smallest element, with only Cr being smaller. However, Cr is smaller than V in both fcc and bcc and so although Cr can be potent for bcc alloys it is not nearly as effective as V in fcc alloys (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, fabrication of single-phase random bcc alloys containing Cr can be challenging due to the strong tendency of Cr to form embrittling intermetallic compounds. Only V is predicted to provide substantial strengthening in both fcc and bcc alloys.Turning to the bcc alloys, the atomic volumes of the bcc elements Cr, Mo, Nb, Ta, V, W have been measured experimentally [29], as shown in Table 2.

        <p>The role of V in bcc alloys is first revealed through a comparison of the refractory alloys MoNbTaW and MoNbTaVW, which differ only by the addition of V replacing 5 at.% of each of the other 4 elements. The predictions of the theory and the experimental strengths versus 1) and ( 2)). The atomic volume of V as determined from Ni 2 V is used in all V-containing alloys. The refined theory prediction of NiCoCr is based on anisotropic elasticity and the experimentally measured misfit volumes. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) temperature, as reported recently [12], are shown in Fig. 2. The V-containing alloy has a significantly higher strength over the entire temperature range. This is in spite of the fact that V has the lowest melting point of all of these elements, and elastic moduli that are » 10% lower than the 4-component alloy. The role of V is thus central to obtaining very high strength, as predicted. Many other bcc alloys in the Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W family also have high strengths, but there are no V-free counterparts in the literature; the theory predictions are consistent with these high strengths [12].The role of V in bcc alloys is first revealed through a comparison of the refractory alloys MoNbTaW and MoNbTaVW, which differ only by the addition of V replacing 5 at.% of each of the other 4 elements.

        <p>Examining other bcc alloy pairs where V is added, strengthening is found in all alloys. Fig. 2 summarizes results reported in Miracle-Senkov [3], Couzini eÀMiracleÀSenkovÀDirras [33], Senkov et al. [34], and Rao et al. [35]. In general, the predictions of the V-containing alloys are in good agreement ( »15%) with the experiments. However, our predictions for the V-free alloys can be notably lower than experiments. One possible explanation is that there is a change from control of the alloy strength by edge dislocations (with V) to screw dislocations (without V) in some alloys. In addition, our predictions for MoNbTa-TiW both without and with V are lower than experiments. This could be attributed to the possible presence of high (1À2 at.%) interstitial Oxygen and/or Nitrogen content, which was recently shown to increase strength by » 400 MPa at 2 at.% interstitial O or N (and usually causing embrittlement, see [36]). The presence of O and N could be particularly associated with the presence of Ti, consistent with experimental observations of increased strength upon Ti additions in some bcc alloys. Overall, in spite of some quantitative differences, all of the experimental evidence on bcc alloys points to the role of V in achieving high strength, as compared to other alloy additions. Within the Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W family, the theory further predicts that alloys Ta 0.33 V 0:33þx W 0:33Àx with À0:1 &lt; x &lt; 0:1 will have the highest intrinsic strengths at high temperatures by taking advantage of both the large V misfit volume and the high stiffness of W. This prediction should drive experimental investigations of these alloys.Examining other bcc alloy pairs where V is added, strengthening is found in all alloys.

        <p>In summary, many new fcc and bcc high-entropy alloys have been fabricated with V as one of many elements, and these alloys have high strengths relative to their counterparts without V. However, the critical role of V has not been recognized or understood. The centrality of solute misfit volumes, over all other material properties, is revealed through recent theory for strengthening in these complex random alloys. The uniqueness of V then follows from its atomic volume in fcc and bcc crystals: larger in fcc and smaller in bcc than other HEA alloying elements, creating large misfit volume and high strengthening in both fcc and bcc alloys. This singular feature of V makes it the prime element for use as a strengthener in both fcc and bcc HEAs, both as measured and as predicted by theory. While strength is not the only application requirement, and the lowtemperature formation of Vanadium oxide may limit applications of V-containing alloys in some situations, the general insight revealed here, along with the theoretical models, can drive experimental alloy design centered around V as a key elemental component.
