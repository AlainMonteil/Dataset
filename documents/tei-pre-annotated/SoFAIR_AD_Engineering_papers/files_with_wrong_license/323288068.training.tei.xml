        <p>While halide perovskite allows a great versatility, the application on single absorber solar cells restrings significantly the number of available materials. In this context, CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 (FA, formamidinium) present a huge potentiality for the inorganic nature with enhanced stability the former and the narrow bandgap the later. However, for these materials, Cs + and FA + are too small and too big relatively, to stabilize the perovskite black phase at room temperature, presenting both a yellow phase non-photoactive as the most stable phase. This fact limits dramatically their application and also help to understand the main research lines in halide perovskite photovoltaics field as the quest for the stabilization of FAPbI3. In this perspective, we overview different strategies for the stabilization of the perovskite black phase of these two materials. We evaluate the stability approaches envisioning efficient and stable materials, with a particular focus to the positive and limiting aspects of the low dimensionality and chemi-structural mechanisms exploitation.</p>
        <p>After one decade of intensive work in the halide perovskite field, the versatility of ABX3 formulation has given rise to a plethora of materials and applications. However, the especial requirements for photovoltaic applications in terms of bandgap, low non-radiative recombination, good transport and long term stability, significantly limits the range of materials available. Narrow bandgap limits the choice of the halide X to I -and the low non-radiative recombination for the moment is limiting B to Pb 2+ . In this context the choice of A in order to obtain a 3D material with good transport properties is basically restricted to Cs, methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA). 1 Cs and FA halide perovskites (HP) ride the wave to overpass the established methylammonium based perovskite. [2][3][4] The interest in these cations originates mostly from the inorganic nature with enhanced stability of the former and from the low bandgap of the latter (1.48 eV for FAPbI3 vs 1.73 eV for CsPbI3). 5 Nonetheless, this potentiality could not be fully developed due to the low stability at room temperature of the optically active perovskite black phase of these materials. The photoactive cubic α-phase quickly transforms into the non-perovskite strain free yellow δ-phase, hexagonal for FAPbI3 or orthorhombic for CsPbI3, resulted from an anisotropic strain in a preferential plane of the α-phase lattice at room temperature. 6 Iodide perovskites exhibit different optically active polymorphs α-(cubic), β-(tetragonal) and γ-(orthorhombic) black phases, but at room temperature, the δ-yellow phase is the one with the lowest free energy of formation in the case of CsPbI3 and FAPbI3. [7][8] By raising up the temperature, the photoinactive δ-phase can be directly converted in the α-phase, expanding the volume of unit cell.</p>
        <p>Marronnier et al. associated this phase transition to the increase of dynamic motion of [PbI6] 4- octahedra, promoting the connectivity with them. 9 Considering the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) 10 and the globularity factor, 1 the energy involved in the process is expected to be higher in order to induce the corner-sharing octahedral geometry when small cations as Cs + (t &lt; 0.8) are incorporated into the A-site. Conversely, larger cations as FA + (t &gt; 1) requires lower energies to retain the cubic structure. Thus, the optically active black phase α-CsPbI3 is obtained at T = 300-360 °C, 11 while the α-FAPbI3 is attained at T = 150-185 °C. 12 Although MA + cation (0.8 &lt; t &lt; 1) as well is demonstrated to favor the formation of an optical black phase (T = 100 °C), MAPbI3 is thermally less stable than pure FAPbI3 or CsPbI3 even under air-absent conditions at T &gt; 85 °C. This fact occurs due to the MA + sublimation, and in turn it is not the best candidate in terms of long-term stability. 13 Even though the black phase of the iodide perovskites is able to prevail after their corresponding synthesis, the unavoidable formation of metastable phases occurs after cooling down process and during their storage, where moisture accelerates the conversion to the yellow phase, 14 that is also influenced by the grain size. 15 The mechanisms involve the hydrolysis of the perovskite and the weak interaction between the cation and the iodide of the inorganic octahedra. The formamidinium cation with water dissociates in ammonia and sym-triazine, 16 while cesium is intrinsically more stable, being inorganic. In this case the main instability reason lies in its relatively low tolerance factor (&lt;0.8). In both the cases the contraction of the lattice, favoring the interactions between the organic and inorganic moieties, is the current strategy to improve their moisture stability.</p>
        <p>At low temperature, the applied energy for dynamic motion decreases, breaking the symmetry of cubic structure of connected [PbI6] 4-cages, originated from the octahedral tilting. 17 In this context, the high-symmetry lattice of black phase iodide perovskite is distorted by decreasing the Pb-I-Pb tilting angle (ϕ). For instance, α-CsPbI3 (ϕ = 180 °) converts to β-CsPbI3 (ϕ = 164 °) when T decreases to 265 °C, γ-CsPbI3 (ϕ = 153 °) is reached at 175 °C, 18 while in the case of the FAPbI3 the and phases are formed at very low temperature (-122°C and -182°C respectively), see Figure 1. 8 In an ideal active component of an optoelectronic device, long-term ambient degradation cannot be absolutely avoided, as it is inherently coupled with the use in ambient atmosphere, whereas the detrimental thermodynamical stability has no justification and should be minimized.</p>
        <p>Consequently, for mitigating the black to yellow phase transition of CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 different strategies have been addressed. The literature has reported three main approaches 19 : i) the synthesis of low dimensional perovskite materials, like nanocrystals (NCs). Specifically, the high surface/volume ratio in perovskite NCs (PNCs) is the key factor to attain an enhanced crystalline phase stability compared to their bulk counterpart at room temperature. Thus, the black α-phase in PNCs is stable at room temperature. 20 In this context, the formamidinium based NCs [21][22] are emerging as red emitters, as an alternative to the more consolidated cesium based NCs. ii) Compositional engineering, the most extended strategy, where the too small or too big size of Cs + and FA + cations, respectively, is compensated by the combination of cations and anions of different sizes. Even more components are added in order to obtain black phase stability, 23 where the popular multication/multianion formulation Cs0.05MA0.16FA0.79Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 is a clear model. 24 This strategy has been very effective as since 2014, all the record perovskite solar cells have been attained with multicomponent perovskites, 25 where the FA + cation is the main component of the different formulations. However, this approach implies the increase of the perovskite bandgap and the loss of the light harvesting in the NIR region. iii) The addition of external additives has been reported to stabilize the α-phase, and to improve the optoelectronic properties. Traditional additives are bulky cations that enables the formation of a 2D/3D perovskite phases, a successful alternative to the 3D perovskite. 26 In some cases the original bandgap could be preserved, 27 and at the same time could passivate defects, leading to improved devices performance. 26 However, additives can also act as cross-linking agents acting at the grain boundaries, reducing the surface energy, like in the case of the bifunctional salt of the ammonium valeric acid iodide (AVAI) 28 or the alkylphosphonic acid ωammonium cation. 29 Likewise, sulfobetaine zwitterions are used as chemical stabilizer for the CsPbI3 bulk films, leading to the formation of small and more stable grains. 30 Very recently, the use of PbS QDs is also demonstrated to stabilize the black phase of both the cesium 31 and formamidinium 32 iodide perovskites, due to the similar lattice parameters between the two materials, where the PbS acts as a template, heading the growth of the perovskite where the combination of different chemistructural effects contributes to the stabilization of the FAPbI3 black phase, 32 as it will be analyzed below.</p>
        <p>All these strategies in conclusion evince a control of the lattice strain, correlated with an increase of the vacancy formation energy and in turn with an increase of the stability. [33][34] The enormous interest of CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 and these premises have encouraged still more the synthesis optimization of nanoconfined perovskites in order to take advantage of surface energy and of the strain exploitation to stabilize the perovskite black phase of these materials. 32 By understanding the correlation between nanocrystal size, lattice strain and energy favorability of the different perovskite phases, critically assessed in this perspective, a development toward stable and optimal bandgap materials is likely to be observed in the imminent future.</p>
        <p>Moreover, stable perovskite nanocrystals, allowing for exciton and photon confinement, 35 and stable bulk perovskite, due to its high absorption coefficient, 36 will bring paramount profits either to the photovoltaic (PV) 25 or to the electroluminescent field (EL). 37 Perovskite Nanocrystals. PNCs have attracted an enormous interest for optoelectronics, due to their mesmerizing photophysical properties as high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), narrow emission widths and tunable bandgap over the UV-IR spectra, obtained with a relatively easy synthesis processes. 38 Colloidal PNCs with tunable properties can be prepared by harnessing the composition engineering and particle size modulation (quantum confinement effect). 39 Reducing the perovskite size, the contribution of the surface energy (Esurf) on the PNC energy formation (Gibbs free energy, EPNC) becomes larger than that of bulk energy (Ebulk). This fact decreases the δ-to-α-phase temperature transition. 40 The relationship between EPNC, Ebulk and Esurf is given for the following equation: 41</p>
        <p>where d is the diameter of PNC, and Vo is the unit cell volume. When PNCs display sizes near to bulk particles, EPNC is dictated by Ebulk while Esurf is almost negligible. [41][42] However, by increasing the surface area/volume ratio during the formation of PNCs, the number of atoms on the material surface increases and Esurf governs EPNC. [43][44] Esurf of α-and γ-CsPbI3, estimated by DFT calculations, are 1.2 and 4.0 meVÅ -2 , respectively, while δ-CsPbI3 presents a larger value around 7.5 meVÅ -2 . 41 Accordingly, the more negative the Esurf, the more negative the EPNC, from which the stabilization of the black phases in CsPbI3 and FAPbI3</p>
        <p>PNCs.</p>
        <p>Yang et al. 41 have also described the propensity to form α-, γ-and δ-CsPbI3 PNCs in function of the PNC diameter, see Figure 2a. For d values larger than 5.6 nm, δ-CsPbI3 is longer favored, while for d values smaller than 5.6 nm, γ-CsPbI3 is energetically more stable than δ-yellow phase. Further</p>
        <p>The enormous interest of CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 have encouraged still more the synthesis optimization of nanoconfined perovskites, harnessing surface energy and strain exploitation to stabilize the perovskite black phase.</p>
        <p>decreasing d to 3.7 nm, α-CsPbI3 is thermodynamically stabilized and this phase governs the crystalline structure of iodide perovskite with d below 2.7 nm. Therefore, the formation of the αand γ-phases in the PNCs is thermodynamically more favorable than the inactive δ-phase structure when the PNC size is under nanoscale regime. Conversely, when the PNC size is closer to bulk compounds, the δ-yellow phase is preferred. The limiting aspects of the high surface area/volume ratio is the higher chance to generate surface defects. Despite the defect tolerant structure of the perovskite, proved by the high PLQY, 45 firstly the surface defects act as traps for the photogenerated carriers, compromising the optoelectronic properties, and secondly they contribute to the degradation of the material. To solve this issue, either the healing of the lead iodide octahedra or the control of the chemical equilibria with the surrounding capping ligands are exploited, ultimately improving the stability of the NCs. 46 However, from the point of view of the device application, the long insulating organic chain hinders the charge transport, so a careful control of washing procedure to reduce the ligands but at the same time to preserve the stability is contemplate during the device fabrication. The excess of oleic acid during the NCs preparations allows to reach the certified record PCE of the NCs solar cells of 16.6%, using PNCs Cs0.5FA0.5PbI3. 47 Despite the PCE of pure CsPbI3 NCs based solar cells is lower (14.3%) 48 compared to the 18.4% obtained with the bulk perovskite (Table 1), 49 the use of PNCs instead of the bulk perovskite present some advantages as the enhanced black phase stability, demonstrated for the pure FAPbI3 (Figure 2d, Table 1), 44 or the possibility of creating heterojunctions, exploiting the layer by layer depositions. 50 Thus, the most stable PNCs will be the one where the low dimension is attended with the absence of defects.</p>
        <p>The high surface area/volume ratio is also a cause of the compressive strain generation in the perovskite lattice. 20,51 This effect hampers the octahedral tilting of the material surface, providing more symmetric structures at ambient temperature. Thus, the generation of the non-perovskite δyellow phase structure, that requires an expansion in the unit cell volume, is thermodynamically avoided under nanoconfinement, as the energy barrier to promote the phase transformation increases (Figure 2b). 40,52 Nonetheless, the reversible phase transitions between α-, β-and γ-black phases that occurs into the confined PNCs, due to the slight distortion of the lattice, is less sensitive to the reduction of particle size. These reasons explain the long-time black phase stability of CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PNCs both in colloidal solution and in thin film, 20,38,44 being photoactive for months even under air conditions, see Figure 2c,d. With these evidences, it is clear that a strong spatial confinement (internal, colloidal NC, external, or size restricted by a template) lead to achieve less distorted CsPbI3 structure in films, 53 and more stable PNCs. 31 An alternative procedure to lock the formation of the undesired non-photoactive δ-yellow phase in the iodide perovskites is through the use of nanopore templates or scaffolds. 40,43,[54][55][56] This approach has been reported to be efficient for confining the perovskite crystal growth by applying physical microstrain, which alters the phase energy free formation. Therefore, the metastable black phases are stabilized at room temperature, keeping their crystal structure even under their decomposition temperature. 40 For instance, Zhao et al. estimated by DFT calculations that γ-CsPbI3 black phase is preferred over δ-CsPbI3 (Figure 3) by extending the surface area greater than 8.6 x 10 3</p>
        <p>The most stable PNCs will be the one where the low dimension is attended with the absence of defects.</p>
        <p>m 2 mol -1 . 52 On the other hand, Ma et al. 43 demonstrated through XRD measurements that the dimensions of the template dictate the strain level to confine the perovskite growth. The microstrain was varied from 1.1 % when CsPbI3 was grown into a 69 nm-pore sized anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) template to 2.0 % by growing the iodide perovskite into a 30 nm-pore sized AAO template.</p>
        <p>A microstrain value higher than 1.9 % promotes the stabilization of the α-phase. It is worth noting that the application of a minimum compressive strain stabilizes the photoactive black phase even if the surface area of the confined perovskite decreases. By using DFT calculations, the generation of 2.0 % and 2.5 % of microstrain reduce the surface area from the critical value (1.96 × 10 5 m 2 mol -1 )</p>
        <p>to lower values than 1.82 and 1.75 × 10 5 m 2 mol -1 , respectively, decreasing the phase free energy formation in favor of the α-phase instead of the δ-phase. 43 Definitively, the synthesis of nanoconfined materials is a relevant strategy to be considered during the processing of black-phase iodide perovskites at room temperature, as their intrinsic properties remain basically unchanged.

        <p>Compositional engineering. Since its first fabrication report, 57 FAPbI3 showed an enormous potentiality for the development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), due to its potential higher stability in comparison with MAPbI3 and its narrower bandgap. Black phase FAPbI3 perovskite has in fact the lowest bandgap of the APbI3 family, 58 1.48 eV, corresponding to a maximal theoretical photoconversion efficiency (PCEmax) of 32.3%, 59 and consequently it is a priori the most attractive option for single absorber solar cell preparation. However, initial report 57 also highlighted the presence of a yellow polymorph that should be avoided in order to obtain efficient PSCs. Hereafter, most of the compositional work developed in PSCs can be seen as a continuous fight for the stabilization of FAPbI3.</p>
        <p>The researchers stabilized FAPbI3 adding smaller cations as MA + or Cs + . In fact, the strategy of mixing FA + with other cations have been very successful and the most efficient PSCs have a formamidinium-based perovskite active layer, combined with other cations, such as methylammonium (MA + ), 60 cesium (Cs + ), [61][62] potassium (K + ) 63 or large organic cations forming 2D perovskites. [64][65] For instance, adding certain amounts of Cs + cations into the FAPbI3, is a way to obtain a stabilized FA1-xCsxPbI3 alloy at room temperature 66 with an increase of the reproducibility if the Rb + is also incorporated. 2 As the size of Cs + is smaller than the one of FA + , the tolerance factor is tuned to a suitable region where the black-α-phase cubic structure is attained. The ionic radius of the Cs + is smaller than the one of the FA + , 1.8 Å and 1.9-2.22 Å respectively, thus by mixing FA + with MA + or Cs + the tolerance factor decreases between 0.8 &lt; t &lt;1. 67 Based on the same reasoning by mixing the halides like Br -and Cl -t is reduced. 68 In this way it is possible to foresee the best combination to obtain a stable black phase. Small cations alone, like the K + (ionic radius 1.14 Å) or</p>
        <p>Rb + (ionic radius 1.15 Å) have not adequate dimensions to compensate the stoichiometry reduction of big cations like MA + or FA + , but they are employed in a very effective "cation cascade", to assist in the modification of the crystal lattice of mixed cation/mixed halide perovskite, being responsible for an higher stability to the materials. However a higher amount of Cs + or Rb + generates a phase segregation, with the formation of CsPbI3 or RbPbI3, due to the large lattice mismatch. 67 Eventually, the mixed cation halide perovskite is transformed into the non-perovskite δ-phase. In the same way a stable α-phase of the mixed halide perovskite, 69 for instance CsPbBr3-xIx, can be reached after adding 33 % Br into perovskite lattice. 38 However, this strategy also has a drawback, as the introduction of MABr salt, produces the blue shift of the FAPbI3 bandgap moving it away from the optimal value in terms of PCEmax. 59,70 For example, the popular multianion/multication Cs0.05MA0.16FA0.79Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 presents a bandgap of 1.63 eV 24 limiting PCEmax to 29.8%. 59 Recently, different groups are trying to reduce the perovskite bandgap removing Br -. 2,60 This strategy has the current PCE published record of 23.3% 60 with the reduction of bandgap limited to 1.55 eV as 8% of MA + has to be added to stabilize the black phase of FAPbI3. The use of Cs + instead of MA + to stabilize the FAPbI3 perovskite black phase in MA-free RbCsFAPbI3 allows to reduce the bandgap to 1.53 eV. 2 All these results show that the manipulation of perovskite lattice parameters by the addition of alternative cations and anions has the positive effect of the black phase stabilization but unfortunately, in the case of Pb-perovskites, smaller A-site cation produces octahedral tilting resulting in an increased bandgap. 71 Addition of external additives. The drawback of bandgap blue-shift by the utilization of compositional engineering for the stabilization of perovskite black phase have boost the use of different additives for the stabilization with a minimum impact on the bandgap. Instead of the common MABr salt, a new additive, the methylenediammonium dichloride (MDACl2) is exploited, taking advantage from the more amount of hydrogen bonding that the cation MDA + is able to create, and from the wellknown stabilizing role of the Cl -. 3 Along with the MDACl2, the MACl salt is employed as sacrificial additive. The MACl salt degrades during the perovskite formation, leading to a very low amount of extra halide that has a marginal impact on the bandgap of the formamidinium based perovskite.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that the low Cl -amount not only reduces the lattice strain and passivates the interstitial vacancies, but more important has an effective role on the reduction of the lattice parameter of triple halide perovskite, 72 the origin of an increased stability of the -phase. The role of the MACl salt is also consolidated, as its amount is increased up to 20% 73 and the bandgap of the perovskite is not shifted: the MACl salt is in fact only located at the grain boundaries, acting as external additive for improving the crystallinity of the formamidinium perovskite.</p>
        <p>An alternative additive used to stabilize the formamidinium black phase is the above mentioned AVAI, 28 already used for the stabilization of the MAPbBr3 and the FASnI3, confirming the role of the hydrogen bonding in the thermodynamic stabilization, with the novelty that in this case the original bandgap is even slightly red-shifted, allowing to mention it as external additive not incorporated in the crystalline perovskite structure, with no limiting effects on the bandgap.</p>
        <p>One strategy in this line is to take benefit from strain. Beyond PNCs, also bulk polycrystalline perovskite films have shown a certain degree of strain, that is reduced when island are formed instead of continuous films. 74 The role of the strain is still under investigation and could be positive or negative towards the perovskite stabilization. Interestingly, most of the literature around the strain focused on materials bearing MA + , 75 likely because it was the most extensively studied in photovoltaics. Cs + is often explored in the case of colloidal nanocrystals, 38 while FA + was studied in deep only in the last few years due to its favorable bandgap, 32,57 whereas the use of other cations such as guanidinium [76][77] is only slightly explored in the field.</p>
        <p>As above mentioned, the strain depends on the tilting of the [PbI6] 4-octahedra, easily tuned by the formation of hydrogen bonding between the organic cation and external additives, a very</p>
        <p>The manipulation of perovskite lattice parameters by the addition of alternative cations and anions produces octahedral tilting resulting in an increased bandgap.</p>
        <p>common approach in the field: the hydrogen bonding determine the orientation of the organic counterpart, that in turn rearrange the tilting of the octahedra. 78 On the other hand, the strain can lead to a faster degradation of the film due to the improved ion migration. 79 This effect occurs when the strain originates from the thermal expansion mismatch of the perovskite lattice parameter with the substrates. 79 However it has been demonstrated that the control of the strain contributes to the stabilization of the -phase of the formamidinium (Figure 4 e-f) or cesium perovskite film when the PbS QDs are embedded in the FAPbI3 matrix, as a chemical bonding between the PbS and perovskite in the black phase is successfully formed, see Figure 4 e-h. 32 Thus either in the case of the CsPbI3 7 or in the FAPbI3 32 the balanced strain leads to stable materials. The perovskite metastable crystal phase mimicking the PbS lattice parameters and auto-tuning its tolerance factor, falls down in the stability region and improves the solar cells performances. [31][32] The PbS QDs with lattice parameters close to the one of the perovskite, have been a pioneering choice to demonstrate the positive effect of the strain on the stability, above all if strong chemical bonds between the additive and the desired perovskite phase are created, 32 and alternative rock-salts structure or additives will be in the future to address different circumstances.</p>
        <p>Others contributions out of the bare strain have been investigated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation, underlining that only a relatively stabilization is achieved in view of the strain (Figure 5 i). The surface energy created by the interface between FAPbI3 and PbS QDs (Figure 5 ii) and the chemical bonds between both materials (Figure 5 iii) are additional chemi-structural effects in order to stabilize the perovskite black phase (Figure 5 iv). 32 colors, respectively, (ii) the effect of strain on the bulk when matching the PbS lattice, (iii) the presence of surfaces in the slabs, and (iv) the role of chemical binding to the PbS substrate in the heterojunctions. The insets depict the atomic structures under study, which are 3D in (i) and (ii) and 2D in (iii) and (iv). Reproduced with permission from ref. 32 Copyright 2020 American Chemistry Society.</p>
        <p>The strain coming from the FAPbI3 accommodation with the lattice parameters of the PbS destabilizes both the black and yellow phases, but the effect is more prominent for the yellow phase;</p>
        <p>hence the relatively stabilization of the perovskite black phase (Figure 5 ii). In addition, the PbS introduction creates new surface energies, which mostly increase the thermodynamic energy of the yellow phase (Figure 5 iii). Finally the chemical bonds creation between the black phase and the PbS is the main mechanism for the definitive stabilization of the perovskite (Figure 5 iv).</p>
        <p>This analysis is a comprehensive picture of the stabilization mechanisms, that paves the way for the investigation also of the chemical interaction between the additive and the yellow phase, that often could be under evaluated, to foresee the best additive for the black phase stabilization along with the destabilization of the photoinactive phase.</p>
        <p>All the above mentioned strategies and mechanisms have two parallel consequences, the discussed stabilization of the cesium and formamidinium black perovskite phase and the desired holding of the FAPbI3 bandgap, resulting in turn in stable and high efficiency optoelectronic devices (Figure 6, Table 1). From Figure 6, it is easy to appreciate that longer stabilization times have been reported for FAPbI3 than for CsPbI3, for both bulk and NCs. In the case of photovoltaic devices prepared with bulk black phase FAPbI3 present higher performance than CsPbI3 as it could be expected from the narrower bandgap of the former. Nevertheless, in the case NCs, CsPbI3 NC based solar cells outperform the performance of devices based in FAPbI3 NCs. Indicating that further improvement in the later kind if NCs is required, perhaps because FAPbI3 NCs have been less studied in the literature. However, it should be important to determine if there is an intrinsic limitation in FAPbI3 NCs for further developments. Furthermore, the compressive strain can lead to a structural compression, which stabilizes the perovskite material. The N-dimethylformamide in acid conditions for the growth of the MAPbBr3, 80 or the PbS QDs for FAPbI3 32 have yield this effect. Consequently, the perovskite emission properties see Figure 7a-d, and the stability in humid conditions 80 are improved. However each time a compressive and unidirectional strain favors the formation of stable perovskite a tensile strain be in the perpendicular direction, pushing the perovskite in a state of non-equilibrium. [81][82] This phenomenon also could potentially limit the obtainment of an efficient and stable optoelectronic devices; 83 however, because recent research has focused on this topic, we expect that such a limitation could be surpassed with forthcoming strain engineering. In this frame, the chemi-structural mechanisms, taking into account strain but also interfaces and chemical bonds among different materials, will be the future way to stabilize the perovskite desired photoactive phases, or to develop the formation of new phases. 82 Another limitation deals with how the strain affects the local recombination, 84 sometimes a challenging analysis due to the heterogeneity of the perovskite structure, that induced mistake in the interpretation of the optoelectronic data collected. An example of these controversies, regards the generation of defects, is the PL quenching observed on CsPbI3, 31 despite previous investigation reported reduced detrimental impact of the PbS QDs in MAPbI3 matrix, or even a beneficial one. 85 In the same way, the PL increases in compressed crystals of MAPbBr3, 80 but not in the microdomains of the MAPbI3 polycrystalline film, 84 see Figure 7e-i. Reasonably the radiative deactivation depends on the specific kind of defects present at the boundary, with its particular chemi-structural surrounding. As the FAPbI3 needs implements to improve the stability, strain and different chemical interactions concerns cannot be eluded. 32 Then the homogeneous propagation of the interactions, as demonstrated by embedding the PbS QDs in the perovskite matrix, is highly desired. In this contest, one of the consequence of the epitaxial growth, taking place from the bulk, like in the case of PbS QDs additives and not from an external substrates, could be the non-radiative recombination reduction in the whole bulk structure.</p>

        <p>Finally, to achieve the thermodynamic stability remains the real challenge for the photoactive perovskite materials. The black phase perovskite stability needs to be finely mastered for achieving stable crystal structure with controlled defects, as a first step to the further development of reproducible and stable devices based on CsPbI3 and FAPbI3. Among the different methods, the exploitation of the low dimensionality (NCs or 2D/3D perovskite), the use of external additives (PbS colloidal QDs) and the use of specific ions (Cl -or the Rb + ) in mixed cation/halide perovskite, represent the most emerging and significant strategies. Therefore it is expects that in perspective, the combination of these aspects finally will lead to an improvement in materials and devices stability. In detail, the low dimensionality and the control of the chemistructural environment could offer the potentiality to obtain high stable material without blue-shift of the material bandgap. Chemi-structural mechanisms involving, strain, surface energy and/or chemical bonds need to be carefully controlled in order to revert the natural tendency of these materials to crystallize in the yellow phase at room temperature. It has been in fact reported that by the control of these mechanisms the stability of black phase can be improved, showing how the approaches discussed in this perspective are an effective solution for phase stabilization. From the experimental results reported employing different stabilization methods of the perovskite black phase, longer stabilization has been reported for FAPbI3 than for CsPbI3. Dedicated research will surely allow in the next years important progresses in the field, focusing on the stabilization of these significant materials with the corresponding implications in the development of photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.</p>
