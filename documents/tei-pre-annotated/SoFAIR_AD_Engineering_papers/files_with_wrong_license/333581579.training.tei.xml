        <p>We developed photo-sensitive polymers that allow in vitro and in vivo fabrication of hydrogels into pre-existing structures, by bio-orthogonal two-photon cycloaddition and crosslinking at wavelengths longer than 850 nm, without byproducts. By this technique, that we name intravital 3D bioprinting, after injection of these polymers in vivo it is possible to fabricate complex 3D structures inside tissues of living mice, including the dermis across epidermis, the skeletal muscle across epimysium or the brain across meninges. The use of commonly available multi-photon microscopes allows accurate (XYZ) positioning and orientation of bioprinted structures into specific anatomical sites. Finally, we show that intravital 3D bioprinting of donor muscle-derived stem cells allows de novo formation of myofibers in host animals. We envision that this strategy will offer an alternative in vivo approach to conventional bioprinting technology, holding great promises to substantially change the paradigm of 3D bioprinting for pre-clinical and clinical use.We developed photo-sensitive polymers that allow in vitro and in vivo fabrication of hydrogels into pre-existing structures, by bio-orthogonal two-photon cycloaddition and crosslinking at wavelengths longer than 850 nm, without byproducts.

        <p>3D printing is an additive process in which successive layers of materials are structured to generate 3D shapes. Such technology is being applied to enable rapid prototyping and manufacturing in industry, as well as production of personalized consumer products 1,2 . Advanced systems have recently implemented layer-by-layer precise positioning of biomaterials, mainly hydrogels, as well as biochemicals and living cells into complex 3D functional tissues, thus progressing from 3D printing to 3D bioprinting [3][4][5][6] .3D printing is an additive process in which successive layers of materials are structured to generate 3D shapes.

        <p>3D bioprinting aims at replicating the composition, mechanical properties and 3D architecture of biological tissues/organs for a large spectrum of biomedical applications. These include the generation of complex in vitro 3D models for drug discovery or biological studies, and the development of implantable functional living human constructs (biomaterials combined with cells) suitable for the restoration of tissue/organ function [3][4][5][6] . As for their clinical application, 3D living constructs are either incubated in vitro for maturation before implantation, or 3D bioprinted and then implanted in vivo [3][4][5][6][7][8] through surgical procedures. Recently reported in situ 3D bioprinting has been limited to damaged areas of external and accessible loci such as skin 9,10 or sites previously exposed by surgical procedure, such as bone 11 and cartilage 12 . The conventional bioprinting approaches require direct access to printing sites and free XYZ spatial movements of the bioprinting head, precluding the internal modifications of pre-existing 3D structures, without affecting the integrity of the structures of interest. On the other hand, injectable materials used as delivery vehicles hold great promise to improve the therapeutic efficacy for functional recovery of diseased or injured tissues and organs, including stem cell-based therapies 13 . An injectable hydrogel is the preferred material form for stem cell transplantation due to its potential to mimic the native stem cell microenvironment [14][15][16] . A variety of crosslinking strategies have been developed to form hydrogel structures in internal regions of tissues: i) physical crosslinking, which include ionic crosslinking and stimuli-responsive crosslinking (such as temperature and pH change); ii) chemical crosslinking, which includes enzymatic, radical or click chemistry, and provides better control of the hydrogel mechanical strength and degradation, compared to physical crosslinking processes 13 . However, independently from the crosslinking strategy used, injectable hydrogels form an isotropic structure around the site of the injection which cannot be controlled in terms of 3D shape and spatial organization.3D bioprinting aims at replicating the composition, mechanical properties and 3D architecture of biological tissues/organs for a large spectrum of biomedical applications.

        <p>In this work, we envision the possibility to inject photo-active polymers in living animals and to directly fabricate in situ spatially-controlled 3D constructs across and within tissues.

        <p>Compared to conventional 3D bioprinting, i3D bioprinting should confront and surpass additional hurdles, which are intrinsic to in vivo application. These include i) fabrication across tissues without inducing tissue damage or interfering with the pre-existing 3D tissue anatomical structures; ii) fabrication efficiency should not be affected by physiological tissue displacements given by heart beating as well as breathing of the live animals; iii) accurate (XYZ) positioning and orientation of 3D bioprinted structures within tissues at site of interest to support cell function and/or tissue regeneration. Ideally, 3D bioprinting in a live animal would also require accurate preprocessing imaging for fine 3D mapping the anatomical area in which the printed object needs to Deleted: minimally invasive Deleted: (minimal invasiveness) be manufactured, and post-processing analysis to effectively evaluate the positioning, the orientation and the accuracy of the printed object.Compared to conventional 3D bioprinting, i3D bioprinting should confront and surpass additional hurdles, which are intrinsic to in vivo application.

        <p>We challenged these hurdles by developing photosensitive biopolymers that can be used to fabricate hydrogels within and across solid matrices or tissues. These biopolymers can be crosslinked in vitro in presence of living cells or inside a pre-mixed gels for controlling organoid shape and behavior in a 3D culture. Moreover, after a simple injection inside the desired anatomical site (i.e. within tissues), photosensitive biopolymers can be photo-crosslinked in vivo to form a 3D object by using near-infrared (IR) laser light associated with high-spatial resolution intravital multi-photon microscopy specifically designed for 3D object fabrication (Fig. 1, named i3D bioprinting). This was accomplished by modifying biocompatible hydrophilic polymeric backbones with a hydrophobic photo-active crosslinking group, which efficiently undergoes cycloaddition when two-photon (2P) excited at wavelengths longer than 850 nm. In virtue of the selected wavelength range, femtosecond IR tightly-focused pulsed laser light can penetrate through soft tissues 17 , allowing 3D hydrogel photo-crosslinking inside tissues and across tissues. We showed that complex 3D hydrogels of branched polyethylene glycol (PEG) and gelatin (Gel) are accurately fabricated into tissues of living mice such as dermis across epidermis, skeletal muscle across epimysium or brain across meninges. The 3D hydrogels show high biocompatibility and incorporation of functional vascular network, which makes the i3D bioprinting a procedure suitable for clinical translation. Finally, we show that i3D bioprinting allows spatially-controlled donor cell grafting and, importantly, supports the generation of newly formed myofiber bundles integrated with host functional vascular network.We challenged these hurdles by developing photosensitive biopolymers that can be used to fabricate hydrogels within and across solid matrices or tissues.

        <p>We initially developed a technology to enable photo-crosslinking of biopolymers into hydrogels by using laser wavelengths that allow deep tissue penetration 17 (λ &gt; 800 nm). Accordingly, we selected coumarin derivatives as photo-sensitive crosslinking moieties for the end functionalization of polymeric backbones. Coumarin derivatives have the potential to undergo [2+2] cycloaddition when exposed to single photon UV-Vis light [18][19][20] or under 2P excitation at near-IR light 18,21,22 . UV-Vis light photo-crosslinking can be performed to fabricate hydrogels in which coumarin derivatives have been used as photo-sensitive crosslinking moieties [23][24][25][26] . However, UV-Vis wavelengths are incompatible with tissue penetration 17 . Few applications reported the use of coumarin-derivatives for 2P hydrogel degradation 25,26 , but not for 2P hydrogel fabrication. On the other hand, coumarin-derivatives were initially developed as fluorescent dyes, so that in vivo imaging of 3D coumarin-based hydrogel structures and their accurate positioning and orientation within living animals will be facilitated. Finally, coumarin-mediated cycloaddition offer the additional advantage of avoiding possible toxicity for living tissues, based on their radical-and photo-initiator-free chemistry 27 . We considered 58 known coumarin derivatives (Suppl. Tab. S1), and 8 of them were selected for further characterization based on ring substituents that can impact their light-absorption properties and the chemistry for backbone conjugation (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Suppl. Tab. S2). Among them, 7-hydroxycoumarin-3-carboxylic acid (HCCA) was defined as an optimal candidate for i3D bioprinting application because it has an electron-donating substituent in the 7-position and an electron-withdrawing substituent in the 3-position, which promote a red-shift of the maximum absorption peak thus offering an advantage in term of tissue permeability to laser light (Extended Data Fig. 1,2). Moreover, the presence of a carboxylic group allows the conjugation of HCCA to polymers, such as linear PEG, branched PEG, and gelatin (Gel) (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3,4) which are among the most common and better characterized polymers used to fabricate biocompatible hydrogels [3][4][5] . HCC-PEG conjugates were characterized by 1 H-NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis, and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) demonstrated HCC-Gel conjugation (Extended Data Fig. 567). The conjugation degree was also quantified, and absorbance spectra were analyzed for all the HCC-polymers (Extended Data Fig. 8).We initially developed a technology to enable photo-crosslinking of biopolymers into hydrogels by using laser wavelengths that allow deep tissue penetration 17 (λ &gt; 800 nm).

        <p>To test light-mediated cycloaddition of HCC-polymers, we initially used HCC-conjugated linear PEG (HCC-PEG) as model. Single-photon excitation (λ = 365 nm) was able to induce HCC-PEG intermolecular cycloaddition in solution, resulting in dimerization of HCC-PEG as showed by spectrophotometric analysis (Fig. 2c). The ability of HCCA to undergo cycloaddition was further confirmed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of HCCA solution (Extended Data Fig. 9,10). Moreover, HCC underwent cycloaddition after 2P excitation at a wavelength of 850 nm using a multi-photon laser-scanning microscope, as showed by the rapid 2D HCC-PEG patterning (~10 sec per 850 µm 2 ) onto HCCA-functionalized glass slides with high spatial precision (Fig. 2d).To test light-mediated cycloaddition of HCC-polymers, we initially used HCC-conjugated linear PEG (HCC-PEG) as model.

        <p>We then tested the possibility of assembling 3D hydrogel constructs by using branched PEG and Gel polymers conjugated to HCCA and excited in a wide wavelength window. In order to screen for wavelengths (700 nm &lt; λ &lt; 1000 nm) that allow 2P crosslinking at mild laser power (0.7 mW), we found that hydrogels made of HCC-4arm PEG, HCC-8arm PEG and HCC-Gel remain in shape after removal of the solution containing non-crosslinked polymers when fabricated at 700 nm &lt; λ &lt; 850 nm (Extended Data Fig. 11). By increasing laser power up to 2 mW, HCC-8arm PEG and HCC-Gel can be crosslinked up to 900 nm (data not shown). Crosslinking is triggered only within the focal region (voxel) and the laser-scanning path of the multi-photon microscope provides spatial control of the reaction. Typically, Z-stacks of regions of interest were 2P excited. Based on the optical properties of the objective used, a Z-spacing of 1 µm between adjacent planes was used. Thus, 3D structures with complex morphology could be easily fabricated by sequential addition of Z-stacks of multiple regions of interest (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 12), including a readable barcode (Extended Data Fig. 12c), words (Extended Data Fig. 12c-d and Suppl. Video S1) or a hollow cube (Extended Data Fig. 12e and Suppl. Video S2). Figure 2e shows parallelepipeds that are 45° rotated on the same Z plane to form an asterisk.We then tested the possibility of assembling 3D hydrogel constructs by using branched PEG and Gel polymers conjugated to HCCA and excited in a wide wavelength window.

        <p>Accuracy of 3D photo-crosslinking was further confirmed after fabrication of hydrogels by photo-crosslinking multiple Z positions, (Fig. 3a) or by assembling additively multiple parallel linear objects. The minimal linewidth (1.9±0.2 µm) of fabricated linear objects (Fig. 3b) and the sub-micrometric resolution of the bioprinting (Fig. 3c) was achieved. Accordingly, a 3D single line flower-shaped hydrogel of HCC-Gel was fabricated using a computer drawing pad combined to a free line scan program of the multi-photon microscope (Fig. 3d and Suppl. Video S3). Additionally, we tested the maximum 3D object dimension (DZ ~2 mm) that was possible to fabricate without changing printing parameters (scanning speed and laser power; Fig. 3e and Suppl. Video S4). Considering the final in vivo application and taking in account the displacement due to animal respiratory movements and pulsed blood flow, we quantified an optimal writing time per single line (ms/line), which allows 3D hydrogel production with structural integrity (Fig. 3f). The optimal writing time of 1 ms/line was therefore used for the i3D bioprinting experiments; lower levels of Formatted: Font: Not Bold laser powers does not trigger 2P-crosslinking, whereas higher powers may induce heat damage. This efficient and fast bioprinting, able to preserve minimum feature dimension, is likely due to the threshold behavior and nonlinear nature of multi-photon excitation 17 combined with highly efficient cycloaddition. In conventional 2P polymerized hydrogels, a photo-initiator and possible co-initiator or sensitizer molecules activate a free radical chemical crosslinking reaction through a diffusion-reaction mechanism 28,29 . In the case of coumarin-conjugated dipeptides (7-(diethylamino)-3-coumarin carboxylic acid), it was previously reported that cycloaddition is facilitated when coumarin moieties are in close proximity 23,24 . Others showed that coumarin-based polymers generate micelles in aqueous solution 18 . In line with this, we observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging that HCC-PEG forms nano-assemblies (Extended Data Fig. 13), supporting the idea that HCC-polymer in aqueous solution can self-assemble into supramolecular structures, in which the HCC photo-active groups are brought in close proximity and are ready to undergo fast cycloaddition upon light excitation, resulting in efficient crosslinking reactions within a focused 2P optical voxel. Over the last decade several reports have highlighted the paramount role of stiffness in regulation of cell behavior 30,31 . Atomic force microscopy has been used to estimate the hydrogel elastic properties 32 , which are strictly correlated with the hydrogel photo-crosslinking rate 33 . Interestingly, we were able to finely tune the stiffness of HCC-4arm PEG or HCC-Gel hydrogels over biological-matched ranges (1 kPa -20 kPa) by modulating the laser power (Fig. 3g). Indeed, multi-photon microscopes allow fine tuning of laser power 34 , which in turn can modulate hydrogel photo-crosslinking rate 33 , the crosslinking density and, consequently, the hydrogel mechanical properties 32 . To better characterize hydrogel photo-crosslinking rate on multiple samples and larger volume in conventional fabrication conditions, 7-Carboxymethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (CMMC)-4arm PEG and CMMC-Gel were specifically designed and produced to perform 1-photon UV mediated cycloaddition (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 14,15). The elastic modulus increases to asymptotic values by increasing the irradiation time, showing a sigmoidal temporal profile of elastic modulus that reached the polymer crosslinking saturation, independently from the polymeric backbone used (Fig. 3h). Interestingly, the modulation of elastic modulus of hydrogels obtained with 1P and 2P photo-crosslinking (with CMMC-Gel and HCC-gel, respectively) by varying the polymer concentration showed remarkable similarity (Fig. 3i). Altogether these results demonstrated the ability to fabricate 3D hydrogels with precise XYZ positioning, micrometric resolution and tunable physiological stiffness by using IR light-mediated photo-crosslinking of HCC-polymeric solutions.Accuracy of 3D photo-crosslinking was further confirmed after fabrication of hydrogels by photo-crosslinking multiple Z positions, (Fig. 3a) or by assembling additively multiple parallel linear objects.

        <p>Given that hydrogels need to be fully biocompatible, we firstly assessed the ability of HCC-Gel to support in vitro culture of different cell types. Pre-assembled flat HCC-Gel hydrogels (ΔZ = 30 µm) supported adhesion and culture of HUVEC cells (Extended Data Fig. 16a) and human embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem cells (hES-derived NSCs; Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 16b-d). Three days after seeding, hES-derived NSCs showed expression of specific neural markers and absence of apoptosis when cultured on pre-assembled flat HCC-Gel hydrogels (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 16e). Fibroblasts (FBs) derived from green fluorescent protein (GFP)expressing mice efficiently adhere to parallelepiped-shaped HCC-Gel hydrogels characterized by different size (ΔZ up to 150 µm) and interspace (down to 10 µm) and change their morphology according to the 3D shape of fabricated hydrogels (Extended Data Fig. 17). We further confirmed the biocompatibility of HCC-Gel solution and of the photo-crosslinking strategy by using cell-laden HCC-Gel solution. Six hours after hydrogel crosslinking, FBs were viable and embedded within 3D hydrogel structures (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 18 and Suppl. Video S5). Interestingly, the elastic modulus of bioprinted structures was not strongly changed by the presence of cells (Young's modulus was reduced by about 6% in presence of cells, Fig. 4c), suggesting that the 2P-crosslinking and hydrogel fabrication were not substantially affected by cells suspended in the HCC-Gel solution. Then, we evaluated cell viability comparing cell-laden constructs obtained with conventional single photon hydrogel crosslinking (λ = 365 nm, single photon, CMMC-Gel) 28,29 , those fabricated with 2P bioprinting (λ = 850 nm, 2-photon, HCC-Gel), compared to irradiated-only (λ = 365 nm, Matrigel) or unirradiated (Matrigel) controls. Two days after 3D culture, cell viability was between 90-99% in all conditions (Fig. 4d). We noticed that with our set-up single photon irradiation time up to 3 minutes and 2P bioprinting laser power up to 1 mW give good cell viability (as used in Fig. 4d), whereas increasing laser power was detrimental for viability (data not shown).Given that hydrogels need to be fully biocompatible, we firstly assessed the ability of HCC-Gel to support in vitro culture of different cell types. Pre-assembled flat HCC-Gel hydrogels (ΔZ = 30 µm) supported adhesion and culture of HUVEC cells (Extended Data Fig. 16a) and human embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem cells (hES-derived NSCs; Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 16b-d). Three days after seeding, hES-derived NSCs showed expression of specific neural markers and absence of apoptosis when cultured on pre-assembled flat HCC-Gel hydrogels (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 16e). Fibroblasts (FBs) derived from green fluorescent protein (GFP)expressing mice efficiently adhere to parallelepiped-shaped HCC-Gel hydrogels characterized by different size (ΔZ up to 150 µm) and interspace (down to 10 µm) and change their morphology according to the 3D shape of fabricated hydrogels (Extended Data Fig. 17). We further confirmed the biocompatibility of HCC-Gel solution and of the photo-crosslinking strategy by using cell-laden HCC-Gel solution. Six hours after hydrogel crosslinking, FBs were viable and embedded within 3D hydrogel structures (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 18 and Suppl. Video S5). Interestingly, the elastic modulus of bioprinted structures was not strongly changed by the presence of cells (Young's modulus was reduced by about 6% in presence of cells, Fig. 4c), suggesting that the 2P-crosslinking and hydrogel fabrication were not substantially affected by cells suspended in the HCC-Gel solution. Then, we evaluated cell viability comparing cell-laden constructs obtained with conventional single photon hydrogel crosslinking (λ = 365 nm, single photon, CMMC-Gel) 28,29 , those fabricated with 2P bioprinting (λ = 850 nm, 2-photon, HCC-Gel), compared to irradiated-only (λ = 365 nm, Matrigel) or unirradiated (Matrigel) controls. Two days after 3D culture, cell viability was between 90-99% in all conditions (Fig. 4d).

        <p>Starting from these results, we then asked whether the shape of 3D bioprinted cell-laden HCC-Gel could provide specific topological cues. To investigate this, we used the ability of murine musclederived stem cells (MuSC) to differentiate into myotubes and to adapt their morphology and orientation based on microenvironment topology 35,36 . As confirmed by quantification of cell directionality, single-nucleated or polynucleated cells within elongated-shaped HCC-Gel structures appeared oriented along major axis of the 3D structures (Fig. 4e, left panel; Fig. 4f), whereas cells located in cuboid-shaped HCC-Gel structures were randomly oriented (Fig. 4e, right panel; Fig. 4f). Finally, to evaluate whether HCC-Gel hydrogels were able to support cell culture for longer time and cell functionality, MuSCs were cultured on parallelepiped-shaped HCC-Gel structures for 10 days. Microscopic analysis demonstrated that parallelepiped-shaped HCC-Gel hydrogels support the formation of aligned multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 4g) that showed spontaneous contraction 5 days after induction of cell differentiation (Suppl. Video S6). These data demonstrated that the photo-crosslinking of HCC-Gel does not affect cell viability, is compatible with cell-laden 3D bioprinting, and supports stem cell differentiation and cellular function. It is worth underlining that our setup can be also employed synergistically to conventional 3D bioprinting strategies 5 .Starting from these results, we then asked whether the shape of 3D bioprinted cell-laden HCC-Gel could provide specific topological cues.

        <p>In vitro bioprinting into pre-existing human organoid 3D culture. i3D bioprinting entails additional complexities: 3D bioprinting needs to be performed into anatomical sites of living animals, such as tissues, body cavities or extracellular matrix that may include a variety of components of the interstitial space. Thus, we then tested the possibility of fabricating 3D hydrogel objects into a pre-existing 3D matrix. For this purpose, we used Matrigel, a gel formed by a basement membrane equivalent widely used for 3D cultures of cells and organoids. 50/50 HCC-Gel/Matrigel mixture (v/v) was used to crosslink HCC-Gel 3D structures of defined XYZ position and orientation within the gel. HCC-Gel 2P photo-crosslinking showed a bio-orthogonal reaction in pre-existing gel (Fig. 5a, and Suppl. Video S7). When fabricated into pre-existing 3D Matrigel, hydrogel structures remained in shape also after Matrigel dissociation and, interestingly, showed comparable elastic modulus of hydrogel fabricated in absence of Matrigel (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, HCC-Gel/Matrigel 3D gels were able to support the viability and the growth of human small intestinal organoids (hSIOs, Extended Data Fig. 19), which is a challenging in vitro 3D human culture 37 , while preserving the possibility of fabricating crosslinked objects within the gel. With this in mind, we fabricated 3D parallelepipeds accurately positioned and oriented relative to selected hSIOs within the 3D gel culture (Fig. 5c, Extended data Fig. 20 and Suppl. Video S8). Further analysis of such culture can also be performed, as shown by the intestinal epithelial marker, Ezrin, and f-actin staining (Extended data Fig. 20b). HCC-Gel hydrogel cytocompatibility on hSIOs enclosed in the structures was demonstrated by live/dead assay performed after 2 days and 8 days of culture (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 21a).In vitro bioprinting into pre-existing human organoid 3D culture. i3D bioprinting entails additional complexities: 3D bioprinting needs to be performed into anatomical sites of living animals, such as tissues, body cavities or extracellular matrix that may include a variety of components of the interstitial space.

        <p>Then, we investigated whether bioprinted HCC-Gel walls within Matrigel and specifically positioned around individual hSIOs could affect their biological behavior (Fig. 5c). hSIOs confined inside an open square-box (formed by 4 orthogonal walls) grew normally and after few days of culture touched and deformed HCC-Gel hydrogel walls (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 21b). Between day 6 and day 8 of culture, hSIOs enclosed in HCC-Gel-based hydrogel showed marked morphology changes, which lead to well-developed columnar epithelium (Fig. 5f). This morphology was characterized by thickening of the organoid wall, F-actin localization in apical position and nuclei constriction in the basal domain as quantified by the basal-apical distance ratio and the basal/apical axis (Fig. 5g-i). In comparison, hSIOs cultured in the same hydrogel composition but without any contact with HCC-Gel structures did not show such morphological changes (Fig. 5f). Interestingly, the basal localization of beta4-integrin observed in hSIOs enclosed in HCC-Gel structures (Fig. 5i) suggests that cell adhesion could be one possible mechanism involved in the observed phenotype. To dissect the contributions of extrinsic mechanical vs biochemical signals in triggering the organoid morphological changes, hSIOs cultured in Matrigel were enclosed inside an open square-box made of HCC-8arm PEG-based hydrogel, which is well-known to display cell repellent properties 8,38,39 . We prove that HCC-8arm PEG/Matrigel allowed hSIO survival and growth in culture (Fig. 5j). However, differently from what observed with HCC-Gel, hSIOs enclosed in HCC-8arm PEG-based hydrogel did not show columnar epithelium after 8 days of culture, hydrogel deformation, actin apical localization nor nuclei constriction (Fig. 5k,l). Instead, hSIOs morphology reflects the 3D shape of the enclosed open-box made by HCC-8arm PEG-based hydrogel. As confirmed by Feret's angle quantification, only hSIOs enclosed by HCC-8arm PEG acquired a cuboidal cystic structure 6 days after culture, when compared to HCC-Gel enclosed hSIOs (Fig. 5m). It has been shown that mechanical properties of synthetic hydrogel have a role in expansion and differentiation of murine SIOs 40 , whereas the effect of hydrogel stiffness on hSIO behavior remains unclear. Our results suggest that the formation of columnar epithelium of hSIO could be correlated to the hydrogel biochemical composition rather than its pure mechanical properties, since HCC-Gel and HCC-PEG were fabricated for having the same Young's modulus. It would be of future interest to use this approach to investigate the cues that give rise to columnar epithelium in hSIOs.Then, we investigated whether bioprinted HCC-Gel walls within Matrigel and specifically positioned around individual hSIOs could affect their biological behavior (Fig. 5c). hSIOs confined inside an open square-box (formed by 4 orthogonal walls) grew normally and after few days of culture touched and deformed HCC-Gel hydrogel walls (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 21b).

        <p>In vivo hydrogel bioprinting. Our next goal was to test whether i3D printing is possible across tissues and inside tissues. Skin was identified as an optimal target organ to perform i3D printing without open surgery. The HCCpolymer solution was locally delivered in vivo by intra-dermal injection in wild-type or GFP + transgenic mice. Then, the HCC-polymer solution was exposed to focalized pulsed near-IR laser light (λ = 850 nm) using a 2P microscope (Fig. 6a). Either wild-type or GFP + transgenic mice were anesthetized and subjected to i3D bioprinting in the skin. With this setup, we succeeded in efficiently fabricating isolated 3D objects inside the dermis of living animals (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 22a). In GFP + mice, by taking advantage of fluorescence imaging of host tissues, we could easily visualize both the manufactured objects located inside dermis, and the integrity of the epidermis above the crosslinked hydrogel (Fig. 6b and Suppl. Video S9). The exact localization could be revealed by the hair bulb position (Fig. 6b, arrow). The high compatibility of i3D bioprinting was further confirmed by the integrity of the skin after the entire procedure, which was comparable to untreated tissue (Fig. 6b,c). Furthermore, as demonstrated in vitro, we showed that i3D bioprinting across epidermis allows the manufacture of 3D hydrogel structures with micrometric linewidth (Extended Data Fig. 22b), and the fabrication of inserts with a variety of morphologies thanks to the precise XYZ positioning (Extended Data Fig. 22a).In vivo hydrogel bioprinting.

        <p>Once demonstrated that i3D printing can be performed across epidermis without open surgery, we tested if such technology was applicable to other tissues. Thus, a minimal surgical procedure was applied to expose intact skeletal muscle or brain and HCC-polymer solutions were injected below the epimysium or meninges, respectively, and above the tissues of interest. Photosensitive solutions injected under the epimysium of skeletal muscle were photo-crosslinked to fabricate 3D hydrogels at the surface of muscle fibers without evident alteration of the overall muscle fiber morphology and connective tissue integrity (Fig. 6d,e, Extended Data Fig. 23 and Suppl. Video S10,S11). 2P-crosslinked hydrogels were formed only in the area where the reaction was performed (Fig. 6f). Our experimental setup allows real-time imaging during and after i3D bioprinting, giving the possibility of triggering hydrogel crosslinking in a specific anatomical site, i.e. a single myofibre versus a bundle of myofibers. Given the natural anatomic patterning of myofibres, skeletal muscle was also used to verify the ability to fabricate i3D bioprinted hydrogels by precisely tuning their XYZ position and orientation. Multiple objects were fabricated in a parallel or orthogonal fashion when compared to their position and/or to myofiber orientation (Extended Data Fig. 24). The versatility of the fabrication protocol was further proved by performing i3D bioprinting of a HCC-Gel hydrogel displaying infinite-symbol shape, using the design realized with a computer drawing pad as input for the free line scan program of the multiphoton microscope (Extended Data Fig. 25). Safe i3D bioprinting was also possible in a particularly vulnerable tissue such as brain. Burr hole was performed into the skull of mice to allow HCC-polymeric solution injection across meninges, and subsequent hydrogel crosslinking was achieved by using 2P excitation through multi-photon microscope (Fig. 6g). Importantly, we found absence of bleeding foci and a correct maintenance of blood flow at the area of i3D bioprinting in the brain (Fig 6g and Extended Data Fig. 26a). 2P crosslinked hydrogels surrounded and embedded the host vasculature network without damaging the vessels and preserved blood flow, as shown by red-dextran tracing (Fig. 6h and Extended Data Fig. 26b). These results further confirmed the biocompatibility of i3D bioprinting. In vivo biocompatibility. To reach the above results and effectively translate 3D hydrogel fabrication in vivo, we optimized laser power and writing time across tissues balancing crosslinking efficiency, velocity of 3D bioprinting (to reduce the effect of movements associated to breathing and cardiac beating), and heat-induced tissue damage. The optimal writing time (1 ms/line) was combined with the optimal laser power (1 mW) to obtain a stable hydrogel under epimysium without myofiber damage, as the Formatted: Font: Not Bold Formatted: Font: Not Bold Formatted: Font: Not Bold appearance of heat-induced damage, myofiber contraction and cleavage of cell death-marker caspase-8 41,42 were absent (Extended Data Fig. 27). Myofiber damage was observed only after 2P irradiation with 3-fold increased laser power and ~17-fold increased time of irradiation per single confocal plane, when compared to i3D bioprinting condition (Extended Data Fig. 27). Therefore, we investigated the biocompatibility of HCC-4arm PEG and HCC-Gel solution. HCC-4arm PEG crosslinked hydrogels were found to be preserved in vivo 4 days after i3D printing across epimysium, with no evident tissue damage at the site of 2P-crosslinking as shown by imaging analysis (Extended Data Fig. 28a,b). Consistent with PEG biocompatibility studies 43 , immunofluorescence analysis showed recruitment of macrophages to the site of hydrogel crosslinking, despite the fact no evident histological changes were observed (Extended Data Fig. 28c,d). Since PEG hydrogels are cell repellent 8,38,39 , and based on previous in vitro results, we further investigated in vivo biocompatibility of our injectable HCC-Gel hydrogels before challenging longer term i3D printing in the presence of donor cells (i3D bioprinting). In order to prove biocompatibility of HCC-Gel, the polymeric solution was subcutaneously injected into wild type mice and histological (Haematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichromic) staining, TUNEL test, and immunofluorescence staining for macrophages were performed after 4, 7 and 21 days. When compared to animals treated with PBS, no evident histological modification, cell apoptosis or macrophage infiltration were observed (Extended Data Fig. 29).Once demonstrated that i3D printing can be performed across epidermis without open surgery, we tested if such technology was applicable to other tissues.

        <p>Lastly, we aimed at showing that i3D bioprinting could be effectively employed in live animals for i) delivering cells in a spatially controlled manner; ii) allowing precise cell grafting into a defined anatomical site; and iii) supporting a proper structural organization of de novo tissues.Lastly, we aimed at showing that i3D bioprinting could be effectively employed in live animals for i) delivering cells in a spatially controlled manner; ii) allowing precise cell grafting into a defined anatomical site; and iii) supporting a proper structural organization of de novo tissues.</p>
        <p>We then investigated if i3D bioprinting could instruct spatial control of cell engraftment by firstly employing HCC-Gel laden with primary mCherry + FBs, delivered across the epimysium of murine hind limb of isogeneic immunocompetent animals. Distinct freshly fabricated HCC-Gel structures containing embedded mCherry + FBs were located between the epimysium and skeletal muscle of host wild-type mice accordingly with the bioprinted structures (Extended Data Fig. 30a). Then, longer term studies were performed for investigating the effect of cell-laden i3D bioprinting on donor cells. The mCherry + FBs suspended into HCC-Gel solution were injected under the epimysium (no i3D bioprinting) or injected and subjected to i3D bioprinting for the generation of parallelepiped-shaped constructs. Donor mCherry + FBs were identified in host animals 21 days after delivery in both experimental conditions (Extended Data Fig. 30b-h). However, imaging analysis showed elongated clusters of mCherry + FBs only in i3D bioprinted animals, which followed the posteroanterior axis of the parallelepiped-shaped constructs defined during i3D bioprinting (Extended Data Fig. 30b-e). Conversely, injected cells that did not undergo i3D bioprinting were organized into rounded clusters (Extended Data Fig. 30b,f-h). To extend these results to another tissue, i3D bioprinting was also performed across the epidermis. Elongated localization of mCherry + FBs was observed 14 days after intra-dermal injection and i3D bioprinting of embedded donor cells into parallelepiped-shaped constructs, when compared to mCherry + FBs injected only, that conversely remained localized into rounded clusters (Extended Data Fig. 30i). These data strongly suggested that i3D bioprinting can elicit a desired spatial organization of delivered cells. Intravital bioprinting for de novo tissue formation. Finally, we aimed at demonstrating that i3D bioprinting has the potential to support de novo tissue formation. As a tissue model, we used skeletal muscle since its formation requires anisotropic cell alignment during the early stages of skeletal muscle regeneration [44][45][46] . Numerous stem cells have been shown to possess myogenic potential and thus have been applied for cell therapy-based regenerative medicine approaches aimed at promoting skeletal muscle regeneration 45 . In particular, MuSCs can give rise to a large number of progeny able to contribute extensively to the formation of new muscle fibers when transplanted in vivo [44][45][46] . Moreover, MuSCs show the ability to regenerate skeletal muscle when in situ embedded into a photocrosslinked hydrogel to repair a volumetric muscle loss damage 47 . However, the proper differentiation of MuSCs and maturation of myotubes into aligned myofibers follow restricted 3D spatially defined patterns 35,36 . Since FBs have been shown to support and sustain skeletal muscle regeneration [48][49][50] , we designed an experimental strategy in which HCC-Gel solution laden with both FBs and MuSCs was employed for testing whether i3D bioprinting of parallelepipeds could promote de novo skeletal muscle formation. A defined ratio 51 of GFP + MuSCs to mCherry + in HCC-Gel solution were injected and then i3D bioprinted into multiple parallelepiped-shaped constructs (Fig. 7a). As controls, animals were also injected with cells resuspended in PBS, in Matrigel or HCC-Gel solution without 2P irradiation (Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 31a-c). One week after treatments, confined bundle of elongated GFP + cells was observed only in animals that underwent i3D bioprinting (Fig. 7a,b). Conversely, after injection without i3D bioprinting, sparse cells were found in the host tissue (Fig. 7b and Extended Data Fig. 31a-c). In agreement with previous results, quantification of cell directionality showed that i3D bioprinting allows the generation of a spatially controlled cell engraftment (Fig. 7c). Remarkably, the bundle of elongated GFP + cells were integrated by the host tissue, with a functional three-dimensionally organized vascular network observed only in i3D bioprinted animals (Fig. 7b). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that de novo formed tissue is constitute of regenerating myofibers as confirmed by the expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain protein (eMHC), which is a marker of newly formed myofibers (Fig. 7d). Striated organization of the muscular cytoskeleton, as well as presence of branched and centrally nucleated myofibers were also observed (Fig. 7e) and mCherry + FBs were founded at the periphery of GFP + myofibers derived from donor GFP + MuSCs (Extended Data Fig. 31d). Immunostaing for GFP, laminin and nuclei was used to quantify centrally nucleated myofibers. The analysis revealed that donor myofibers are mostly centrally nucleated, conversely host myofibers do not show centrally located nuclei, indicating that muscle regeneration is restricted to donor-derived tissue (Fig. 7f). Altogether, these results indicate that i3D bioprinting supports de novo skeletal muscle tissue formation, which was characterized by proper structural organization and integration with the host vascular system.We then investigated if i3D bioprinting could instruct spatial control of cell engraftment by firstly employing HCC-Gel laden with primary mCherry + FBs, delivered across the epimysium of murine hind limb of isogeneic immunocompetent animals. Distinct freshly fabricated HCC-Gel structures containing embedded mCherry + FBs were located between the epimysium and skeletal muscle of host wild-type mice accordingly with the bioprinted structures (Extended Data Fig. 30a). Then, longer term studies were performed for investigating the effect of cell-laden i3D bioprinting on donor cells. The mCherry + FBs suspended into HCC-Gel solution were injected under the epimysium (no i3D bioprinting) or injected and subjected to i3D bioprinting for the generation of parallelepiped-shaped constructs. Donor mCherry + FBs were identified in host animals 21 days after delivery in both experimental conditions (Extended Data Fig. 30b-h). However, imaging analysis showed elongated clusters of mCherry + FBs only in i3D bioprinted animals, which followed the posteroanterior axis of the parallelepiped-shaped constructs defined during i3D bioprinting (Extended Data Fig. 30b-e). Conversely, injected cells that did not undergo i3D bioprinting were organized into rounded clusters (Extended Data Fig. 30b,f-h). To extend these results to another tissue, i3D bioprinting was also performed across the epidermis. Elongated localization of mCherry + FBs was observed 14 days after intra-dermal injection and i3D bioprinting of embedded donor cells into parallelepiped-shaped constructs, when compared to mCherry + FBs injected only, that conversely remained localized into rounded clusters (Extended Data Fig. 30i). These data strongly suggested that i3D bioprinting can elicit a desired spatial organization of delivered cells. Intravital bioprinting for de novo tissue formation. Finally, we aimed at demonstrating that i3D bioprinting has the potential to support de novo tissue formation. As a tissue model, we used skeletal muscle since its formation requires anisotropic cell alignment during the early stages of skeletal muscle regeneration [44][45][46] . Numerous stem cells have been shown to possess myogenic potential and thus have been applied for cell therapy-based regenerative medicine approaches aimed at promoting skeletal muscle regeneration 45 . In particular, MuSCs can give rise to a large number of progeny able to contribute extensively to the formation of new muscle fibers when transplanted in vivo [44][45][46] . Moreover, MuSCs show the ability to regenerate skeletal muscle when in situ embedded into a photocrosslinked hydrogel to repair a volumetric muscle loss damage 47 . However, the proper differentiation of MuSCs and maturation of myotubes into aligned myofibers follow restricted 3D spatially defined patterns 35,36 . Since FBs have been shown to support and sustain skeletal muscle regeneration [48][49][50] , we designed an experimental strategy in which HCC-Gel solution laden with both FBs and MuSCs was employed for testing whether i3D bioprinting of parallelepipeds could promote de novo skeletal muscle formation. A defined ratio 51 of GFP + MuSCs to mCherry + in HCC-Gel solution were injected and then i3D bioprinted into multiple parallelepiped-shaped constructs (Fig. 7a). As controls, animals were also injected with cells resuspended in PBS, in Matrigel or HCC-Gel solution without 2P irradiation (Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 31a-c). One week after treatments, confined bundle of elongated GFP + cells was observed only in animals that underwent i3D bioprinting (Fig. 7a,b). Conversely, after injection without i3D bioprinting, sparse cells were found in the host tissue (Fig. 7b and Extended Data Fig. 31a-c). In agreement with previous results, quantification of cell directionality showed that i3D bioprinting allows the generation of a spatially controlled cell engraftment (Fig. 7c). Remarkably, the bundle of elongated GFP + cells were integrated by the host tissue, with a functional three-dimensionally organized vascular network observed only in i3D bioprinted animals (Fig. 7b). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that de novo formed tissue is constitute of regenerating myofibers as confirmed by the expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain protein (eMHC), which is a marker of newly formed myofibers (Fig. 7d). Striated organization of the muscular cytoskeleton, as well as presence of branched and centrally nucleated myofibers were also observed (Fig. 7e) and mCherry + FBs were founded at the periphery of GFP + myofibers derived from donor GFP + MuSCs (Extended Data Fig. 31d). Immunostaing for GFP, laminin and nuclei was used to quantify centrally nucleated myofibers. The analysis revealed that donor myofibers are mostly centrally nucleated, conversely host myofibers do not show centrally located nuclei, indicating that muscle regeneration is restricted to donor-derived tissue (Fig. 7f). Altogether, these results indicate that i3D bioprinting supports de novo skeletal muscle tissue formation, which was characterized by proper structural organization and integration with the host vascular system.</p>
        <p>In summary, we show that i3D bioprinting allows the fabrication of hydrogels that can support the maintenance of cell functionality and can be used to modulate their behavior. With this approach, bioprinting is possible not only in vitro into pre-existing 3D environments (Matrigel), but also across tissues in different target organs in live animals together with real-time imaging. By allowing hydrogel fabrication into pre-existing 3D environments, i3D bioprinting technology represents an innovative strategy that could be used to advance our understanding of in vitro organoid models. Deliberate regulation of self-organization and morphogenesis hold the potential to ameliorate organoid topology and reproducibility, as well as to dissect mechanotransduction and biochemical mechanisms underpinning specific cell responses in 3D culture conditions 52 . Furthermore, i3D bioprinting is envisioned as a mean to perform in vivo 3D confined cell delivery, capable of instructing cell structural organization within tissues. This represents a novel strategy to improve engraftment of cells after injection within tissues, avoiding fast dispersion and the short life-time of cells that typically occurs with this delivery strategy 53 . The i3D technology offers an unprecedented opportunity to study cell biology and physiology in 3D environments, where the internal structure and organization can be modified according to the biological needs both in vitro and in vivo. It is worth to underline that this approach could suffer from limitations related to the multi-photon microscopy, such as the size and depth of hydrogel crosslinking that falls into millimeter scale. Conversely, research in multi-photon microscopy/lithography is rapidly developing novel strategies to overcome such limitations 54 , including deep tissue penetration with 3 photon excitation 55 , optical fiber guidance 56 and multiphoton holographic technology 57,58 . At the current stage i3D bioprinting is limited to tissues that are accessible to the light source. However, we envision that in the future i3D bioprinting can benefit from the above developing strategies and can be coupled with emerging optical imagingguided surgery 59,60 , opening new paradigm in minimally invasive-surgical techniques suitable for organ repair, reconstruction and de novo fabrication.In summary, we show that i3D bioprinting allows the fabrication of hydrogels that can support the maintenance of cell functionality and can be used to modulate their behavior.

Left panel, immunofluorescence performed for GFP (green) and laminin (gray) in wild-type animals 7 days after i3D bioprinting of GFP+MuSC/mCherry+FBladen HCC-Gel. Right panel, immunofluorescence performed for embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC, magenta) and laminin (gray) in wild-type animals 7 days after i3D bioprinting of GFP+MuSC/mCherry + FB-laden HCC-Gel. Dotted line shows the limit between host muscle (above) and de novo tissue (below); scale bars, 400 µm. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue). e, Confocal images of regenerating myofibers stained for eMyHC. Left panel, dotted line shows the limit between host muscle (above) and de novo tissue (below). Arrowheads point at myofiber branching (left), striated organization of the cytoskeleton (middle) and presence of centrally locate nuclei; scale bars, 30 µm (left) and 15 µm (middle, right). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue). f, Left panel, quantification of GFP-negative (GFP-) and GFP-positive (GFP+) myofibers that showed centrally located nuclei (CNF) or peripheral location of the nuclei (no CNF).

        <p>H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 3.38 (s, 3H, CH3O-PEG), 3.64 (bs, ∼180H, -CH2CH2-O-of PEG chain), 6.88-6.90 (m, 2H, Ar-H of HCC), 7.added of 250 µL barium chloride (5% w/v in 1 M HCl) and 250 µL iodine solution (1.27 g of I2 in a 2% KI solution in Milli-Q water). After 15 min, absorbance was measured at 535 nm and referred to a calibration curve of mPEG-NH2 obtained with the same procedure. The conjugation yield (reported as %) of HCC-PEG, HCC-4arm PEG and HCC-8arm PEG was calculated by the [HCCA]/[PEG] molar ratio compared to the maximum theoretical molar ratio ([HCCA]/[PEG] of 1:1 for HCC-PEG, [HCCA]/[PEG] of 4:1 for HCC-4arm PEG and [HCCA]/[PEG] of 8:1 for HCC-8arm PEG). The conjugation yield was estimated to be 92% for HCC-PEG, 95% for HCC-4arm PEG, 90% for HCC-8arm PEG.H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 3.38 (s, 3H, CH3O-PEG), 3.64 (bs, ∼180H, -CH2CH2-O-of PEG chain), 6.88-6.90 (m, 2H, Ar-H of HCC), 7.added of 250 µL barium chloride (5% w/v in 1 M HCl) and 250 µL iodine solution (1.27 g of I2 in a 2% KI solution in Milli-Q water).
