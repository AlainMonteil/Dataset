        <p>Optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide a way to engineer very narrow resonances in photonic crystals. The extended interaction time in these systems is particularly promising for the enhancement of nonlinear optical processes and the development of the next generation of active optical devices. However, the achievable interaction strength is limited by the purely photonic character of optical BICs. Here, we mix the optical BIC in a photonic crystal slab with excitons in the atomically thin semiconductor MoSe 2 to form nonlinear exciton-polaritons with a Rabi splitting of 27 meV, exhibiting large interaction-induced spectral blueshifts. The asymptotic BIC-like suppression of polariton radiation into the far field toward the BIC wavevector, in combination with effective reduction of the excitonic disorder through motional narrowing, results in small polariton linewidths below 3 meV. Together with a strongly wavevector-dependent Q-factor, this provides for the enhancement and control of polariton-polariton interactions and the resulting nonlinear optical effects, paving the way toward tuneable BIC-based polaritonic devices for sensing, lasing, and nonlinear optics.Optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide a way to engineer very narrow resonances in photonic crystals.

        <p>Optical bound states in the continuum (BICs), supported by photonic crystal structures of certain geometries, have received much attention recently as a novel approach to generating extremely spectrally narrow resonant responses 1,2 .

        <p>Here, we experimentally demonstrate and investigate nonlinear polaritons formed via the strong coupling of excitons in monolayer (1 L) MoSe 2 and optical BICs in a 1D PCS, with Rabi splitting of &gt;27 meV and BIC-like radiation suppression in the surface-normal direction. Despite the large ∼9 meV inhomogeneous broadening of the MoSe 2 excitonic line, we achieve a small polariton linewidth below 3 meV, corresponding to a very well resolved splitting-to-linewidth ratio of ∼9 and Q-factors up to 900. Using the strongly wavevector-dependent Q-factor of the photonic crystal dispersion, we show a controllable reduction in the polariton linewidth by a factor of 5-10 when approaching the BIC. The narrow polariton lines allow us to accurately measure the polariton-polariton interaction strength through power-dependent spectral blueshifts in the resonant reflectance experiment, corresponding to an exciton-exciton interaction strength of g X ∼ 1.0 μeV μm 2 . This polariton nonlinearity is comparable with the values measured in III-V materials 24,25 and significantly larger than those previously observed in TMD monolayer-based systems 22 , paving the way toward quantum applications of excitonpolaritons in atomically thin semiconductors.Here, we experimentally demonstrate and investigate nonlinear polaritons formed via the strong coupling of excitons in monolayer (1 L) MoSe 2 and optical BICs in a 1D PCS, with Rabi splitting of &gt;27 meV and BIC-like radiation suppression in the surface-normal direction.

        <p>The extracted Fano fit parameters are plotted in Fig. 1f, g as functions of the ratio k x /k = sinθ, where k x is the inplane wavevector component, k is the free-space wavevector magnitude, and θ is the angle with respect to the surface normal. Toward the Γ point (k x → 0), the reflectivity associated with the mode sharply decreases (f, red), while the spectral line narrows (g, black circles), resulting in a sharply increasing Q-factor (g, red open circles), defined as Q = ω 0 /γ. This behavior is a characteristic of an at-Γ optical BIC 26 , where the interference of optical waves outgoing in opposite directions leads to effective light trapping in the near field and vanishing far-field radiation.

        <p>We then create polaritons by coupling the observed BIC to excitons in the monolayer MoSe 2 in a vertically stacked structure consisting of 1 L MoSe 2 , multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and a PCS, as illustrated in Fig. 2a.

The hBN spacer plays a threefold role: it avoids MoSe 2 flakes "sagging" into the PCS grooves, reduces the influence of the Ta 2 O 5 surface roughness, and provides tunability of the BIC frequency through the hBN thickness. In our case, a 9 nm thick hBN spacer shifts the PCS mode and spectral position of the BIC by ∼30 meV to bring it close to resonance with the neutral exciton in the 1 L MoSe 2 at 7 K, with ħω X = 1.65 eV (Fig. 1f, blue squares).We then create polaritons by coupling the observed BIC to excitons in the monolayer MoSe 2 in a vertically stacked structure consisting of 1 L MoSe 2 , multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and a PCS, as illustrated in Fig. 2a.

        <p>First, at the Γ point, both the LPB and UPB are "dark," as radiation into the far field becomes symmetry forbidden, effectively extending the interaction time for potential enhancement of the optical nonlinearities. Second, close to the Γ point, polaritons possess a negative effective mass and associated negative group velocity inherited from the PCS mode, providing a potential platform for studying TMDbased polariton self-focusing and soliton formation, similar to what has been discussed theoretically and studied experimentally in other polariton systems 14,29 . Third, the strong variation in the PCS mode linewidth in the vicinity of the BIC results in a wavevector-dependent Q-factor of both the LPB and UPB, enabling control of the polariton linewidth with the angle. These strongly modulated Q-factors, when combined with polariton-polariton interactions, can lead to novel phenomena such as the emergence of the socalled "weak lasing" state of matter 30 or the spontaneous formation of superfluid polariton currents 31 .First, at the Γ point, both the LPB and UPB are "dark," as radiation into the far field becomes symmetry forbidden, effectively extending the interaction time for potential enhancement of the optical nonlinearities.

        <p>While it is difficult to directly compare our g X values with those observed in III-V materials due to the few orders of magnitude difference in the reported numbers, our interaction strength is not much lower than the values of g X ≃ 10 μeV μm 2 recently extracted from careful measurements in GaAs-based polaritonic systems 25 . On the other hand, our nonlinearities are considerably larger than those reported previously for WS 2 -based polaritons 22 , where the estimation of the exciton-exciton interaction strength could possibly be uncertain due to efficient local heating at 300 K and the use of high excitation densities leading to higher-order interaction effects and associated redshifts.While it is difficult to directly compare our g X values with those observed in III-V materials due to the few orders of magnitude difference in the reported numbers, our interaction strength is not much lower than the values of g X ≃ 10 μeV μm 2 recently extracted from careful measurements in GaAs-based polaritonic systems 25 .

        <p>The exciton densities in our experiment (≤10 12 cm -2 ) are far below the Mott transition density (~10 14 cm -2 ), and the observed polariton nonlinearity is mostly due to the exciton-exciton interaction, with phase space filling effects likely playing only a minor role. As seen from the fluence-dependent linewidth plots in the bottom panel of Fig. 4c, the increased interaction at higher densities also leads to a faster polariton decay, manifested as powerdependent broadening. In addition, we note that the observed nonlinearities are fast at least on a 100 fs scale, providing future opportunities for developing polaritonbased ultrafast modulators and switches.The exciton densities in our experiment (≤10 12 cm -2 ) are far below the Mott transition density (~10 14 cm -2 ), and the observed polariton nonlinearity is mostly due to the exciton-exciton interaction, with phase space filling effects likely playing only a minor role.

        <p>In summary, we present the first experimental demonstration and investigation of optical BIC-based polaritonic excitations. The formation of BIC-like polaritons in a hybrid system of a monolayer semiconductor interfaced with a PCS, with suppressed radiation into the far field and line narrowing due to effective disorder averaging, extends the polariton-polariton interaction time, which enhances the nonlinear optical response. In the future, these "dark" states can be accessed through near fields using guided modes excited by grating coupling or by nonlinear frequency conversion. With the strength of the underlying exciton-exciton interaction g X ~1.0 μeV μm 2 , our polaritons exhibit strong exciton-fraction-dependent optical nonlinearities that are fast on a 100 fs time scale.

        <p>Angle-resolved reflectance spectroscopy was performed in a back-focal-plane setup with a slit spectrometer coupled to a liquid-nitrogen-cooled imaging CCD camera (Princeton Instruments SP2500+PyLoN), using white light from a halogen lamp for illumination (see Supplementary Fig. S1). For pump-dependent reflectivity measurements, the sample was excited by 130 fs pulses from a wavelength-tuneable Ti: sapphire oscillator (Spectra-Physics, Tsunami, 80 MHz repetition rate) with wavevector control via laser beam positioning within the back focal plane of the objective. A single-slit optical chopper with a duty cycle of 0.001 was used in the laser beam to avoid sample heating. Angleresolved PL measurements were performed in the same setup with off-resonant excitation by monochromatic light from a HeNe laser with a wavelength λ exc = 632.8 nm. The sample was mounted in an ultra-low-vibration closed-cycle helium cryostat (Advanced Research Systems) and maintained at a controllable temperature in the range of 7 -300 K. The cryostat was mounted onto a precise xyz stage for sample positioning. Spatial filtering in the detection channel was used to selectively measure signals from the 1 L MoSe 2 /hBN/PCS sample area.Angle-resolved reflectance spectroscopy was performed in a back-focal-plane setup with a slit spectrometer coupled to a liquid-nitrogen-cooled imaging CCD camera (Princeton Instruments SP2500+PyLoN), using white light from a halogen lamp for illumination (see Supplementary Fig. S1).
