        <p>The structural and electrochemical properties are presented for the first high-performing commercial oxygen reduction catalyst that is not only platinum group metal (PGM)-free, but also does not use any critical-resource-materials (non-CRM). This Fe-N-C catalyst was specially developed for alkaline media operation and is demonstrated in the cathode of operating anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). With H 2 /O 2 reacting gases, AEMFCs made with Fe-N-C cathodes achieved a record peak power density of 2.1 W cm -2 (&gt; 1 W cm -2 on H 2 /air) and operated with very good voltage durability for more than 100 h. These AEMFCs also realized an iR-corrected current density at 0.9 V of 100 mA cm -2 , well-exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) target for PGM-free cathodes of 44 mA cm -2 . Finally, in a second configuration, Fe-N-C cathodes paired with low-loading PtRu/C anodes (0.125 mg Pt-Ru cm -2 , 0.08 mg Pt cm -2 ) demonstrated a specific power of 10.4 W mg PGM -1 (16.25 W mg Pt -1 ), exceeding the DOE 2022 AEMFC initial performance target for the first time.The structural and electrochemical properties are presented for the first high-performing commercial oxygen reduction catalyst that is not only platinum group metal (PGM)-free, but also does not use any critical-resource-materials (non-CRM).

        <p>To be considered as the ultimate power source for transportation systems and portable devices, low temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells need to overcome significant cost barriers. The long-term U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) goal for the cost of a light-duty vehicle fuel cell system is $30/kW net at a production volume of 500 000 units per year 1,2 . The current estimated cost of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system at this production volume is between $45 3 and $51 4 per kW net . Although the estimated cost at full production volume has reduced significantly in comparison with where it was in the early 2000s, it has been plateaued in recent years 5 , which led some researchers to suggest changing the operating chemistry from acidic to alkaline to create so-called anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs).To be considered as the ultimate power source for transportation systems and portable devices, low temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells need to overcome significant cost barriers.

        <p>The performance and durability of AEMFCs have increased significantly in recent years [6][7][8][9][10][11][12] , with some studies even able to achieve peak power densities of 3.5 W cm -2 13 with H 2 /O 2 gas feeds and more than 2000 hours of continuous operation with less than 5% voltage decay 14 . Where AEMFCs have a true advantage over PEMFCs is the opportunity to lower cost 15 by allowing for cheaper membranes, a wider class of materials for bipolar plates and enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics 16,17 . The latter is expected allow researchers to either significantly reduce or entirely eliminate the Pt in the cathode (one of the primary drivers for high PEMFC cost 18 ). However, all of the above-mentioned achievements for AEMFCs have been made also using platinum group metal (PGM)-based catalysts with a high loading in both the anode and cathode 19,20 . In fact, the total PGM loading of state-of-the-art AEMFCs typically range 1 -1.5 mg PGM cm -2 (ca. 1 mg Pt cm -2 ).The performance and durability of AEMFCs have increased significantly in recent years [6][7][8][9][10][11][12] , with some studies even able to achieve peak power densities of 3.5 W cm -2 13 with H 2 /O 2 gas feeds and more than 2000 hours of continuous operation with less than 5% voltage decay 14 .

        <p>In general, there are two strategies to reduce the amount of PGM in an operating fuel cell: 1) reduce the PGM loading; or 2) develop PGM-free catalysts 21 . Both of these strategies have their own advantages and drawbacks in terms of performance and stability. Given the water management issues with modern AEMFCs 22,23 and the fact that both the ORR and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) experience notable overpotentials 20 it is unlikely that even the interim PGM performance milestones can be achieved by making ultra-thin catalyst layers with low-PGM loading at both electrodes. This suggests that to reduce the PGM loading in operating AEMFCs, there will need to be at least some development of PGM-free catalysts 19 Unfortunately, no high performing PGM-free anode catalysts have been reported -for either PEMFCs or AEMFCs. Because the discovery, understanding and deployment of PGM-free ORR cathodes has been much easier than PGM-free anodes 24 , the most promising configuration to achieve a low-PGM AEMFC is to deploy a high-performing PGM-free cathode with a lowloading PGM anode.In general, there are two strategies to reduce the amount of PGM in an operating fuel cell: 1) reduce the PGM loading; or 2) develop PGM-free catalysts 21 .

        <p>Over the past decade, a variety of PGM-free catalysts have been investigated for the ORR [25][26][27][28][29][30] . Among non-precious metal catalysts, iron and nitrogen co-doped carbon (Fe-N-C) catalysts have been the most promising alternatives to Pt-based catalysts due to their high ORR activity [31][32][33] . In fact, state-of-the art Fe-N-C catalysts often show intrinsic activities very close to Pt and half-wave potentials that exceed 0.85 V. However, the performance of AEMFCs and PEMFCs deploying such catalysts has been low compared with Pt-based cathodes in AEMFCs. This is because in addition to high catalyst activity, reaching high-performance PGM-free cathodes in AEMFCs requires mass transport to be more effectively managed, meaning that material-level structure and electrode engineering will play key roles in determining the electrode-level structure, pore size and distribution, and water management. One thing that has hampered the performance of PGM-free cathodes in the past is the need for high catalyst loading, which leads to thick catalyst layers with inadequate transport rates for both O 2 and H 2 O 34 .Over the past decade, a variety of PGM-free catalysts have been investigated for the ORR [25][26][27][28][29][30] .

        <p>Therefore, this study has two aims. The first is to understand the influence of structurefrom the nano-scale to the mesoscale -on the behavior of Fe-N-C catalysts with single-atom Fe-N x active sites in the AEMFCs cathode. The selected catalyst for this work is a newly commercially available Fe-N-C catalyst that was specifically designed for the operation at AEMFC conditions. As discussed earlier, water is generated on the anode side of AEMFC, which will lead to the substantial drying of the cathode at high current densities. Therefore, this Fe-N-C material was constructed with two changes from conventional materials used in PEMFCs -both intended to make the transport of liquid water more facile in the catalyst layer.Therefore, this study has two aims.

        <p>The first change was to increase the average pore size. The second change was to increase the level of graphitization of the catalyst, decressing its hydrophilicity -as shown in Figure S6 and discussed in the Supporting Information. Importantly, this work not only reports the extremely high activity of Fe-N-C catalyst in ex-situ tests, but the catalyst is also integrated into state-ofthe-art AEMFC electrode structures, enabling record performance to be achieved. The second aim is to develop and deploy ultra-low-PGM loading PtRu/C anodes and to pair them with the Fe-N-C based cathodes to create the first AEMFC that is able to meet U.S. Department of Energy performance milestones.The first change was to increase the average pore size.

        <p>The synthesis method for producting the Fe-N-C catalyst in this work is illustrated in Figure 1 and described in detail in the Methods section. Post-synthesis, the structure of the Fe-N-C catalyst was investigated through a series of physical characterization techniques, Figure 2. Though most of the Fe in the catalyst took the form of single atoms in a Fe-N x configuration, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Figure 2a does show that a small amount of metallic iron was left in the catalyst after acid treatment. The non-Fe peaks in the XRD pattern were broad were a combination of the response from turbostatic carbon and some SiO 2 that remained from the template 35,36 . The carbon-related peaks included were located at 2θ = 25° (002), 45° ((100) and (101)), and 79° (110). Raman spectroscopy (Figure 2b) of the catalyst showed the typical carbon fingerprint peaks 37 , including a peak for the defect-induced D band at 1337 cm -1 and graphitic sp 2 carbon (G band) at 1570 cm -1 as well as the broad 2D bands around 7 2700 cm -1 . The specific surface area and pore size distribution for the catalyst was determined by BET N 2 adsorption and BJH analysis. The Fe-N-C catalyst showed a typical type-IV (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) isotherm, suggesting that the catalyst structure was mesoporous. The catalyst possessed a large specific surface area of 550 m 2 g -1 and a narrow pore size distribution that consisted mainly of pores that were 5 -30 nm (Figure 2c). The primary particle size distribution for the catalyst, determined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis, is shown in Figure 2d. An overwhelming majority of the catalyst particles were less than 1 µm in size, with an average particle diameter of 0.6 µm. When combined, the BET and DLS experiments suggest a catalyst particle that is highly porous, though with a modest size, and high surface area to expose a large fraction of active sites to the reaction zone. This was confirmed by high resolution microscopy, as discussed below. Figure 3a shows an SEM image of the catalyst surface structure, which confirms the BET and DLS results above. First, a typical particle had an average diameter of ca. 1 micron. Also, the throughout the catalyst, pores ranging in diameter from 5 to 40 nm were observed throughout. Such large pores are desirable for fuel cell operation as they provide high accessibility features to the active centers and play an important role in mass transfer because large pores are less likely to be blocked by liquid water. Figure 3b shows a 2D TEM image of the catalyst primary particle. Since the electron beam passes through the sample and reaches the detector, this image is able to provide a "see-through" visual confirmation of the pore structure throughout the catalyst. The z-contrast dark-field STEM images of the Fe-N-C catalyst were also collected to further understand the atomic distribution throughout the catalyst, with a particular interest in determining how many of the Fe atoms in the catalyst existed as single atoms in the Fe-N-C vs. agglomerated Fe particles. Here, because Fe is the heaviest element, it will show up as the brightest element in the z-contrast STEM images. Figure 3c shows a representative catalyst particle on the holly carbon STEM substrate, showing that Fe was well-dispersed over the entire catalyst. There was no evidence of agglomerated Fe particles at this scale. EDS mapping (Figures 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g, 3h, and 3i) also suggests that the catalyst composition is homogenous.The synthesis method for producting the Fe-N-C catalyst in this work is illustrated in Figure 1 and described in detail in the Methods section.

        <p>Importantly, both N and Fe are clearly evenly dispersed throughout the catalyst.Importantly, both N and Fe are clearly evenly dispersed throughout the catalyst.</p>
        <p>To further probe the Fe distribution throughout the catalyst, atomically resolved STEM images are shown in Figure 4. A few Fe nanoparticles were found in each catalyst particle (Figure 4a-b), though very few large agglomerated particles were present. In fact, of over 100 particles imaged, only three large Fe nanoparticles greater than 10 nm were observed. What this means is that an overwhelming majority of the Fe in the catalyst was present as single atoms, which is supported by the STEM image in Figure 4c, which was taken near the edge of a single pore. The STEM images also support that the Fe single-atoms were present both on the primary surface, but also on the catalyst surface within the pores, which explains why some of the single atoms in Figure 3c appear blurry. To help the eye to more clearly see the single atom sites, a selection of Fe atoms is circled in Figure 4d. . The later findings suggests that the density of Fe-N x sites still can be increased, providing a guidance to the future research on PGM-free catalysts.To further probe the Fe distribution throughout the catalyst, atomically resolved STEM images are shown in Figure 4.

        <p>The activity and selectivity towards ORR of the Fe-N-C catalyst in O 2 -saturated 0.10 M KOH is shown in Figure 5. During cyclic voltammetry (CV), the catalyst exhibited a welldefined ORR reduction peak between 0.8 V and 0.9 V vs. RHE. To better understand the ORR kinetics and mechanism, the Fe-N-C catalyst was deposited onto a glassy carbon rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) and linear sweep voltammetry (10 mV s -1 ) was done at several rotation rates between 400 -2500 rpm (Figure 5b), to calculate the H 2 O 2 yield and average number of electrons transferred (n). The half-wave potential for the catalyst in this work was 0.846 V, which is one of the highest values reported 34,38,39 for a Fe-N-C catalyst, which is only 20 mV more negative than commercial 40 wt% Pt/C (0.866 V, for a RDE with 20 μg cm -2 loading, Figure 5b), indicating excellent ORR activity in alkaline media. The peroxide yield at the ring and the calculated n value (details in the Methods section) are shown in Figure 3c. The average value for n was 3.967 over the entire potential window; however, between 0.6 V-1 V (where the cathode actually would operate in an AEMFC) the n value was 3.99 (Figure 5d). In this potential range the H 2 O 2 % is less than 1 which is very good for a PGM-free catalyst. The high activity of this Fe-N-catalyst, in addition to its high surface area and open structure, make it an ideal replacement for PGM material in the AEMFC cathode.The activity and selectivity towards ORR of the Fe-N-C catalyst in O 2 -saturated 0.10 M KOH is shown in Figure 5.

        <p>Figure 6a shows polarization curves for an AEMFC with a Fe-N-C cathode (1 mg cm -2 ) and PtRu/C (0.6 mg cm -2 ) anode. The AEM used in all tests was a high density polyethylene-(HDPE) with benzyltrimethylammoniam cationic head groups 9 . To achieve high-performing, long-life, PGM-free AEMFCs, there are operational conditions concerns that must be addressed beyond catalytic limitations, such as water management 20 . This is shown in Figure 6a. For operation at low temperature and full humidity (anode/cathode/cell temperatures of 60 o C/60 o C/60 o C) the cell performance is low because of high water accumulation at the anode. One effective strategy to enhance AEMFC performance is to adjust the relative humidity (via the dew points) of the inlet gases during cell operation 40 and to increase the cell temperature.Figure 6a shows polarization curves for an AEMFC with a Fe-N-C cathode (1 mg cm -2 ) and PtRu/C (0.6 mg cm -2 ) anode.

        <p>Reducing the dewpoints below full saturation allows for convective evaporation of water into the anode flow-field, reducing the amount of water in the anode ionomer as well as the amount of ionomer swelling 41 . In Figure 6a 6a), the peak power density was further increased to 1.9 W cm -2 . Finally, in AEMFCs backpressurization reduces water evaporation in the electrode by increasing its boiling point. Though this can be problematic for the anode side 11 , increased liquid water in the AEMFC cathode can actually improve cell performance by reducing Ohmic resistance and providing increased concentration of reactive water. In this cell, applying backpressure to the anode led to a decrease in the cell performance while applying backpressure to the cathode always led to an increase in cell performance. This is shown in Figure 6a where 200 kPa backpressure was applied under the previous optimum dew points at 80 o C (blue line). The result was an extremely high peak power density of 2.05 W cm -2 and a current density at 0.4 V of 7.4 A cm -2 .Reducing the dewpoints below full saturation allows for convective evaporation of water into the anode flow-field, reducing the amount of water in the anode ionomer as well as the amount of ionomer swelling 41 .

        <p>There are some very important observations to note here. First, as shown in Figure 7, the peak power density and maximum current density are new literature records for polymer membrane fuel cells using a PGM-free cathode, especially taking into account that Fe-N-C loading was ~4x lower compared to the previously reported performances 20,28,29,34,[42][43][44][45][46][47][48] . This is true not only when this data is compared to previous AEMFCs (Figures 7a-b) but this is also true when compared to the best-reported PEMFCs in the literature as well (Figures 7c-d). The performance of top-performing AEMFCs with a PGM-free cathode are also summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.There are some very important observations to note here.

        <p>Next, an identical cell to the one discussed in Figure 6a was exposed to a short-term 150 h durability test operating at 600 mA cm -2 . This is important as Fe-N-C catalysts in PEMFCs have shown particularly poor durability due to radical attack and oxidative instability 41,[50][51][52] .Next, an identical cell to the one discussed in Figure 6a was exposed to a short-term 150 h durability test operating at 600 mA cm -2 .

        <p>The results of the durability test are shown in Figure 6b. For this cell, the reacting gas flow rates were both 0.3 L min -1 , and no backpressure was applied. The initial anode/cathode reacting gas dew points were 74 o C/78 o C, though the dew points were slightly adjusted (± 0.5 o C) during the test to maintain adequate humidification. To match the high beginning-of-life performance, this AEMFC setup also showed outstanding durability compared to previous literature. The voltage decay rate was only 0.46 mV h -1 and the HFR only increased by around 1 mΩ during the experiment. This is the first time that an AEMFC containing a nonprecious cathode was reported to operate over 100 h with the cell voltage remaining above 0.6 V (0.68V -0.611V). The best result for an AEMFC with a PGM-free cathode in the literature is a 100 h H 2 /air(CO 2 -free) cell with the operated voltage decaying at a rate of 1 mV h -1 44 . The best PEMFC durability in the literature over 100 h operation at 600 mA cm -2 was a degradation rate of 0.2 mV h -1 , but with a lower cell voltage (0.55V -0.5V) during the durability test 53 .The results of the durability test are shown in Figure 6b.

        <p>Then, to evaluate the feasibility of the Fe-N-C cathodes for more practical applications, cells were also tested with simulated air (CO 2 free) as the oxidant (Figure 6c). Positively, the Fe-N-C cathode supported a mass transport limited current density of 3.4 A cm -2 and achieved a peak power density of just over 1 W cm -2 . Compared to prior reported results for PGM-free H 2 /air(CO 2 -free) AEMFCs in the literature (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information) 28,44 , the Fe-N-C catalyst in this work showed greatly enhanced performance. Both values were the highest values reported in the literature to date. Additional tests to show the advancement of these materials, and PGM-free AEMFC cathodes in general, towards realistic operation were also done, with a specific goal of satisfying important U.S. Department of Energy targets. The first test in this regard was informed by the polarization curve for the best-performing cell in Figure 6a, where the apparent current density at 0.9 V was approximately 125 mA/cm 2 . This appeared to satisfy the DOE target for PGM-free cathodes of 44 mA/cm 2 . However, the condition in that experiment was not identical to the DOE protocol, and the experiment was transient (10 mV/s scan rate). Therefore, an experiment was run with a 0.6 mg Pt cm -2 anode and 1.0 mg Fe-N-C cm -2 cathode at steady state at the DOE-defined protocols: 0.9 V (iR free), cell temperature 80°C, and 100 kPa backpressure to both sides of the cell. The result is shown in Figure 6e, where the steady-state current density at 0.9 V (iR-free) was 100 mA/cm 2 , which is more than twice the DOE target. It is also noteworthy that this value is quite close to an identical cell that had a high loading Pt/C cathode electrode (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), where a current density at 0.9 V (iR-free) of 131 mA cm -2 and a peak power density of 2.6 W cm -2 were achieved, though the operating conditions were slightly different.

The AEM used was a HDPE-based radiation-grafted benzyltrimethylammonium type (ion-exchange capacity IEC = 2.4 mmol g -1 ) 9 , while the ETFE-based benzyltrimethylammonium-type radiation-grafted ionomer powders (IEC = 1.24 ± 0.06 mmol g -1 ) were 20% by solid mass of the catalyst layers. Finally, cells were assembled with the specific goal of meeting the U.S. DOE 2022 milestone for AEMFCs: beginning of life operating voltage of 0.65 V at 1 A cm -2 operating on H 2 /O 2 reacting gases with a total PGM loading less than 0.2 mg cm -2 55 . To do this, a Fe-N-C cathode was paired with an anode with a very low loading of PtRu/C. The total PGM loading of the AEMFC tested here was 0.125 mg PtRu cm -2 (0.08 mg Pt cm -2 ). The value of 0.125 mg PGM cm -2 was chosen to show that these cells could meet both early AEMFC and mature PEMFC targets 56,57 . These very low PGM loading cells were able to support a high peak power density of 1.3 W cm -2 under H 2 /O 2 reacting gases (Figure 6d), yielding a remarkable specific power output of 16 W mg -1 Pt , the highest of any AEMFC reported to date (Figure 7).Then, to evaluate the feasibility of the Fe-N-C cathodes for more practical applications, cells were also tested with simulated air (CO 2 free) as the oxidant (Figure 6c).

        <p>Under steady-state operation at 1 A cm -2 , the low loading cell was able to achieve a stable operating voltage of 0.66V (Figure 6f), which not only presents the first time that any AEMFC has met the 2022 performance milestone but it was able to do so with 62% of the "allowed" PGM loading for AEMFCs and exactly the allowable target for PEMFCs (the DOE 2020 PGM target for PEMFCs is 0.125mg PGM cm -2 56,57 ). The promising results in Figure 6 clearly demonstrate that ultra-low-loading PGM AEMFCs are coming closer to a reality. By meeting the 2022 DOE milestone, and showing that PGM-free AEMFC cathodes can clearly surpass the long-difficult DOE target of 44 mA/cm 2 , this moves the field forward towards the eventual goal: completely PGM-free AEMFCs with high performance and long life.Under steady-state operation at 1 A cm -2 , the low loading cell was able to achieve a stable operating voltage of 0.66V (Figure 6f), which not only presents the first time that any AEMFC has met the 2022 performance milestone but it was able to do so with 62% of the "allowed" PGM loading for AEMFCs and exactly the allowable target for PEMFCs (the DOE 2020 PGM target for PEMFCs is 0.125mg PGM cm -2 56,57 ).

The catalyst also showed excellent in-situ kinetics. Specifically, at 0.9 V (iR-free) a current density of 100 mA cm -2 was achieved, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy target for PGM-free cathodes of 44 mA cm -2 .

        <p>The Fe-N-C catalyst used in this work is commercially available from Pajarito Powder LLC (PMF11904). It is manufactured using the VariPore™ method, which was modified for this material to use Pipemidic acid (PA) instead of other common materials such as aminoantipyrine (AAPyr). There two main reasons for selection of PA. The first is related to higher nitrogen content because the ratio between C-Nx, as well as amount of carbon atoms, helps to drive the formation of Fe-N-C catalysts with a higher density of Fe-Nx centers. The more carbon you have, the higher the number of positions in the graphene sheets that are available for the insertion of active sites. PA has more than 20% higher of carbon in the structure compared to AAPyr). The second, and main, reason that PA was used is that the amino groups in AAPyr are easily oxidized (even at room temperature) by iron nitrate and do not participate in formation of Fe-Nx active sites.The Fe-N-C catalyst used in this work is commercially available from Pajarito Powder LLC (PMF11904).

        <p>To remove impurities and ion exchange the quaternary ammonium groups, the anode GDE, cathode GDE, and anion exchange membrane (AEM) were hydrated in DI water for 20 min and then soaked three times in aqueous 1.0 M KOH. The AEMs used in this study were radiation-grafted high-density polyethylene (HDPE) type with covalently-bound benzyltrimethylammonium (BTMA) cationic head-groups (20 μm when hydrated, IEC = 2.4 mmol g -1 ). 60 Cells were assembled in-cell without prior hot pressing in 5 cm 2 The low Pt loading anode Gas diffusion electrode (GDE) was fabricated by introducing a microporous layer (MPL) onto the Toray GDL (TGP-H-060 5 wt% wet proofed) with a subsequent catalyst layer deposition. In this fabrication technique, two types of inks were prepared separately and sprayed onto the GDL. Firstly, the ink for MPL was prepared by mixing AEI with carbon (Vulcan XC-72R)(AEI:C ratio of 0.417:1 wt) and PTFE (8 wt%). The AEI was soaked in DI water for 30 min before the Vulcan and PTFE were added. The ingredients were mixed to form uniform slurry. IPA was used as solvent and was added to the slurry to make a dilute mixture which was then transferred to a vial and sonicated for 1 h to make uniform ink. The same procedure was applied to make the catalyst ink where, AEI, PtRubased electrocatalyst, additional Vulcan and (AEI:C:Pt ratio of 0.417:1.5:1 wt) PTFE (8 wt%) were used.. The MPL was built by spraying the first ink on the GDL and then the catalyst layer was built by spraying second ink onto the MPL. The PGM loading was calculated by mass difference before and after spraying.To remove impurities and ion exchange the quaternary ammonium groups, the anode GDE, cathode GDE, and anion exchange membrane (AEM) were hydrated in DI water for 20 min and then soaked three times in aqueous 1.0 M KOH. The AEMs used in this study were radiation-grafted high-density polyethylene (HDPE) type with covalently-bound benzyltrimethylammonium (BTMA) cationic head-groups (20 μm when hydrated, IEC = 2.4 mmol g -1 ). 60 Cells were assembled in-cell without prior hot pressing in 5 cm 2 The low Pt loading anode Gas diffusion electrode (GDE) was fabricated by introducing a microporous layer (MPL) onto the Toray GDL (TGP-H-060 5 wt% wet proofed) with a subsequent catalyst layer deposition. In this fabrication technique, two types of inks were prepared separately and sprayed onto the GDL. Firstly, the ink for MPL was prepared by mixing AEI with carbon (Vulcan XC-72R)(AEI:C ratio of 0.417:1 wt) and PTFE (8 wt%). The AEI was soaked in DI water for 30 min before the Vulcan and PTFE were added. The ingredients were mixed to form uniform slurry. IPA was used as solvent and was added to the slurry to make a dilute mixture which was then transferred to a vial and sonicated for 1 h to make uniform ink. The same procedure was applied to make the catalyst ink where, AEI, PtRubased electrocatalyst, additional Vulcan and (AEI:C:Pt ratio of 0.417:1.5:1 wt) PTFE (8 wt%) were used.. The MPL was built by spraying the first ink on the GDL and then the catalyst layer was built by spraying second ink onto the MPL. The PGM loading was calculated by mass difference before and after spraying.</p>
