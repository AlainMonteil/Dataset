        <p>PEMFC tests using large size single cell (50 cm 2 ) by Johnson Matthey Fuel Cells. Anode electrocatalyst layer ink was prepared by wetting an anode catalyst material with a PFSA ionomer (800 EW) dispersed in water / propan-1-ol mix. The anode electrocatalyst material was 20 % Pt/ XC72R. Cathode electrocatalyst layer inks were prepared by wetting the non-PGM Fe-NC catalyst material with a PFSA ionomer (Nafion® 1100 EW) dispersed in water/propan-1-ol mix at ionomer to carbon ratio of 50% by weight. The ink was then processed by ball milling using five YZr 5 mm beads per gram of catalyst powder to form a well dispersed ink.</p>
        <p>Catalyst coated ion-conducting membranes of 50 cm 2 active area were prepared by depositing the anode ink and cathode inks onto PTFE sheets to form electrocatalyst layers and transferring the appropriate layers to either side of PFSA reinforced Gore Back Up Power membrane (15 µm thickness) at temperatures of between 150 °C to 200 °C. The cathode non-PGM electrocatalyst catalyst loading was 1.0 mgC cm -2 and the anode electrocatalyst loading was 0.1 mgPt cm -2 .</p>
        <p>A gas diffusion layer was applied to each face of each catalyst coated ion-conducting membrane to form the complete membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). The anode gas diffusion layer used was Toray TGPH 60 and the cathode gas diffusion layer was SGL 22 BB.</p>
        <p>For the electrochemical characterisation in single cell, pure oxygen and air were used as cathode reactants and pure H2 as the anode reactant (all gases of 99.9% purity).</p>
        <p>Stoichiometric flow rates of anode (s = 2 for H2) and cathode (s = 9.5 for O2 and s = 2 for air) reactants were used at current densities &gt; 0.2 A cm -2 and constant flows (corresponding to 0.2 A cm -2 stoichiometric flows) at current densities &lt; 0.2 A cm -2 . Reactant humidification was achieved by bubbling the gases through water reservoirs, the temperatures of which were calibrated to yield the desired relative humidity (RH) values. Humidity and cell pressure were measured at the inlet for both electrodes. Cell resistances as a function of current density (i.e., the sum of the proton-conduction resistance in the membrane and the various electronic resistances, bulk and contact resistances) were determined using an AC perturbation of 1 kHz. For each current density value, the cell voltage was allowed stabilized for 10 min before the voltage was recorded. Multiple-path serpentine flow-field plates (two and three parallel channels for the anode and cathode, respectively) made from machined, sealed graphite blocks were used for testing.</p>
        <p>The MEAs were conditioned by the application of a constant voltage of 0.62 V under H2-air at 1.7 bar gauge inlet pressure, 100% RH and 80°C. The current density was monitored until a stable value was observed. The conditioning step lasted 1 hour unless specified otherwise.</p>
        <p>Polarisation curves in 50 cm 2 single cells were performed in H2-O2 and air at 1.7 bar gauge inlet pressure, 80 °C and using a relative humidity at the cell inlet of 100% RH. The cell current density was held for 10 min at each point and the cell voltage was averaged over the last minute of this hold. The cell voltage under H2-air was recorded in the descending voltage direction, from low currents to high currents.</p>
        <p>Calculation of iron surface site density as a function of catalyst specific surface area (semi-infinite graphene like sheets) Figure 1a (in the main manuscript) displays the available iron surface site density as a function of iron content and specific surface area of the catalyst. For the determination of site density as a function of specific surface area and wt%(Fe), we use a simple geometrical model in which we assume the catalyst is composed of iron sites randomly embedded within graphene like sheets of semi-infinite dimensions (below we consider the case where the dimensions are not semi-infinite). The graphene like sheets form multi-layer structures which contain both surface iron sites and internal iron sites associated with buried iron. The total number of sites is then the accessible number on the surface.</p>
        <p>For this simple model we assume that the iron sites are composed of an iron substituting a carbon within a graphene-like carbon-sheet. Although this geometric construct is slightly different from the actual site within the catalysts, and assumes that the iron inserted within the hexagonal lattice does not significantly distort the lattice, it retains the fundamental geometric constraints and is applicable in the range where iron content is low (Fe &lt; 5 at%).</p>
        <p>Although iron content is typically specified in wt%, for determining the site density, it is more applicable to use at% iron. We convert from wt%(Fe) to at%(Fe) (neglecting the presence of nitrogen, which is only present at a low level, and in any case has a similar atomic mass to carbon) using</p>
        <p>Where ‫ܯ‬ሺ‫݁ܨ‬ሻ is the atomic mass of Fe (55.85 g mol -1 ) and ‫ܯ‬ሺ‫ܥ‬ሻ is the atomic mass of carbon (12.00 g mol -1 ). A plot of this function, which is almost linear over the typical range of wt%(Fe) in these catalysts is provided below in Supplementary Fig. 1.</p>
        <p>Supplementary Fig. 1. Conversion of wt%(Fe) to at%(Fe).</p>
        <p>The carbon-carbon bond-length in graphene like sheets is 0.1421 nm 1 and we can use an analysis similar to that for carbon nanotubes to estimate the total surface area and number of exposed sites in graphene. As the carbons are in a hexagonal lattice, the area taken up by each carbon atom on the basal surface is ‫ܣ‬ ௦௧,௦ ൌ √ଷ ଶ ‫ݎ‬ ି ଶ ൌ2.62×10 -20 m 2 (this is also the area taken up by one iron atom as we assume that the structure is not distorted when we substitute an iron for a carbon atom). This then implies that one side of a graphene sheet should have a specific surface area of 1316 m 2 g -1 (i.e. 2632 m 2 g -1 for samples composed of semi-infinite graphene sheets when including both sides). Note that this surface area decreases as in the</p>
        <p>Fe wt% real catalyst the graphene sheets will stack on top of each other and may not be infinite in dimension, and thus have edge sites (see below for further discussion).</p>
        <p>Assuming the case of semi-infinite sheets (this case will be relaxed in a later section), and assuming we have n-layers of graphene sheets (n≥1), iron atoms will be exposed on the top and bottom surfaces, and there will be n-2 (n≥2) layers within the structure in which the iron atoms are buried and thus unable to be accessed. With 2 layers of graphene sheets (n=2), and a surface area of 1316 m 2 g -1 all of the iron is exposed and there can be no buried iron. With one graphene sheet, the specific surface area is doubled (2632 m 2 g -1 ), and the iron atoms can be accessed from both sides, but we still count each iron atom only once. The total surface area will be 2 × 1316/n m 2 g -1 in the case of pure graphene sheets, and somewhat less as we introduce iron because of the increase in specific density of the material. Although n is shown as a whole number, in reality, n can continuously vary if we assume that the material has a mixture of different numbers of layers (e.g. some 2-layer and some 3-layer). We also need to take into account the iron content, as this will modify the total mass per given surface area.</p>
        <p>The maximum iron site density, ‫ݔܽܯ‬ ‫݁ܨ‬ ‫݁ݐ݅ܵ‬ ‫ݕݐ݅ݏ݊݁ܦ‬ (sites g -1 -i.e. total possible number of iron sites, if all iron is on the surface) is associated with the wt%(Fe).</p>
        <p>Where ܰ is Avogadros constant. The total number of available sites in any given catalyst with specific surface area, SSA (m 2 g -1 ) is the SSA divided by the area of each site</p>
        <p>The number of these sites which are iron sites, assuming that the iron is uniformly distributed throughout the material is</p>
        <p>The total number of iron sites is limited to the maximum site density at which all iron atoms are on the surface. This is because at very high specific surface areas (i.e. when we have only single graphene sheets), each iron can potentially be double counted (once from each side), and it makes sense to consider one iron=one site, even if it can be accessed from two sides.</p>
        <p>The above equation also assumes that the iron is uniformly distributed in the catalyst: if the iron preferentially segregates to the surface, then the surface site density will be higher than this value, and if the iron segregates to the bulk, then it will be less.</p>
        <p>The approach used above considers that graphene sheets are semi-infinite, but in reality they have a limited size, and so there will also be adsorption sites at the edges of the graphene sheets, and indeed there also might be iron sites situated at those positions too as we assume random distribution of iron.</p>
        <p>In order to estimate the effect this has on the above model, we modify it to consider a graphene sheet of fixed lateral dimension ‫ܮ(‬ ሻ which forms a stack of n-layers. We can approximate this to a cylinder where the spacing between the layers is equal to the typical intergraphene spacing, ‫ݎ‬ ௬ = 0.3354 nm 2 (this analysis also works in general for other geometries provided they do not have a high aspect ratio)</p>
        <p>‫ܮ‬ can be estimated from analysis of the Raman spectra of the samples, and we do so in Supplementary Note 3, where we estimate ‫ܮ‬ to be 7.3±0.3 nm for our Fe-NC Δ-DCDA catalyst.</p>
        <p>The total area of such a cylindrical stack is</p>
        <p>The total number of atoms exposed is composed of basal and edge atoms. The atoms at the edge of the basal (top and bottom) planes are all counted as edge atoms, and we need to make sure we don't double count them when we count the top and bottom faces, thus for the simple cylinder we have above</p>
        <p>The ratio of the two components allows us to determine whether the surface area is dominated by basal or edge surface atoms</p>
        <p>Where we approximate the number of surface atoms by the ratio of area and boundary distance to site area and bond length respectively. Expanding ‫ܣ‬ ௦௧,௦ we have</p>
        <p>Or the proportion of basal plan sites is</p>
        <p>ܵ ௦ /ܵ ௗ and ܴ ௦ are then general parameters for the catalyst. Using the parameters above we can then calculate the proportion of basal sites as a function of the number of sheets in the stack and the lateral size of the stack. We see that for all practical catalysts with moderately high surface areas (see below), the number of basal atoms is always the majority.</p>
        <p>For a catalyst like ours, for which ‫ܮ‬ =7.3nm, the number of basal atoms is ≥85%.</p>
        <p>Supplementary Fig. Note we need to calculate the number of surface atoms separately from the surface area as there are two distances -the interplane spacing, ‫ݎ‬ ௬ , and the carbon-carbon bond length, ‫ݎ‬ ି . This means the effective area of each type of atom (basal or edge) is different. The area taken up by an edge atom is larger than that of a basal atom because of the larger inter-plane spacing and is determined by the area of the sides of the cylinder divided by the number of sites</p>
        <p>Thus an edge atom takes up about 81% more surface area then a basal atom. The number of iron sites which exist as basal or edge sites in one cylinder is then the total number of atoms of that type multiplied by the proportion of atoms which are iron atoms (i.e. the product of ܵ ௦ ܽ‫%ݐ‬ሺ‫݁ܨ‬ሻ and ܵ ௗ ܽ‫%ݐ‬ሺ‫݁ܨ‬ሻ, respectively). The total weight of one of these cylinders is then the total number of atoms weighted by the composition</p>
        <p>The specific surface area of this geometry is then the area divided by the mass</p>
        <p>Solving this for the number of layers required to achieve the SSA for a given sheet size we get</p>
        <p>Which is the number of layers in the cylindrical particles. For a given particle, n can only be a whole number, but averaged over multiple particles, ݊ can have a continuous value. As the sheet size gets large ‫ܮ(‬ → ∞) the area becomes dominated by the area of the basal planes as expected, and the result becomes the same as that calculated for infinite graphene sheets above.</p>
        <p>The addition of edge sites increases the specific area of the catalyst. For pure graphene, the specific surface area increases from 2632 m 2 g -1 to about 2975 m 2 g -1 as we move from semi infinite single graphene sheets to sheets which are only 5 nm in size.</p>
        <p>Supplementary Fig. 3. Number of layers needed to achieve a specific surface area for given domain sizes for a 7 wt%(Fe) (i.e. 1.6 at%(Fe)) catalyst. The dashed line shows the specific Fe-NC surface area surface area of the catalysts produced in this paper ~1100 m 2 g -1 . The specific case for our catalyst (La=7.3 nm) is shown.</p>
        <p>The ultimate surface area achievable increases as the domain size gets smaller due to the extra surface area. Supplementary Fig. 3 shows the calculated number of layers needed in order to achieve a specific surface area for a 1.6 at%(Fe) catalyst (i.e. the 7 wt% catalyst used in this paper) as a function of the domain size of the graphene sheets (3-50 nm). For the ca 1100 m 2 g -1 surface area we have used, this implies that the number of layers is in the range 4.6-2.3 with increasing domain size. For the specific case of ‫ܮ‬ =7.3 nm, the average number of layers of graphene like sheets is 2.86.</p>
        <p>Supplementary Fig. 4. Proportion of sites which are on the basal surface for 7 wt%(Fe) (i.e. 1.6 at%(Fe)) catalyst with 1100 m 2 g -1 surface area. The numbers under the points are the graphene sheet size (nm).</p>
        <p>Supplementary Fig. 4 shows the proportion of sites that are on the basal plane (the other sites are edge sites). For the value of ‫ܮ‬ of our catalyst (7.3 nm), random distribution of iron sites would mean that 9% of the surface sites are at the edges and 91% are on the basal graphene plane (note that this is not the percentage of total iron sites, as some will be buried between layers, vide infra). If the edge sites and basal sites had the same surface area, then there would be no effect on the surface site density, but as the edge sites are about 81% larger in area, we need to take the ratio of edge sites to basal sites in account when assessing the surface site density. In the simple case we present in the main paper, the total surface site density is calculated assuming all sites are equivalent, and surface site density is just the site density multiplied by the at%(Fe) (Eq 4). We now need to take into account that there are two sites, with different areas, so we can take a weighted average to get an average site area based on the proportion of the two different sites.</p>
        <p>And the surface site density in Fig. 1a of the main paper then needs to be scaled by ‫ܣ‬ ௦௧,௦ ‫ܣ/‬ ௦௧,௩ , with the change in site density shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. For a catalyst with a specific surface area of 1100 m 2 g -1 the surface site density when it is composed of 7.3 nm graphene sheets is reduced to 93% of that of infinite graphene sheets.</p>
        <p>Supplementary Fig. 5. Variation of surface site density as a function of graphene sheet size for 7 wt%(Fe) (1.6 at%(Fe)) catalysts.</p>
        <p>As we know the total number of iron sites from the at% loading (7.55×10 20 sites g -1 ), and we also know the total number of surface sites 6.54×10 20 sites g -1 and the percentage of surface sites that are basal sites (91.1%) we can classify the iron sites into the three different sitesbasal, edge and buried, where the latter is associated with iron not on the surface of the catalyst. Errors are calculated based upon propagation of the uncertainty of ‫ܮ‬ .</p>
        <p>Fig. 1b (in the main manuscript) provides information about the required turnover frequency and site density in order to achieve specific technological targets for non-precious catalysts (geometric current density of 0.044 A cm -2 at 0.90 V), and compares those to the performance requirements of precious metal catalysts under the same conditions which are 0.44 mA mgPt -1 at a loading of 0.1 mgPt cm -2 at 0.90 V -i.e. the same geometric current density of 0.044 A cm -2 .</p>
        <p>The geometric current density is associated with surface site density ‫ݏ݁ݐ݅ݏ‪ሾ‬ܦܵ(‬ ݃ ିଵ ሿ), turnover frequency ‫ݏ݊ݎݐ݈ܿ݁݁‪ሾ‬ܨܱܶ(‬ ‫݁ݐ݅ݏ‬ ିଵ ‫ݏ‬ ିଵ ሿ), and catalyst loading (݈‫݃݊݅݀ܽ‬ሾ݃ ܿ݉ ିଶ ሿ)</p>
        <p>Hence it is trivial to generate a plot of ‫ܦܵ‬ ‫.ݏݒ‬ ‫ܨܱܶ‬ on which lines represent the performance the catalysts need to achieve in order to meet the required geometric current.</p>
        <p>Similarly for platinum-based catalysts, it can be seen that if we assume all surface sites are equally active, then we can determine the number of available surface sites to the specific surface area of the catalyst by using the average surface area of one platinum atom.</p>
        <p>Raman is a common technique for carbon-based materials. 3 For graphitic like material,</p>
        <p>Raman spectroscopy usually has four different peaks between 1000 cm -1 and 1750 cm -1 . Two major peaks are at 1573-1600 cm -1 and 1340-1356 cm -1 , which are corresponding to graphitic peak(G) and disorder peak(D) respectively. 4 Those two peaks are due to different vibration mode of graphene (E2g and A1g). 5 The other two minor peak are at 1451-1531 cm -1 and 1144-1190 cm -1 and they are amorphous carbon (Am) and pentacene (P) peaks. Usually, P peaks is not visible for carbon blacks because at 1140 cm -1 , it is the disordered sp 3 -bonded carbon for diamond thin films. 6 Nevertheless, some sp2-bonded carbon on hydrocarbons also have an obvious peak; therefore, it was also selected for fitting. 4 In 1970, Tuinstra and Koenig reported that the intensity ratio of disorder peak and graphitic peak (ID/IG) is inversely proportional to the crystallite in plane size of carbon(La). 5 Knight and White later used the 514.5 nm laser (Elaser = 2.41 eV) and concluded with an empirical expression: 7</p>
        <p>However, Cancado et al. found that the intensity of peaks depends on the energy of laser used, which suggests that the equation should be generalised for laser energy, and they reported the equation: 8</p>
        <p>where El is the excitation laser energy in eV and AD and AG are the integrated intensity of D and G peaks. The equation can be converted with ߣ in nm units: 8</p>
        <p>Also, this equation is more suitable for the diamond-like carbon (DLC) films, which has both sp 2 and sp 3 carbon, and the D and G peaks are discrete with narrow D bands. 9 Seong et al.</p>
        <p>also pointed that the calculation based on the ratio of integrated intensity is more comparable with HR-TEM image compared with the calculation based on the ratio of intensity. 9 Raman spectra (λ=532nm) of the Fe-NC Δ-DCDA catalyst were measured at a large number of positions (n=10), and the peaks (D, G, Am and P) fitted to a Lorentzian line shape with their positions constrained to the values listed above 4 . Supplementary Fig. 11 shows Using the ratio of areas of the peaks -which considering the somewhat disordered nature of the material seems the appropriate approach -determined from the fits and equation 19 After 10 h @ 0.8 V After 10 h @ 0.7 V After 10 h @ 0.4 V Before @0.8 V Before @0.7 V Before @0.4 V Z'' / Ω cm 2 Z' / Ω cm 2</p>

        <p>XAS results on Zn-NC, Fe-NC U and Fe-NC Δ-DCDA XAS results clearly confirm the formation of Zn-N4 moieties in Zn-NC matrix (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 4). From combined XAS (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Figs. 1314) and Mossbauer (Fig. 3c) data, it is established that the Fe-N4 sites and sub-nanometric size of Fe2O3 particles co-exist in Fe-NC U catalyst. Although Wu's group and many others have claimed that Fe 2+ can replace Zn 2+ in ZIF (nonpyrolysed ZIF), there was actually no experimental demonstration for that, and it is also possible that the Fe 2+ (with counteranions) may very well be in the cavities of ZIF-8, not replacing Zn 2+ in the crystal structure. Besides, here Fe cations are "adsorbed/transmetallated" with planar Zn-N4 moieties in pyrolysed ZIF-8-based conductive carbon matrix -nothing to do with the Zn-N4 tetrahedra existing in non-pyrolysed ZIF-8.</p>
        <p>As Zn-NC matrix consists of abundant Zn-N4 sites (25 wt% Zn as determined by ICP-MS), this apparently provides plenty of planar -NC ligands (after Zn leaching) to stabilise Fe-N4 sites preventing Fe agglomeration during the activation step. From the bond length values provided in Supplementary Table 4, a contraction of the Fe-N distance after activation is observed (2.09 Å in Fe-NC U vs 2.02 Å in Fe-NC</p>
        <p>) which is also visible in the Fe-C distance (3.5 Å in Fe-NC U vs 3.1 and 3.5 Å in Fe-NC Δ-DCDA , which again on average shows a "contraction"). That seems to show there was a reorganization around the Fe ion during the "activation".</p>
        <p>The signal intensity with Fe-NC U was very low (Fig. 3c), explaining the strong noise in the spectrum. This may reflect that the Fe atoms are loosely connected to N-C in the unactivated catalyst (strong recoil when absorbing gamma-rays i.e. many Fe atoms do not contribute to Mӧssbauer signal).</p>
        <p>This technique electrochemically quantifies the Fe-N4 sites under meaningful conditions (in a liquid electrolyte of pH 5. As such, this method probes all sites accessible to the gas phase, an unknown number of which might be electrochemically silent towards the ORR, and so it can be assumed to represent an upper bound on the number of sites. For the Fe-NC U , the SD(CO) is 7 times greater than SD(nitrite). This difference of 7x between the two techniques is significantly above what has been observed hitherto for highly ORR-active Fe-NC obtained after high temperature pyrolysis. This suggests that the Fe species present on the top surface (subnanometric Fe2O3 particles are known to be on top of the surface based on the synthesis protocol) in Fe-NC U behaves differently with CO and nitrite from those in Fe-NC Δ-DCDA .</p>
        <p>While the nitrite stripping is liable to be more specific to Fe-Nx sites for counting, it is possible that the CO method either counts the sub-nanometric Fe2O3 particles present in Fe-NC U or alternatively, the sub-nanometric Fe2O3 is converted to Fe-Nx or Fe(0) sites during the cleaning step in reductive atmosphere at 600 °C that precedes the CO chemisorption measurement. Cyclic voltammetry measurements of the MEAs were done within the fuel cell at 50 mV s -1 and using nitrogen on the cathode (hydrogen on the anode) at 80 o C (Supplementary Fig. 33).</p>
        <p>A slight increase in the pseudo capacitance of the electrodes after the 10 hour stability test can be observed, although the redox feature at 0.80 V does not change appreciably. The increase in pseudocapacitance may be associated with a larger interfacial surface area and/or oxidation of the surface to produce quinone-like redox groups.</p>
        <p>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on the electrodes before and after MEA stability test for 10 h at cell potentials of 0.40, 0.70 and 0.80 V. The EIS was performed at the same potential as the polarisations. EIS was performed using a 5 mV sinusoidal perturbation in the frequency range 10 5 -0.1 Hz using 10 measurement points per decade. EIS shows a marked change both before and after the degradation test with a significant opening up of the low frequency arc, Supplementary Fig. 34. Note that before the MEA test polarization test, the impedance at 0.4V falls between that of 0.7 and 0.8V indicating some mass transfer effects on the low frequency resistance. the Attempts to fit the EIS curves after degradation were poor because of the insufficient low frequency points which could not be obtained because of the instability of the system (EIS requires a stationary system to obtain reasonable results). Nonetheless it is clear from the EIS results that the charge transfer resistance becomes much larger after the long term polarisation indicating that the kinetics become much slower, and the effects are less severe at 0.4 V. There is no significant change to the high frequency intercept indicating that iron leaching from the catalyst layer does not seem to appreciably affect the ionic conductivity of the bulk electrolyte.</p>
        <p>Fe K-edge XANES spectra of Fe-NC Δ-DCDA cathode catalyst in fresh unused MEA and after stability tests at 0.70 and 0.80 V in single cell PEMFC are provided in Supplementary Fig. 35. Also tested was the response of a Nafion membrane left in contact with an acidic solution containing iron acetate. A linear combination fit using the unused MEA and the Fe in Nafion spectra shows that almost half of the iron goes into the membrane (the fit, Supplementary Fig. 34(c)), shows that 45% of iron is in the Nafion and 55% as Fe-N4).</p>
        <p>The Fe-NC Δ-DCDA catalyst was also tested in a 50 cm 2 single cell by Johnson Matthey Fuel Cells and was compared with a commercial Fe-NC from Pajarito Powder. In these tests, the Fe-NC loading was only 1.0 mg cm -2 . A lower loading was used to decrease catalyst layer thickness in order to reduce mass transport limitations at high current densities, an aspect which becomes important under real world conditions associated with lower oxygen stoichiometry operation. The purpose of these tests was to evaluate the performance of our Fe-NC catalyst in an industrial setup and to investigate the performance with cathode thickness comparable to Pt/C layers. For these tests, the catalyst was synthesised in large batch (up to 2 g) and the ink formulation, cathode layer fabrication and test conditions were significantly different from those used for 5 cm 2 single cell tests. The iR-free polarisation curves recorded in oxygen and air environments are shown in Supplementary Fig. 36.</p>
        <p>Compared to the commercial catalyst, Fe-NC Δ-DCDA exhibits significantly higher fuel cell voltages at all current densities under both oxygen and air indicating its superior ORR activity. However, a significantly larger HFR was observed for Fe-NC Δ-DCDA based MEA (Supplementary Fig. 37). While the reasons for high HFR in large size PEMFC tests are not yet fully clear, we suspect that this could be due to a number of different factors including absence of Vulcan XC72 in the cathode layer which was used in 5 cm 2 cell to improve conductivity, dissolution of residual Zn (as an earlier scaled-up batch of Fe-NC Δ-DCDA catalyst with somewhat higher residual Zn (4-5 wt%) was used for large size single cell tests), or MEA preparation method. Decal transfer method was used by Johnson Matthey Fuel Cells to make 50 cm 2 MEAs and observed a similar high HFR issue for MEAs made by the same process but using a different scaled up Fe-NC catalyst developed in this project (data not shown here). It is unclear what is causing this, but it may be some process-related factor(s) rather than the catalyst.</p>
        <p>Supplementary Fig. 36. Fuel cell tests using Fe-NC Δ-DCDA and Pajarito commercial Fe-NC catalysts in a 50 cm 2 single cell. The MEAs were prepared by decal transfer method. Test conditions: anode: 20 % Pt/ XC72R with 0.1 mgPt cm -2 loading; cathode: Fe-NC Δ-DCDA or commercial Pajarito Fe-NC with 1.0 mg cm -2 loading; PFSA reinforced Gore Back Up Power membrane (15 µm thickness), cell temperature = 80 o C; 100% RH at both electrodes; Stoichiometric flow rates of anode (s = 2 for H2) and cathode (s = 9.5 for O2 and s = 2 for air) reactants were used at current densities &gt;0.2 A cm -2 and constant flows (corresponding to 0.2 A cm -2 stoichiometric flows) at current densities &lt;0.2 A cm -2 ; 1.7 bar gauge inlet pressure at both electrodes.</p>
