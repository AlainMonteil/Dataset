        <p>xisting American Heart Association cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines do not address the challenges of providing resuscitation in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, wherein rescuers must continuously balance the immediate needs of the patients with their own safety. To address this gap, the American Heart Association, in collaboration with the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association for Respiratory Care, American College of Emergency Physicians, The Society of Critical Care Anesthesiologists, and American Society of Anesthesiologists, and with the support of the American Association of Critical Care Nurses and National Association of EMS Physicians, has compiled interim guidance to help rescuers treat individuals with cardiac arrest with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.</p>
        <p>Over the past 2 decades, there has been a steady improvement in survival after cardiac arrest occurring both inside and outside the hospital. 1 That success has relied on initiating proven resuscitation interventions such as high-quality chest compressions and defibrillation within seconds to minutes. The evolving and expanding outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections has created important challenges to such resuscitation efforts and requires potential modifications of established processes and practices. The challenge is to ensure that patients with or without COVID-19 who experience cardiac arrest get the best possible chance of survival without compromising the safety of rescuers, who will be needed to care for future patients. Complicating the emergency response to both out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest is that COVID-19 is highly transmissible, particularly during resuscitation, and carries a high morbidity and mortality.</p>
        <p>Approximately 12% to 19% of COVID-positive patients require hospital admission, and 3% to 6% become critically ill. [2][3][4] Hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial injury, ventricular arrhythmias, and shock are common among critically ill patients and predispose them to cardiac arrest, [5][6][7][8] as do some of the proposed treatments such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which can prolong the QT. 9 With infections currently growing exponentially in the United States and internationally, the percentage of patients with cardiac arrests and COVID-19 is likely to increase.</p>
        <p>Healthcare workers are already the highest-risk profession for contracting the disease. 10 This risk is compounded by worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Resuscitations carry added risk to healthcare workers for many reasons. First, the administration of CPR involves performing numerous aerosol-generating procedures, including chest compressions, positive-pressure ventilation, and establishment of an advanced airway. During those procedures, viral particles can remain suspended in the air with a half-life of ≈1 hour and</p>
        <p>e934 be inhaled by those nearby. 11 Second, resuscitation efforts require numerous providers to work in close proximity to one another and the patient. Finally, these are high-stress emergency events in which the immediate needs of the patient requiring resuscitation may result in lapses in infection-control practices.</p>
        <p>In arriving at this interim guidance, we reviewed existing American Heart Association CPR recommendations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and considered the unique pathophysiology of COVID-19 with reversal of hypoxemia as a central goal. We sought to balance the competing interests of providing timely and high-quality resuscitation to patients and simultaneously protecting rescuers. This statement applies to all adult, pediatric, and neonatal resuscitations in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection unless otherwise noted. The guidance contained herein is based on expert opinion and needs to be adapted locally on the basis of current disease burden and resource availability.</p>
        <p>Reduce Provider Exposure to COVID-19 Rationale It is essential that providers protect themselves and their colleagues from unnecessary exposure. Exposed providers who contract COVID-19 further decrease the already strained workforce available to respond and have the potential to add additional strain if they become critically ill.</p>
        <p>1. Before entering the scene, all rescuers should don PPE to guard against contact with both airborne and droplet particles. Consult individual health or emergency medical services (EMS) system standards because PPE recommendations may vary considerably on the basis of current epidemiological data and availability. 2. Limit personnel in the room or on the scene to only those essential for patient care. 3. In settings with protocols in place and expertise in their use, consider replacing manual chest compressions with mechanical CPR devices to reduce the number of rescuers required for adults and adolescents who meet the manufacturer's height and weight criteria. 4. Clearly communicate COVID-19 status to any new providers before their arrival on the scene or receipt of the patient when transferring to a second setting.</p>
        <p>Although the procedure of intubation carries a high risk of aerosolization, if the patient is intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube and connected to a ventilator with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter in the path of exhaled gas and an inline suction catheter, the resulting closed circuit carries a lower risk of aerosolization than any other form of positive-pressure ventilation.</p>
        <p>• CPR is a high-intensity team effort that diverts rescuer attention away from other patients. 13 In the context of COVID-19, the risk to the clinical team is increased and resources can be profoundly more limited, particularly in regions that are experiencing a high burden of disease. Although the outcomes for cardiac arrest in COVID-19 are still unknown, the mortality for critically ill patients with COVID-19</p>

        <p>is high and rises with increasing age and comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease. 2,[5][6][7][8] Therefore, it is reasonable to consider age, comorbidities, and severity of illness in determining the appropriateness of resuscitation and to balance the likelihood of success against the risk to rescuers and patients from whom resources are being diverted.</p>
        <p>Below are specific considerations for cardiac arrest in individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 occurring outside of the hospital. Depending on local e936</p>
        <p>prevalence and evidence of community spread, COV-ID-19 may be suspected in some out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.</p>
        <p>Bystander CPR has consistently been shown to improve the likelihood of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which decreases with every minute that CPR and defibrillation are delayed. [15][16][17] Rescuers in the community are unlikely to have access to adequate PPE and therefore may be at increased risk of exposure to COVID-19 during CPR compared with healthcare providers adequate PPE. Rescuers with increasing age and the presence of comorbid conditions such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic lung disease 4 are at increased risk of becoming critically ill if infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, when the cardiac arrest occurs at home (as has been reported in 70% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests 17 before the recent widespread shelter-at-home ordinances), lay rescuers are likely to have already been exposed to COVID-19. • For children: Lay rescuers should perform chest compressions and consider mouth-to-mouth ventilation, if willing and able, given the higher incidence of respiratory arrest in children, 17 especially if they are household members who have been exposed to the patient at home. A face mask or cloth covering the mouth and nose of the rescuer and/or patient may reduce the risk of transmission to a nonhousehold bystander if unable or unwilling to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation.</p>
        <p>• Because defibrillation is not expected to be a highly aerosolizing procedure, lay rescuers should use an automated external defibrillator, if available, to assess and treat patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. the field, consider not transferring to hospital given the low likelihood of survival for the patient, 17 balanced against the added risk of additional exposure to prehospital and hospital providers.</p>
        <p>Below are specific considerations for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the hospital setting. These interim guidelines do not apply to patients who are known to be COVID-19 negative. Those patients should receive standard basic and advanced life support. However, it may be reasonable to reduce the number of personnel in the room for all resuscitations during the pandemic for social distancing purposes.</p>
        <p>• Address advanced care directives and goals of care with all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (or proxy) on hospital arrival and with any significant change in clinical status such as an increase in level of care. • Closely monitor for signs and symptoms of clinical deterioration to minimize the need for emergency intubations that put patients and providers at higher risk. • If the patient is at risk for cardiac arrest, consider proactively moving the patient to a negative-pressure room/unit, if available, to minimize risk of exposure to rescuers during a resuscitation. • Close the door when possible to prevent airborne contamination of adjacent indoor space.</p>
        <p>• Consider leaving the patient on a mechanical ventilator with a HEPA filter to maintain a closed circuit and to reduce aerosolization.</p>
        <p>ing into account patient risk factors to estimate the likelihood of survival. Risk stratification and policies should be communicated to patients (or proxy) during discussions of goals of care. 14. There are insufficient data to support extracorporeal CPR for patients with COVID-19.</p>
