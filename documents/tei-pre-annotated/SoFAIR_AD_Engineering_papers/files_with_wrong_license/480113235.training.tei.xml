        <p>Quantum metrology is one of the most promising applications of quantum technologies. The aim of this research field is the estimation of unknown parameters exploiting quantum resources, whose application can lead to enhanced performances with respect to classical strategies. Several physical quantum systems can be employed to develop quantum sensors, and photonic systems represent ideal probes for a large number of metrological tasks. Here, the authors review the basic concepts behind quantum metrology and then focus on the application of photonic technology for this task, with particular attention to phase estimation. The authors describe the current state of the art in the field in terms of platforms and quantum resources. Furthermore, the authors present the research area of multiparameter quantum metrology, where multiple parameters have to be estimated at the same time. The authors conclude by discussing the current experimental and theoretical challenges and the open questions toward implementation of photonic quantum sensors with quantum-enhanced performances in the presence of noise.Quantum metrology is one of the most promising applications of quantum technologies.

        <p>One of the basic pillars of physical science is the measurement process. The goal of a measure is to associate a value with a physical quantity, giving an estimate of it. Together with each experimental estimate, an uncertainty has to be provided, that is, the "parameter, associated with the result of a measurement that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measured quantity" [definition from ISO (Ref. 1)]. The statistical error, which affects the measurement result, can have different natures: technical or fundamental. The technical one is mostly represented by the accidental error, due to out-of-control imperfections in the measurement process. Conversely, there are fundamental limits on uncertainty, such as those due to Heisenberg relations, that are imposed by physical laws. Quantum mechanics is the most successful, predictive, and fundamental theory describing small scale phenomena. For this reason, a study of the measurement process and the ultimate achievable precision bounds has to be done under the light of such theory. 2,3 On the one hand, quantum mechanics imposes fundamental limits on the estimate precision. On the other hand, in order to achieve such limits, quantum resources have to be employed.One of the basic pillars of physical science is the measurement process.

        <p>A key role of quantum enhancement in estimation theory is played by entanglement. This quantum phenomena is one of the most striking aspects of quantum mechanics and radically differs from the classical view of the world, as recognized by Einstein et al. 34 The relevance of entanglement in the fundamental divergence between classical and quantum predictions was theoretically demonstrated by Bell. 35 Realizing his famous test, recent experiments showed, in a nearly unambiguous way, that the observed quantum correlations arising from distant entangled systems cannot be explained by any classical theory obeying local causality. [36][37][38][39] Quantum correlations also represent an extraordinary resource allowing to enhance performances in informational tasks. [40][41][42][43] Quantum advantage with respect to the best classical strategies lies at the basis of the research area of quantum technologies, comprising branches such as quantum computation, communication, simulation, and precision metrology. 41 Besides the fundamental interest about ultimate precision limits, quantum metrology presents different applications.

In particular in optical phase estimation, the phase shift is a difference between optical paths that can be estimated through interferometers. One of the most common and simple two-mode optical interferometers, suitable for phase estimation, is the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). 259,260 The two key elements of a MZI are the phase shifter (PS) and the beam splitter (BS).

        <p>Quantum information can be encoded in photonic states by exploiting different degrees of freedom. A first possibility is provided by the polarization, or spin angular momentum (SAM), that can encode two-dimensional quantum states spanned by the orthonormal basis of horizontal and vertical polarizations fjHi; jVig. 279 The interaction between polarized light and matter allows the manipulation of the polarization through linear optical elements like waveplates. These are birefringent materials that introduce a phase delay between the two orthogonal polarizations. Any unitary transformation in the twodimensional Hilbert space of polarization can be realized by a suitable sequence of waveplates. Projection in polarization space can be realized through a polarizing beam splitter, that spatially separates orthogonal polarizations. 279 Polarization is then a largely used encoding for quantum information protocols and is also often coupled with other degrees of freedom. 185 Besides SAM, angular momentum of light is also composed of another contribution carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) that is related to light spatial distribution. 280,281 SAM and OAM can be considered separately in the paraxial limit and are exploited as independent carriers of quantum states. OAM can be described conveniently by Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes, carrying, in a single photon regime, a quantized amount of angular momentum m h, where m 2 Z indicates the azimuthal phase structure of the beam. Thanks to the unbounded Hilbert space in which OAM lives, which is spanned by the basis of optical vortexes jLG m i, states of arbitrary discrete dimensions (qudits) can be realized. [282][283][284][285][286][287] Generation and manipulation of OAM modes can be performed by means of different devices. Two of the most important techniques are: q-plate (QP) and spatial light modulator (SLM). A QP is an inhomogeneous anisotropic material that, based on light polarization, changes the OAM state: jLijLG m i À! QP jRijLG mþ2q i and jRijLG m i À! QP jLijLG mÀ2q i, where jRi (jLi) is the right (left) circularly polarized state, and q 2 Z represents the topological charge of the QP. [288][289][290][291] Such devices, naturally entangle OAM and polarization degrees of freedom, thus are capable of generating vector-vortex beams. [292][293][294][295][296] The latter are a class of states with several applications in quantum information, and very recently, the possibility of fiber propagation has been also demonstrated. 297 Conversely, a SLM can induce directly phase and intensity changes on the optical beam in correspondence of each pixel. 298,299 An SLM, followed by coupling in single mode fibers, can be exploited to measure different OAM modes. 283,[300][301][302][303] Other methods different from QP and SLM can be exploited to manipulate and measure OAM states, as shown in Refs. 304-310. Time-bin [311][312][313] and time-frequency [314][315][316][317] degrees of freedom can be also exploited as quantum resources. For such encodings, photon manipulation can be done through interferometric schemes. 185 In parallel, field quadratures, amplitude and phase-squeezing, can suitably encode continuous variable states. 33,318,319 In the context of quantum metrology, one of the most widely adopted photonic degrees of freedom for quantum metrology is path encoding. The latter corresponds to a set of spatial modes occupied by the photons. 7,8,279 In this framework, the two elements that allow a complete manipulation of single photons in spatial modes are the beam splitter and the phase shifter. 279 Through these devices, interferometric setups, that are at the basis of most quantum metrology tasks, can be realized (see Sec.

        <p>Conversely, another approach is to employ, as probes, states that are much easier to generate compared to N00N states. For this purpose, even classical states can be employed, given their greater robustness against losses. From such states, one can finally recover N00N typical super-resolution, through suitable state projections that discard all the undesired terms of Eq.

Indeed, such a technique does not require photons to be detected all at the same point. 441,442 A clever way to generate N00N-like states is to let a coherent state interfere with the state generated by a SPDC process 260,443 (Fig. 5). Such a scheme was experimentally realized, in the polarization degree of freedom, to perform imaging with N ¼ 2, 3 110 and allowed to generate (in a post-selected configuration) N00N states with up to N ¼ 5 photons. 440,444,445 States showing super-resolution with photon number N ¼ 6 were demonstrated through a coherent probe state and suitable stateprojection measurements along N00N states in a time-reversal configuration. 234 The probe state interacting with the system and embedding the phase is a classical one. Hence, even with ideal optical elements, SQL cannot be unconditionally beaten. Such a scheme was also used to perform imaging through a polarization state of N ¼ 2, 3 photons. 446 A class of N00N-like states, where photons are distributed along different modes (for example N photons along N spatial modes maximally entangled in the polarization degree of freedom), are called Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. 447 Such states were realized with up to 10 spatially separated photons entangled in the polarization degree of freedom (with an experimentally observed super-resolution up to N ¼ 8), 448 with up to 10 qubits encoded in two degrees of freedom (polarization and path) of five spatially separated photons (with a super-resolution shown for N ¼ 8 qubits), 449 and with up to 18 qubits encoded in three degrees of freedom (polarization, path and OAM) of six spatially separated photons. 450 GHZ states were also exploited for noisy phase estimations.

Furthermore, detectors are affected by photon-counting noise (or shot-noise), which follows the Poisson statistics. Therefore, improving signal-to-shot noise ratio (SNR) requires increasing the number of input photons. In contrast, thermal mirror displacement is proportional to the input laser power. Quantum metrological techniques, such as those adopting squeezing resource as the input state in the interferometer, 577 seem to be the only possible short-term solution, able to reduce the quantum noise contributes without increasing the laser power. In particular, an interferometer-based detection depends on the optical path difference between internal arms. Entanglement in the probe state can correlate both noise and signal between internal arms in a way that noise is cancel out, thus enhancing the SNR. For example, if a coherent state is overlapped with a vacuum squeezed state into the input beam splitter of a Michelson interferometer, correlation after this interference permits squeezing in the output state and the improvement of the SNR. 30 In particular, the higher the squeezing factor, the greater the SNR enhancement. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that strong squeezing could lead to approximately tenfold improvement in gravitational wave detection. 30 Furthermore, the capability of reducing the quantum noise in gravitational wave interferometers depends on the frequency which has to be detected. 578 Frequency-dependent squeezing schemes can be used to reduce quantum noise in the audio-band spectrum, and an EPR entangled squeezing-based setup has been proposed to achieve a broadband solution.

Indeed, it has been demonstrated that strong squeezing could lead to approximately tenfold improvement in gravitational wave detection. 30 Furthermore, the capability of reducing the quantum noise in gravitational wave interferometers depends on the frequency which has to be detected. 578 Frequency-dependent squeezing schemes can be used to reduce quantum noise in the audio-band spectrum, and an EPR entangled squeezing-based setup has been proposed to achieve a broadband solution. [579][580][581] One of these proposals has been recently realized in Refs. 582 and 583. Different studies have investigated the fundamental limits achievable in these interferometers and schemes to evade radiation pressure. [584][585][586][587][588][589][590] Starting from 2007, the GEO600 gravitational wave detector has successfully adopted squeezed light for its detection. 46,591 Recently, after preliminary tests, 592 squeezed vacuum states have been used in the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors. 593,594 Other gravitational wave detectors have almost achieved best technological performances in their several components 571,[595][596][597] and seem to find further improvements only in squeezing enhancement.</p>
        <p>The conceptual scheme of the LIGO Michelson interferometer, seeded by squeezed states, is sketched in Fig. 6. The 4 km-long arms of FIG. 6. Conceptual scheme of LIGO interferometer seeded by squeezed states. Squeezed states are injected in the interferometer by means of Faraday isolators, allowing light to pass along only specific directions. (a) A single mode squeezed state jni, generated by an OPO, is injected in the Michelson interferometer. (b) A two-mode squeezed state jni 2 is generated by two squeezed states interfering in a BS. Then, one mode of jni 2 is injected in the interferometer, while the other mode interferes with the output of the interferometer in a beam splitter (BS). Described in Ref. 26. the interferometer contain Fabry-Perot cavities composed of two mirrors that reflect the light forcing it to travel across the arms multiple times, so enlarging the effective length of the arms and, consequently, the sensitivity of the interferometer. Recycling power mirrors are used to increase the optical intensity inside the interferometer. When single squeezed states are used to enhance the sensitivity, they are injected in the input of the interferometer [Fig. 6(a)]. Also a two-mode squeezed state can be exploited to enhance the detection. In this case, the two squeezed fields, with a fixed relative angle, interfere in a beam splitter generating a two-mode entangled state. One mode is injected in the interferometer, while the other interferes with the output of the interferometer in a second beam splitter. Finally, a homodyne measurement of the quadratures is performed [Fig. 6(b)]. Thanks to the simultaneous measurement of the quadratures, the possible disturbance signals can be recognized with respect to the signal to be analyzed. 598 Note that squeezed states can enhance the performances of gravitational wave detection, but they only represent a useful complement to classical resources. Indeed, the overwhelming majority contribution in the employed number of photons comes from coherent light, and then, even if an enhancement over SQL can be obtained, the sensitivity is still far from Heisenberg limit.The conceptual scheme of the LIGO Michelson interferometer, seeded by squeezed states, is sketched in Fig. 6.

This has been experimentally demonstrated with photonic platforms in Refs. 632-634. Quantum enhanced sensitivities can be also obtained in SU(1,1) interferometers, in which the linear optical beam splitters (BS) are replaced by nonlinear active optical interactions. 265,[638][639][640][641][642] These include parametric amplifiers based on FWM processes 643 or parametric down conversion 644 that generate useful entanglement inside the interferometer. These platforms are robust against noises, thus guaranteeing quantum enhanced performances also in the presence of losses. [645][646][647][648][649] General nonlinear effects in estimation strategies can lead to scalings beyond the Heisenberg limit. 229,[650][651][652] Different photonic techniques exploiting quantum states for imaging have been reported. 21 For instance, spatial correlations between photons can be exploited for ghost imaging. 27,[653][654][655][656][657][658][659] In this case, two correlated photons, such as those belonging to pairs generated by a SPDC process, are employed to probe a sample with the goal of reconstructing its image. One of the photons propagates through the sample, and is measured by a photodetector without spatial resolution. Conversely, the other photon does not interact with the sample and is measured by the spatial resolving detector. The image of the object is reconstructed by the combined information from the two correlated photons: the spatial information comes from detecting the photon that did not interact with the sample, and is triggered by detection of the photon that interacted with it. Hence, by exploiting the spatial correlation of the photons, one can recover spatial information on the object. This is obtained by spatially resolving only the photon that did not interact with the object and discarding the spatial information obtained from detection of the interacting photon. Quantum ghost imaging has been realized exploiting different techniques for the spatial resolving measurement stage. 346,347,[660][661][662] The key ingredient of ghost imaging is the correlation between the two photons (or beams). Hence, also classical correlated light can be used for this purpose. [663][664][665][666] However, in the low probe intensity regime, quantum probes can provide better performances. 104,654,667,668 Quantum ghost imaging has also been realized to perform 3D tomography, 669 and in a configuration exploiting entanglement swapping. 670 Imaging on samples with a pair of photons can be performed even without detecting the photons interacting with the sample. 348,671 This technique exploits two identical nonlinear crystals pumped by two laser beams coming from the same split laser. The pumped crystals emit pairs of nondegenerate photons, signal and idler. The idler photon from one crystal, once separated from the signal one, interacts with the sample and is subsequently sent along the second nonlinear crystal. The latter element is also pumped by the laser and then can emit pairs of photons as well. In this way, there are two different paths for the signal photons, which are then sent to interfere in a beam splitter. Information is acquired from quantum interference between the two signal beams that did not interact with the object. Hence, one can perform phase and intensity imaging without measuring those photons, which have interacted with the object. An experimental demonstration of such a protocol has been demonstrated in Ref. 348. Finally, quantum mechanics allows acquiring information about an object without any system directly interacting with it. This is possible through interaction-free measurements.

[687][688][689][690] In this protocol, two entangled beams are generated, and one of the two beams is sent through a partially reflective object (sample). The reflected beam is finally jointly measured with the other beam who did not interact with the sample. Hence, exploiting the correlation between the beams one can recover the reflected light from the object, discriminating it from background noise. For this purpose, a two-mode squeezed vacuum state is nearly optimal for different performance criteria. 691 Experimental realizations of quantum illumination were performed using parametric down conversion beams detected by the CCD camera 692 and using microwave frequency beams. 693 The quantum enhancement of such scheme resists also in strongly noisy environments. 134,687,688,694,695 Finally, quantum interferometry can be realized also in the timeenergy domain of photons, exploiting Franson interferometers.

[687][688][689][690] In this protocol, two entangled beams are generated, and one of the two beams is sent through a partially reflective object (sample). The reflected beam is finally jointly measured with the other beam who did not interact with the sample. Hence, exploiting the correlation between the beams one can recover the reflected light from the object, discriminating it from background noise. For this purpose, a two-mode squeezed vacuum state is nearly optimal for different performance criteria. 691 Experimental realizations of quantum illumination were performed using parametric down conversion beams detected by the CCD camera 692 and using microwave frequency beams. 693 The quantum enhancement of such scheme resists also in strongly noisy environments. 134,687,688,694,695 Finally, quantum interferometry can be realized also in the timeenergy domain of photons, exploiting Franson interferometers.

        <p>Exploiting adaptive protocols for quantum metrology was proposed in 1995 by Wiseman. 709 Such protocols are necessary in order to overcome different issues. For instance, they can be used for the realization of the optimal POVM to saturate the QCRB. In certain scenarios, such POVMs can be hard or impossible to implement. In this case, approximation of such measurements can be achieved by adaptive techniques. 215,711 In particular, to approach the QCRB one has to maximize the Fisher Information of a given setup. However, the latter quantity depends in general on the unknown parameter. More specifically, given an initial probe, the QCRB is attainable only when the unknown parameter takes a value, which maximizes the Fisher Information. Nevertheless, it can be demonstrated that, even with no prior knowledge on the unknown parameter, the QCRB can be asymptotically saturated by exploiting adaptive techniques. 716 A second scenario where an adaptive approach represents a useful resource is found for those systems where the output probabilities, calculated at different values of unknown parameter, take the same value. For instance, in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer seeded by single photons, the output probability (P 1 ¼ 1 À P 0 ¼ cos 2 /=2) is such that, in the range / 2 ½0; 2p, two different values of the phases lead to the same probability P 1 6 ¼ 0. Indeed, the latter is not a monotonic function of the phase. Hence, without changing the relative phase shift during the experiment, it is impossible to discern the two equivalent phases leading to the same probability. Conversely, by changing the total phase shift during the estimation process, for instance through another known control phase, it is possible to solve such issues. In any case, when the output probabilities are periodic with a period less than 2p, it is impossible to distinguish some phases. In such cases, one could employ an adaptive protocol where the probe state can change at each iteration, thus changing the likelihood function and its periodicity. For instance, during the first steps one can employ probes whose likelihood has no periodicity, in order to restrict the range of possible unknown phase values. When the range is sufficiently small, more sensible states with smaller periodicity can be used. 409 However, the validity of such recipe depends on the problem symmetries.Exploiting adaptive protocols for quantum metrology was proposed in 1995 by Wiseman. 709 Such protocols are necessary in order to overcome different issues.

In the single-parameter case, theorems guarantee that it is always possible to define suitable measurements and estimators, allowing to reach the minimum error achievable with a given probe state (see Sec. II C). However, this capability of reaching the ultimate bounds is guaranteed only in the asymptotic regime.

        <p>• Online schemes: At each step of the estimation protocol, the feedback is calculated according to the previous measurement result and a heuristic. An important class of these schemes is represented by Bayesian adaptive protocols. Here, at each step of the protocol, the posterior probability evolves based on measurement results. In this way, the posterior is used to calculate the optimal feedback action to be applied at next step. Note that optimality is defined depending on the particular problem and heuristic. • Offline schemes: The feedback values used during the experiments are computed before the estimation process. The goal is then the optimization of such sequence of feedback values. Different optimization techniques based on trial and error approaches can be exploited, such as those based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 732,733 and Differential Evolution (DE). [734][735][736] Finally, adaptive protocols can also be exploited to enhance state discrimination and more general in quantum tomography.

        <p>One of the first adaptive phase estimations, providing an experimental demonstration of the proposal in Ref. 709, was realized exploiting adaptive homodyne phase measurements on coherent states. 746 Coherent states with homodyne measurements were also employed for adaptive estimation of a continuously varying phase, beating the nonadaptive filtering limit. 747 HL scaling, in this kind of schemes, cannot be achieved by employing coherent states as probes. However, an enhancement of a constant factor with respect to SQL can be obtained. FIG. 7. Conceptual scheme of an adaptive estimation protocol. The cycle of a general adaptive estimation protocol starts from an initial state q in that is prepared (blue box) in a state q 0 ðhÞ through the action of U h . Such state interacts with the unknown parameter / (brown box), and then the output state q fin ðh; /Þ undergoes an appropriately chosen measurement P x (gray box). After such measurement, the results X are exploited to define a suitable action U h ðXÞ (orange box), employed to prepare the initial state of the next probe. In this way, the cycle is repeated for all the probes. At the end of the process, an estimator provides the final estimate of h. Also coherent state discrimination can be performed through adaptive schemes. 748 When employing quantum states, one can reach improved scaling in the estimation process. In this regime, when the phase to be estimated is completely unknown (flat prior distribution), adaptive techniques can be employed. 198,749 This is the goal of an ab initio quantum phase estimation experiment that was experimentally realized by Ref. 604 using HB states. In such realization, a sequence of different states is used. In particular, single-, two-, and four-photon HB states in the polarization degree of freedom were generated through a type-I SPDC process followed by interference in a polarizing beam splitter. These output states were detected by a probabilistic photon-number resolving detection. The employed Bayesian protocol is composed of a first step with random feedback. Subsequently, after the measurement of a group of singlephoton events, the posterior probability is updated and the next feedback is calculated by optimizing the expected sharpness function [Eq. ( 12)] over the possible results of the next measurements. Using suitable sequences of states (with photon numbers N ¼ 1, 2, and 4), the SQL was surpassed. 604 The SQL can be overcome by employing other classes of states, such as Gaussian squeezed states with squeezing parameter r that reach a value for the variance 482,750 equal to V ¼ 1=½2Nsinhð2rÞ. Since for this resource state the optimal Fisher Information depends on the unknown phase, an adaptive protocol has to be employed, and Bayesian estimation can be exploited for this purpose. Given this class of input states, a Bayesian protocol for ab initio phase estimation has been experimentally realized using squeezed states and homodyne detection, together with real-time feedback. 751 The phase of a squeezed state is measured with respect to a local oscillator through homodyne detection. More specifically, a first set of data is exploited to perform a rough estimation of the phase. Then, the local oscillator phase is adjusted to the value that leads to the minimum error in the estimation process. 751 Finally, also two mode squeezed states can be exploited in adaptive protocols. 752 Bayesian adaptive estimation can be used to reach the HL with single photons in a multipass configuration without the need for entanglement as demonstrated in Ref. 233. In this case, single photons are employed for a multipass polarization interferometer estimating phases through a generalized Kitaev's algorithm. 753 An adaptive hybrid approach, exploiting simultaneously polarization entangled two-photon states and a multipass configuration (with N ¼ 3 passes per state, two for one photon and one for the other), achieved within 4% the exact value of HL at a finite number of resources. 754 This implementation demonstrated the theoretical proposal of Ref. 711.

In particular, after a random initialization of candidate policies, at each iteration of the algorithm new polices are generated by combining randomly chosen policies. The policies with highest fitness values are then selected for the next step. This procedure is iterated until a halting condition for the fitness of the best policy is reached.

        <p>All photons along the two modes are recombined in a single spatial mode through a polarizing beam splitter. After its preparation, the four-photon HB state passes through the unitary evolution, performed by three cascaded waveplates, and is finally measured by a polarization selection stage and probabilistic photon-number resolving detection [Fig. 9(d)]. The probabilities are estimated from data through a maximum-likelihood technique and a quantum enhancement is observed in the estimation of random unitaries, considering the fourphoton detected events as the employed resources. 910 In measurements of squeezed light, scattering of photons from the meter can cause parastic signal, called parasitic interference. 974,975 This affects also measurements of gravitational waves, limiting the possible quantum advantages. 571 The authors in Ref. 598 theoretically and experimentally demonstrated the concept of quantum dense metrology. In this scheme, a two-mode squeezed state is exploited in order to identify the parasitic noise and discard the corrupted data recovering quantum advantage. The setup is the same represented in Fig. 6(b). To this end, both the quadratures are simultaneously estimated beyond the SQL. The quantum dense metrology technique was applied also in modified protocols able to enhance the reduction of noises. 913 In Table III we report some of the photonic platforms employed to perform multiparameter estimations with quantum strategies.All photons along the two modes are recombined in a single spatial mode through a polarizing beam splitter.

        <p>In this review, we provided an overview of the current state of the art in photonic technologies for quantum metrology applications. In particular, starting from the theoretical fundamental ingredients, we have discussed the most commonly adopted strategies and platforms for photonic systems, with particular attention toward application of adaptive strategies for efficient extraction of information. Finally, we have provided an overview of the recently expanding field of multiparameter estimation, which has potential applications in a large variety of fields where the process inherently involves multiple physical quantities at once.In this review, we provided an overview of the current state of the art in photonic technologies for quantum metrology applications.

        <p>Several open points, both from a theoretical and experimental point of view, still have to be addressed toward development of photonic quantum sensors capable of providing quantum enhancement in realistic noisy conditions. 191,452,701,954,956,[976][977][978][979] For photonic systems, the main challenges are represented by losses within the apparatus. Theoretical studies 11,949,950,953,957 have indeed shown the detrimental effect of losses toward reaching sub-SQL performances, in particular, when the number of involved photons N in the prepared probes is large. Indeed, no quantum enhancement (in terms of scaling in N) can be achieved when losses are large enough, leaving space only for a constant improvement in this regime. All these results lead to a large effort toward development of appropriate metrological strategies capable of providing a more robust behavior in a noisy and lossy scenario. 708,947,952,967,[980][981][982][983][984][985][986][987][988][989][990][991] In parallel, experimental effort has been devoted to achieving technological advances in photonic systems. Such effort has enabled the first recent experimental demonstration of unconditional violation of the SQL in a two-photon experiment. 400 In this direction, a significant amount of work still has to be done to improve the performances of photonic platforms to obtain quantumenhancement in more complex scenarios. To this end, a significant intermediate step before reaching an unconditional violation of the SQL for larger sensors would be to obtain improved performances with respect to classical strategies, by comparing the achieved sensitivities in the presence of the same noise conditions. Note that, in the presence of noise, entangled estimation protocols employing external ancillas can lead to a higher sensitivity than the one achievable by using sequential unentangled estimations. 701,705,706,992 In this sense, noisy cases are those where quantum advantage becomes evident. 12 A second promising research direction can be found in the multiparameter scenario, which has recently received growing attention for its wide range of applications. 18,20 Additionally, recent studies have shown that a multiparameter approach can provide some advantages in the presence of noise. 894,903 While the last few years have reported significant advances in the field, both in terms of theoretical background and of technological platforms, there are still several open points. Indeed, general recipes for the definition of optimal probe states for a general multiparameter scenario are still lacking. A similar issue is present for the definition of the optimal measurement strategies, in particular in the presence of noise which inherently requires considering mixed probe states. Finally, minimally invasive scenarios such as those involving biological systems 993 require the development of quantum strategies tailored to obtain optimal performances when only limited data are available. 717,994 AUTHORS' CONTRIBUTIONS E.P. and M.V. contributed equally to this work.Several open points, both from a theoretical and experimental point of view, still have to be addressed toward development of photonic quantum sensors capable of providing quantum enhancement in realistic noisy conditions. 191,452,701,954,956,[976][977][978][979] For photonic systems, the main challenges are represented by losses within the apparatus.
