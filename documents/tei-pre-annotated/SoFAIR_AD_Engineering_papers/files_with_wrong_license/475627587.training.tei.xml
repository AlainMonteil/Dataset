In the absence of an ILCOR recommendation, ERC-ESICM guidance was based on review and discussion of the evidence by the working group until consensus was achieved. The writing group chairs ensured that everyone on the working group had the opportunity to present and debate their views and ensured that discussions were open and constructive. All discussions took place during eight 2-h Zoom videoconferences that were held between January 2020 and November 2020. Consensus was achieved by all 15 writing group members on all the treatment recommendations using an open process.These ERC-ESICM guidelines on post-resuscitation care for adults are based mainly on the Advanced Life Support section of the 2020 CoSTR document and represent consensus among the writing group, which included representatives of the ERC and the ESICM. 9 Where treatment recommendations are provided by ILCOR, these have been adopted by the ERC and ESICM.

        <p>The prognostication strategy algorithm is applicable to all patients who remain comatose with an absent or extensor motor response to pain at !72 There has a very large amount of data published on prognostication since the 2015 guidelines. A recent systematic review identified 94 studies that included over 30,000 patients, all published since January 2013. 15 The two-stage prognostication algorithm in the 2015 guidelines has been simplified so that a poor outcome is considered likely when two or more of the listed predictors are present. The algorithm is valid for comatose patients with a Glasgow Motor Score 3 (compared with 2 in the 2015 version). A threshold value for NSE is now stated. The EEG patterns suppression and burst-suppression are the most consistent predictors of poor neurological outcome. Conversely, absence of EEG reactivity has been only inconsistently associated with poor neurological outcome in recent studies. We suggest using the 2021 ACNS terminology when assessing these patterns for prognostication, to ensure an unequivocal identification.The prognostication strategy algorithm is applicable to all patients who remain comatose with an absent or extensor motor response to pain at !72 There has a very large amount of data published on prognostication since the 2015 guidelines.

        <p>The post-cardiac arrest syndrome comprises post-cardiac arrest hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction, the systemic ischaemia/reperfusion response, and the persistent precipitating pathology. 18À21 The severity of this syndrome will vary with the duration and cause of cardiac arrest. It may not occur at all if the cardiac arrest is brief. Among patients surviving to intensive care unit (ICU) admission but subsequently dying in-hospital, withdrawal of treatment following prognostication of poor neurological outcome is the cause of death in approximately two-thirds after OHCA and approximately 25% after in-hospital cardiac arrest. 22À26 Cardiovascular failure accounts for most deaths in the first three days, while, in many countries, WLST based on a prognostication of severe hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury accounts for most of the later deaths. 23,26,27 Post-cardiac arrest hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury is associated with hypotension, hypoxaemia, hyperoxaemia, pyrexia, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and seizures. Significant myocardial dysfunction is common after cardiac arrest but typically starts to recover by 2À3 days, although full recovery may take significantly longer. 28À33 The whole-body ischaemia/reperfusion of cardiac arrest, CPR and ROSC activates immune and coagulation pathways contributing to multiple organ failure and increasing the risk of infection. 34À43 Thus, the post-cardiac arrest syndrome has many features in common with sepsis, including intravascular volume depletion, vasodilation, endothelial injury and abnormalities of the microcirculation. 44À53The post-cardiac arrest syndrome comprises post-cardiac arrest hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction, the systemic ischaemia/reperfusion response, and the persistent precipitating pathology. 18À21 The severity of this syndrome will vary with the duration and cause of cardiac arrest.

        <p>In most post-cardiac arrest patients, controlled oxygenation will require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for at least 24À72 h. The exception being the completely conscious patient with a patent airway who should be treated with an oxygen mask or noninvasive ventilation targeting a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) of 94À98%. During cardiac arrest, patients' lungs are ventilated with the maximum feasible inspired oxygen, which is usually 100% during advanced resuscitation. 9 After ROSC the goal should be to monitor oxygenation either with a pulse oximeter or preferably with an early arterial blood gas sample. Oxygenation measured early after ROSC is highly variable, varying from hypoxaemia to extreme hyperoxaemia. 81 Thus, it is appropriate to titrate the inspired oxygen by adjusting either the oxygen flow if using bag-mask ventilation or the fraction inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) if using a mechanical ventilator. 82 Prolonged use of 100% inspired oxygen, for example during transport, will lead commonly to extreme hyperoxaemia. 83 Another method for monitoring is using cerebral oxygen monitoring with near infrared spectroscopy, but its role during post resuscitation care is uncertain. 84,85In most post-cardiac arrest patients, controlled oxygenation will require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for at least 24À72 h.

        <p>After ROSC, blood carbon dioxide values (PaCO 2 ) are commonly increased because of intra-arrest hypoventilation and poor tissue perfusion, 86 causing a mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis. 87 Carbon dioxide is a well-known regulator of blood vessel tone and cerebral blood flow. 88 Increased PaCO 2 (hypercapnia) increases cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and intracerebral pressure. Hypocapnia causes vasoconstriction that may decrease blood flow and cause cerebral ischaemia. 89 The main method for controlling PaCO 2 in a mechanically ventilated patient is adjusting the minute volume by changing the ventilation frequency and or tidal volume. In general, limiting the tidal volume and using a lung protective ventilation strategy is the standard of care, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 9,90,91 Acute respiratory distress syndrome is not uncommon in cardiac arrest patients and is associated with worse outcomes. 9,92,93 Low lung compliance predicts poor functional outcome in OHCA patients 94 ; however, ventilation with lower tidal volumes is not standard practice in neurointensive care. 95 Two pilot studies have compared different carbon dioxide targets during post resuscitation care. 75,96 One study found targeting mild hypercapnia (50À55 mmHg) compared with normocapnia (35À45 mmHg) resulted in lower neuron specific enolase (NSE) values, a marker of the magnitude of neurological injury. 96 Another pilot study compared the lower and higher end of the range for normocapnia (33 À45 mmHg) for the first 36 h of post resuscitation care and found no difference in markers of neurological injury. 75 Both of these studies showed that a higher PaCO 2 was associated with higher cerebral oxygenation measured with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), but the clinical implications of this are uncertain. 85 Several large observational studies have aimed to define the optimal CO 2 during post-cardiac arrest care. 97À102 The results are mixed, with some studies indicating harm from both hypo-and hypercapnia and some suggesting better outcome with mild hypercapnia. Recent UK observational data suggest a relationship between arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide. Data from the first 24 h of post resuscitation care observed a combination of hypoxia and hypocapnia was associated with a worse outcome and did not report harm from hyperoxia. 103 Previous observational data from Finnish ICUs reported similar findings. 97 Observational data suggest that patients undergoing TTM are prone to hypocapnia. 104 This may be avoided by frequent measurement of carbon dioxide with arterial blood gas analysis and use of end tidal CO 2 monitoring. In patients undergoing TTM with lower temperature targets, PaCO 2 management including measurement is particularly challenging. 105 There is limited evidence to support a particular method for measuring PaCO 2 during hypothermia, therefore the guidance to use either a temperature or non-temperature corrected approach for measuring blood gases is based on expert opinion. 106 The recommendation for tidal volume is based on current guidance for lung protective ventilation in the ICU 107 and limited observational data from post cardiac arrest patients. 108 One observational study suggests that using a tidal volume of 6À8 mL kg À1 to ventilate the lungs of post-cardiac arrest patients may be associated with improved outcome. 108 This study also showed that by using higher ventilation frequency normocapnia may be achieved. 108After ROSC, blood carbon dioxide values (PaCO 2 ) are commonly increased because of intra-arrest hypoventilation and poor tissue perfusion, 86 causing a mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis. 87 Carbon dioxide is a well-known regulator of blood vessel tone and cerebral blood flow. 88 Increased PaCO 2 (hypercapnia) increases cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and intracerebral pressure.

In general, limiting the tidal volume and using a lung protective ventilation strategy is the standard of care, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 9,90,91 Acute respiratory distress syndrome is not uncommon in cardiac arrest patients and is associated with worse outcomes. 9,92,93 Low lung compliance predicts poor functional outcome in OHCA patients 94 ; however, ventilation with lower tidal volumes is not standard practice in neurointensive care. 95 Two pilot studies have compared different carbon dioxide targets during post resuscitation care. 75,96 One study found targeting mild hypercapnia (50À55 mmHg) compared with normocapnia (35À45 mmHg) resulted in lower neuron specific enolase (NSE) values, a marker of the magnitude of neurological injury. 96 Another pilot study compared the lower and higher end of the range for normocapnia (33 À45 mmHg) for the first 36 h of post resuscitation care and found no difference in markers of neurological injury. 75 Both of these studies showed that a higher PaCO 2 was associated with higher cerebral oxygenation measured with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), but the clinical implications of this are uncertain. 85 Several large observational studies have aimed to define the optimal CO 2 during post-cardiac arrest care. 97À102 The results are mixed, with some studies indicating harm from both hypo-and hypercapnia and some suggesting better outcome with mild hypercapnia. Recent UK observational data suggest a relationship between arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide. Data from the first 24 h of post resuscitation care observed a combination of hypoxia and hypocapnia was associated with a worse outcome and did not report harm from hyperoxia. 103 Previous observational data from Finnish ICUs reported similar findings. 97 Observational data suggest that patients undergoing TTM are prone to hypocapnia. 104 This may be avoided by frequent measurement of carbon dioxide with arterial blood gas analysis and use of end tidal CO 2 monitoring. In patients undergoing TTM with lower temperature targets, PaCO 2 management including measurement is particularly challenging. 105 There is limited evidence to support a particular method for measuring PaCO 2 during hypothermia, therefore the guidance to use either a temperature or non-temperature corrected approach for measuring blood gases is based on expert opinion. 106 The recommendation for tidal volume is based on current guidance for lung protective ventilation in the ICU 107 and limited observational data from post cardiac arrest patients. 108 One observational study suggests that using a tidal volume of 6À8 mL kg À1 to ventilate the lungs of post-cardiac arrest patients may be associated with improved outcome. 108 This study also showed that by using higher ventilation frequency normocapnia may be achieved. 108</p>

        <p>In OHCA patients without ST segment elevation, several large observational series showed that absence of ST segment elevation does not completely exclude the presence of a recent coronary occlusion. 114 Therefore, the decision for early CAG should be based on meticulous patient assessment for the presence of haemodynamic or electrical instability and ongoing myocardial ischaemia taking into account multiple factors including previous medical history, warning symptoms before arrest, initial cardiac rhythm for CA, 115 ECG pattern post ROSC, and echocardiography, as well as comorbidities. When an ischaemic cause is considered likely, a similar approach as for patients with STEMI should be followed. In patients with a low probability of an ischaemic cause of cardiac arrest, delaying CAG for few hours or days may buy time for initial management in ICU, enabling early initiation of post-resuscitation care (haemodynamic optimisation, protective ventilation, TTM) and prognostication. This 'wait and see' management may also avoid performing CAG in patients with the lowest probability of an acute coronary lesion.

        <p>The use of cerebral oxygen saturation or ICP monitoring to determine the presence of autoregulation and to determine an optimal MAP may enable a more individualised approach. 146 In a retrospective study, the estimated optimal MAP (i.e. MAP target at which the autoregulation is more effective) was 85 mmHg in post-cardiac arrest patients with preserved autoregulation and 100 mmHg when the autoregulation was impaired. 133 Another small observational study calculated a median optimal MAP of 89 mmHg in the same setting. 147 However, there are no prospective studies evaluating whether an autoregulation-driven MAP target may influence neurological injury and/or outcome. A more recent study has shown that after cardiac arrest, in particular in cases of non-cardiac origin, episodes of elevated ICP and/or brain hypoxia are frequent and a higher MAP is necessary to improve brain oxygenation. 147 Preliminary evidence based on measurement of brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO 2 ) has shown that in resuscitated comatose patients impairment of oxygen diffusion to the brain may cause persisting brain hypoxia despite optimisation of oxygen delivery to the brain. 148 The implementation and the safety of these invasive monitoring tools in cardiac arrest patients need to be further evaluated. While these are all observational findings, they indicate optimal MAP targets may need to be individualised and support further research into identification of optimal MAP targets for individual cardiac arrest survivors receiving intensive care.

        <p>A meta-analysis shows that mild induced hypothermia is neuroprotective and improves outcomes in animal models of cardiac arrest. 213 The authors conclude that there may be translational gaps because research on large (gyrencephalic) and comorbid animals is uncommon. The theoretical background that lowering core temperature suppresses several detrimental pathways leading to neuronal death is well established, but the specific mechanisms of hypothermic neuroprotection remain unclear. 214 Hypothermia decreases the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO 2 ) by about 6% for each 1 C reduction in core temperature and this reduces the release of excitatory amino acids and the production of free radicals. 215,216 In the temperature range of 33 C to 36 C, however, there is no difference in the inflammatory cytokine response in adult patients. 217 All studies evaluating post-cardiac arrest patients and mild induced hypothermia included only patients with altered consciousness (i.e. Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 9). One randomised trial and a quasi-randomised trial demonstrated improved neurological outcome at hospital discharge or at 6 months in comatose patients after out-ofhospital witnessed cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm. 218,219 Cooling was initiated within minutes to hours after ROSC and a target temperature of 32À34 C was maintained for 12 À24 h. These two trials represented the beginning of modern postcardiac arrest care. More recently, a French multicentre trial randomised 581 adult patients who were comatose after resuscitation of either an IHCA or OHCA with an initial non-shockable rhythm (i.e. asystole or pulseless electrical activity) to either TTM with a target temperature of 33 C or a target temperature of 37 C, for 24 h. 13 The use of TTM at 33 C led to a higher percentage of patients who survived with a favourable neurological outcome at day 90, assessed as a cerebral performance category score (CPC) of 1À2, (10.2% versus 5.7%, difference 4.5%; 95% CI 0.1À8.9; P = 0.04), while mortality did not differ (81.3% versus 83.2%, difference À1.9; 95% CI À8.0À4.3). The benefit of a lower target temperature was more evident in patients with shorter time to ROSC (&lt;15 min) and among inhospital cardiac arrest patients. These results differ from a previous retrospective registry study of 1830 patients with non-shockable OHCA where poor neurological outcome was more common among those receiving mild induced hypothermia (adjusted OR 1.44 [95% CI, 1.04À2.01]. 220 The ongoing targeted hypothermia versus targeted normothermia after OHCA (TTM2) trial will compare a target temperature of 33 C with strict normothermia (&lt;37.8 C) during a 40-h intervention period in 1900 patients and will address the effectiveness of cooling procedures in cardiac arrest patients in comparison with fever management. 14 [ 2 2 _ T D $ D I F F ] Timing to initiate hypothermia [ 2 3 _ T D $ D I F F ] Animal data suggest that TTM should be initiated as soon as possible, 221 although delays of several hours seem to be neuroprotective in several species. 213 Early cooling, i.e. initiated in the prehospital field after ROSC, has been tested in some RCTs 222,223 ; although target temperature could be achieved faster than with standard in-hospital cooling, no significant effect on patient outcomes was reported. Moreover, in one study pre-hospital use of cold fluids to induce early hypothermia was associated with more re-arrests in the field and more frequent pulmonary oedema on admission than the control group. 224 Intra-arrest hypothermia (i.e. initiated during CPR) has been proposed as an effective method to provide TTM; however, use of cold fluids during CPR in a large RCT including OHCA patients showed no improvement in outcome from this strategy and even a decreased ROSC rate in patients with an initial shockable rhythm. 224 One small feasibility trial 225 and one RCT 226 have tested the use of trans-nasal evaporative cooling, which could induce rapid cooling in OHCA patients. Both trials reported no significant benefits on patient outcomes, although in the latter trial a post hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients with an initial shockable rhythm and in whom cooling was initiated &lt; 20 min from collapse showed improved neurological outcome at 90 days. 226,227 [ 2 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] Optimal target temperature during hypothermia [ 2 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] The Targeted Temperature Management after Cardiac Arrest trial (TTM-trial) randomised 950 OHCA patients with both initial shockable and non-shockable rhythms to a strategy including 36 h of temperature control (i.e. 28 h at target temperature followed by slow rewarming) and fever control up to 72 h after randomisation; the two target temperatures during the intervention phase were 33 C or 36 C. 27 Strict protocols were followed for assessing prognosis and for withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST). There was no difference in the primary outcome (i.e. all-cause mortality; hazard ratio 1.06 [95% CI 0.89À1.28]) or in neurological outcome at 6 months (relative risk 1.02 [0.88À1.16]). Neurological outcome and cognitive function were also similar, 228,229 as were brain injury biomarker values. 230,231 TTM at 33 C was associated with decreased heart rate, elevated lactate, the need for increased vasopressor support, and a higher extended cardiovascular SOFA score compared with TTM at 36 C. 136,232 A small three-armed randomised trial compared 32 C with 33 C and 34 C and found no difference in good neurological outcome, assessed as a modified Rankin Score (mRS) of 0À3 at day 90 (62.3% (95% CI 48.3À76.6) vs. 68.2% 95% CI 52.4À81.4) vs. 65.1% (95% CI 49.0À79.0)). 233 Since the publication of previous guidelines, many sites have changed to a target temperature of 36 C in routine practice. 234,235 There have been reports that a change to 36 C has led to worse temperature control and more early fever, 236 but there are other reports showing good compliance with a 36 C-protocol and a possible clinical advantage, such as earlier awakening and less sedative use. 237 Results from two large registry analyses, one from the cardiac arrest registry to enhance survival (CARES) surveillance group in the US 238 and one from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation (ANZICS-CORE) 239 indicate that a widespread change in TTM-use has occurred after publication of the TTM-trial, with a rising average lowest temperature in the ICU and reduced use of TTM. Furthermore, survival decreased, but was not statistically associated with a decreased use of TTM. 238 In this setting, the optimal temperature during mild induced hypothermia is therefore unknown and more highquality large trials are needed. 240 [ 2 5 _ T D $ D I F F ] Duration of hypothermia [ 2 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] The optimal duration for mild induced hypothermia and TTM is unknown although the period of hypothermia is most commonly 24 h. Previous trials treated patients with 12 to 28 h of TTM. 27,218,219 Two observational trials found no difference in outcomes with 24 h compared with 72 h of TTM. 241,242 A recent randomised trial (n = 351) investigated TTM at 33 C during 48 h or 24 h in unconscious patients after OHCA. 243 There was no significant difference in poor neurological outcome between groups (absolute difference 4.9%; relative risk (RR) for a cerebral performance category 1À2 at 6 months 1.08, 95% CI 0.93À1.25). Adverse events were more common in the prolonged cooling group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01À1.12).A meta-analysis shows that mild induced hypothermia is neuroprotective and improves outcomes in animal models of cardiac arrest. 213 The authors conclude that there may be translational gaps because research on large (gyrencephalic) and comorbid animals is uncommon. The theoretical background that lowering core temperature suppresses several detrimental pathways leading to neuronal death is well established, but the specific mechanisms of hypothermic neuroprotection remain unclear. 214 Hypothermia decreases the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO 2 ) by about 6% for each 1 C reduction in core temperature and this reduces the release of excitatory amino acids and the production of free radicals. 215,216 In the temperature range of 33 C to 36 C, however, there is no difference in the inflammatory cytokine response in adult patients. 217 All studies evaluating post-cardiac arrest patients and mild induced hypothermia included only patients with altered consciousness (i.e. Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 9). One randomised trial and a quasi-randomised trial demonstrated improved neurological outcome at hospital discharge or at 6 months in comatose patients after out-ofhospital witnessed cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm. 218,219 Cooling was initiated within minutes to hours after ROSC and a target temperature of 32À34 C was maintained for 12 À24 h. These two trials represented the beginning of modern postcardiac arrest care. More recently, a French multicentre trial randomised 581 adult patients who were comatose after resuscitation of either an IHCA or OHCA with an initial non-shockable rhythm (i.e. asystole or pulseless electrical activity) to either TTM with a target temperature of 33 C or a target temperature of 37 C, for 24 h. 13 The use of TTM at 33 C led to a higher percentage of patients who survived with a favourable neurological outcome at day 90, assessed as a cerebral performance category score (CPC) of 1À2, (10.2% versus 5.7%, difference 4.5%; 95% CI 0.1À8.9; P = 0.04), while mortality did not differ (81.3% versus 83.2%, difference À1.9; 95% CI À8.0À4.3). The benefit of a lower target temperature was more evident in patients with shorter time to ROSC (&lt;15 min) and among inhospital cardiac arrest patients. These results differ from a previous retrospective registry study of 1830 patients with non-shockable OHCA where poor neurological outcome was more common among those receiving mild induced hypothermia (adjusted OR 1.44 [95% CI, 1.04À2.01]. 220 The ongoing targeted hypothermia versus targeted normothermia after OHCA (TTM2) trial will compare a target temperature of 33 C with strict normothermia (&lt;37.8 C) during a 40-h intervention period in 1900 patients and will address the effectiveness of cooling procedures in cardiac arrest patients in comparison with fever management. 14 [ 2 2 _ T D $ D I F F ] Timing to initiate hypothermia [ 2 3 _ T D $ D I F F ] Animal data suggest that TTM should be initiated as soon as possible, 221 although delays of several hours seem to be neuroprotective in several species. 213 Early cooling, i.e. initiated in the prehospital field after ROSC, has been tested in some RCTs 222,223 ; although target temperature could be achieved faster than with standard in-hospital cooling, no significant effect on patient outcomes was reported.

        <p>Routine use of ulcer prophylaxis in intensive care patients does not decrease mortality. 273,274 However, a recent meta-analysis showed that in high-risk patients, the use of ulcer prophylaxis decreased gastrointestinal bleeding. 275 Post-cardiac arrest patients are likely to be at higher risk than general ICU patients given the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents both pre and post arrest. 276 Therefore, it appears reasonable to administer stress ulcer prophylaxis in post-cardiac arrest patients, especially in those with coagulopathy. 35 Unless patients receive anticoagulation because of a myocardial infarction or ischaemia, deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is recommended in critically ill patients. 277,278 The use of antiplatelet drugs do not prevent DVTs. 279 Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients are at risk for developing DVTs especially if treated with TTM. 280 These appear more common in those treated with an invasive TTM device, likely related to catheter placement in the femoral vein. 281 No specific evidence exists on DVT prophylaxis in cardiac arrest patients. Thus, treatment should be individualised and be based on general ICU recommendations. 277 Hyperglycaemia is common after OHCA. 168 Hyperglycaemia is best managed with continuous infusion of insulin. The 2019 Guidelines of the American Diabetes Association recommend a target glucose range of 7.8À10.0 mmol L À1 (140À180 mg dL À1 ) for the majority of critically ill patients. 282 Tight glucose control does not appear to convey benefit and may be associated with hypoglycaemia (&lt;4.0 mmol L À1 (&lt;70 mg dL À1 ), 283 which is harmful in critically ill patients. 284 In general, glucose containing solutions are not recommended in patients with brain injury, 285 but they may be needed to treat hypoglycaemia. 284 Prognostication About two-thirds of in-hospital deaths in patients who are admitted to an intensive care unit in a coma following resuscitation from OHCA are caused by hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury. 23,24 In a minority of cases these deaths occur as a direct consequence of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury which results in an irreversible loss of all brain function, i.e., brain death. 286 However, most of these neurological deaths result from active withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) in patients where the severity of hypoxicischaemic brain injury indicates that survival with a poor neurological outcome is very likely. 26,287 Accurate prognostication is therefore essential in order to avoid an inappropriate WLST in patients who still have a chance of a neurologically meaningful recovery and to avoid futile treatment in patients with a severe and irreversible neurological injury.Routine use of ulcer prophylaxis in intensive care patients does not decrease mortality. 273,274 However, a recent meta-analysis showed that in high-risk patients, the use of ulcer prophylaxis decreased gastrointestinal bleeding. 275 Post-cardiac arrest patients are likely to be at higher risk than general ICU patients given the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents both pre and post arrest. 276 Therefore, it appears reasonable to administer stress ulcer prophylaxis in post-cardiac arrest patients, especially in those with coagulopathy. 35 Unless patients receive anticoagulation because of a myocardial infarction or ischaemia, deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is recommended in critically ill patients. 277,278 The use of antiplatelet drugs do not prevent DVTs. 279 Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients are at risk for developing DVTs especially if treated with TTM. 280 These appear more common in those treated with an invasive TTM device, likely related to catheter placement in the femoral vein. 281 No specific evidence exists on DVT prophylaxis in cardiac arrest patients.

        <p>Neurological outcome after cardiac arrest is most commonly reported using Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC). 288 The CPC is expressed as a five-point scale: CPC 1 (no or minimal neurological disability); CPC 2 (minor neurological disability); CPC 3 (severe neurological disability); CPC 4 (persistent vegetative state); and CPC 5 (death). Another commonly used outcome measure is the modified Rankin Score (mRS), 289 which includes 7 scores, from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (dead). In 2018, a statement from ILCOR 290 suggested using mRS rather than CPC for measuring functional recovery after cardiac arrest, because mRS is more suitable than CPC for discriminating between mild and moderate disability 291,292 and has a substantial interrater reliability. 293 However, most studies on neurological prognosis after cardiac arrest still use CPC.Neurological outcome after cardiac arrest is most commonly reported using Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC). 288 The CPC is expressed as a five-point scale: CPC 1 (no or minimal neurological disability); CPC 2 (minor neurological disability); CPC 3 (severe neurological disability); CPC 4 (persistent vegetative state); and CPC 5 (death).

        <p>For both clarity and statistical purposes in studies on neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest the outcome is dichotomised as 'good' or 'poor'. However, there is no universal consensus on what represents a poor neurological outcome. Up to 2006, most neuroprognostication studies reported CPC 4 or 5 (vegetative state or death) as a poor outcome, and CPC from 1 to 3 (from absent to severe neurological disability) as a good outcome, while after that date an increasing number of studies included CPC 3 (severe neurological disability) among poor neurological outcomes. 294 In a recent systematic review, 15 among 94 total studies on neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest, 90 (96%) defined poor neurological outcome as CPC 3À5 and only four defined poor outcome as CPC 4À5.For both clarity and statistical purposes in studies on neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest the outcome is dichotomised as 'good' or 'poor'.

        <p>In prognostic accuracy studies, a predictor (index test) is assessed for its ability to predict an outcome. This design is like that of diagnostic accuracy studies. However, while in diagnostic accuracy studies the index test is evaluated against another test which represents the reference standard, or gold standard, prognostic accuracy studies evaluate the index test against the occurrence of the predicted event (target condition) after test recording. 295 When test results are expressed in binary format (i.e., positive vs. negative) the accuracy is expressed using sensitivity and specificity, which measure the ability of the test to identify those who will develop or not develop the target condition, respectively. Since most neuroprognostic tests predict poor neurological outcome, having a high specificity (i.e., a very low rate of falsely pessimistic predictions potentially leading to an inappropriate WLST) is desirable. Ideally, an index test should be 100% specific, i.e., its false positive rate (FPR) should be zero, but this is difficult to achieve in practice. There is no universal consensus on how specific an index test should be for neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest. In a recent survey of 640 healthcare providers, the majority (56%) felt an acceptable FPR for WLST from patients who might otherwise have recovered was 0.1%. 296 Along with the absolute value of specificity, precision of its estimate is important. A very specific test predicting poor outcome is of little clinical use when its precision is low, (i.e., when the confidence intervals [CIs] around the point estimate of its specificity are wide), because this indicates a high degree of uncertainty around the estimated specificity. In the 2014 ERC-ESICM Advisory Statement on neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest, 297 the most robust predictors were identified as those in which the upper boundary of the 95% CI of the FPR was below 5%.In prognostic accuracy studies, a predictor (index test) is assessed for its ability to predict an outcome. This design is like that of diagnostic accuracy studies. However, while in diagnostic accuracy studies the index test is evaluated against another test which represents the reference standard, or gold standard, prognostic accuracy studies evaluate the index test against the occurrence of the predicted event (target condition) after test recording. 295 When test results are expressed in binary format (i.e., positive vs. negative) the accuracy is expressed using sensitivity and specificity, which measure the ability of the test to identify those who will develop or not develop the target condition, respectively. Since most neuroprognostic tests predict poor neurological outcome, having a high specificity (i.e., a very low rate of falsely pessimistic predictions potentially leading to an inappropriate WLST) is desirable.

        <p>For some neuroprognostic tests used after cardiac arrest, such as the blood values of biomarkers of neurological injury or the grey matter to white matter density ratio on brain CT, the results are expressed as a continuous variable. In this case, sensitivity and specificity will depend on the value of the variable that is chosen as a threshold to separate positive from negative test results, and the values of sensitivity and specificity that are obtained by varying the positivity threshold across all its possible values are expressed by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The problem with dichotomising continuous predictive variables to obtain a binary test result is that finding a consistent threshold for 100% specificity is difficult. Very high values of test results can be caused by outliers, which cause distortion and reduce test sensitivity.For some neuroprognostic tests used after cardiac arrest, such as the blood values of biomarkers of neurological injury or the grey matter to white matter density ratio on brain CT, the results are expressed as a continuous variable.

        <p>One of the major biases in neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest is self-fulfilling prophecy. This occurs when the treating team is aware of the result of the prognostic test and uses it for decisions that affect patient's outcome, e.g., WLST. This leads to an overestimation of the test performance, and -potentially -to an inappropriate WLST. In a systematic review on neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest published in 2013, 298,299 64/73 (88%) studies were at risk of selffulfilling prophecy bias.One of the major biases in neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest is self-fulfilling prophecy.

        <p>A specific source of bias in neuroprognostic studies after cardiac arrest is the presence of a time lag between the recording of the index test, which is usually done very early after the arrest, and the assessment of the target condition, i.e., neurological outcome. Since recovery from hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury following cardiac arrest requires time, the minimum recommended timing for its assessment is 30 days or later from the event or neurological discharge. 290 However, further neurological recovery can occur later. Consequently, an early prediction of outcome which is confirmed by CPC or mRS measured at hospital discharge may occasionally prove false when the outcome is reassessed later. 302 For that reason, guidelines suggest reassessing neurological outcome at three or six months after the event. 295 The majority of studies included in the systematic review informing the present guidelines reports neurological outcome at least six months after cardiac arrest. 15 Another bias which is partly related to the time delay between index test assessment and outcome is the interference from extracerebral causes of death after cardiac arrest. These include cardiovascular instability, which is the second most common cause of in-hospital death after cardiac arrest, 23 and multiple organ failure due to global ischaemia-reperfusion injury. 303,304 Although the incidence of these complications is maximal early after arrest, death from extracerebral organ failure may occur after neurological recovery. 305 The prevalence of death after awakening was 16% in ICU in a single-centre study, 306 and 4.2% during hospital stay in a recent multicentre European study including 4646 patients. 307 In that study, death occurred at a median time of 9 (3À18) days after awakening, and it was more common after IHCA than after OHCA.A specific source of bias in neuroprognostic studies after cardiac arrest is the presence of a time lag between the recording of the index test, which is usually done very early after the arrest, and the assessment of the target condition, i.e., neurological outcome.

        <p>Ocular reflexes. Ocular reflexes currently used for neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest include pupillary reflex and corneal reflex. The pupillary light reflex (PLR) comprises a temporary reduction of pupil size induced by a light stimulus. Standard PLR (s-PLR) is evaluated visually and elicited generally using a penlight. In recent years, a quantitative evaluation of PLR using portable pupillometers has become available in the ICU. A bilaterally absent s-PLR has low specificity for predicting poor outcome in the first hours after ROSC, but its accuracy progressively increases, and it achieves 100% specificity after 96 h from ROSC with 20À25% sensitivity. 15 This is presumably due to the process of brain recovery after anoxic-ischaemic injury, but it may be due partly to interference from sedatives used in the early post-resuscitation phase to maintain TTM. Standard PLR is inexpensive and easy to use, but it is subjective and prone to interrater variability. 308 Quantitative evaluation of PLR (automated pupillometry) provides an objective and quantifiable measurement of the pupillary response. The most common pupillometry measures are the percentage reduction of pupillary size, generally indicated as qPLR 309 and the neurological pupil index (NPi). 310 NPi is calculated from several dynamic parameters of the pupillary response (including constriction and dilation velocity, size, and percentage size reduction after stimulation) using a proprietary algorithm. A NPi value !3 is considered normal. Limited evidence showed that, unlike s-PLR, NPi can predict unfavourable outcome with no false positive results from 24 h or less to 72 h from ROSC. 15 In one study this was because of the ability of pupillometer to detect a response even when the pupil size was very small, presumably from sedation. 310 Results of pupillometry are expressed as a continuous measure, and threshold for 100% specificity varied among studies. In three studies included in a recent review this threshold for NPi was &lt;2.4 before 24 h and 2.0 at 24À72 h. 15 Another limitation of automated pupillometry is its additional cost.Ocular reflexes.

Because of its high sensitivity (&gt;60% at 72 h or later from ROSC) a M = 1À2 can be used as a criterion for identifying patients needing prognostication after cardiac arrest.

Neuron specific enolase has been recommended for assessment of brain injury and to help prognosticate outcome after cardiac arrest since the last revision in 2015. 2 Their actual use in clinical practice, however, is not known. Several reports on novel biomarker candidates have been published since 2015. 231,370À372 Importantly, a multimodal approach should be used for assessment of comatose survivors after cardiac arrest. Advantages of biomarkers include quantitative results, the relative ease of sampling and interpretation and their independence from the effects of sedatives. Limitations include availability, lack of robust laboratory references, insufficiently large study populations, and lack of external validation for some. Most of the available evidence is limited to a time span of up to 72 h after cardiac arrest which is relevant for most patients. However, it necessitates a strategy for prospective sampling before the assessment of prognosis &gt;72 h post-arrest. Very limited evidence supports the use of biomarkers after 72 h in patients who fail to awaken. Large studies investigating and validating promising novel biomarkers are needed to confirm their predictive value, to assess their reproducibility, and to identify consistent thresholds for a specificity that should be close to 100%. The rationale for accepting a specificity of less than 100% would be that using blood biomarkers, there will always be outliers that must be taken into consideration, e.g. due to poor calibration or issues with laboratory standards, haemolysis or due to poor technique in handling of samples. Demanding 100% specificity from a blood biomarker will lower the sensitivity to levels where their clinical use can be questioned, while allowing an FPR of 1% or 2% will increase their clinical relevance. With a multimodal approach, every prognostic method used for assessment of an individual patient must point in the same direction in order to be trusted. This may be particularly true for biomarkers because of their continuous nature; normal or mildly elevated levels (at correct sampling time) should always alert the clinician of potential error in other methods indicating poor prognosis.Protein biomarkers that are released following injury to neurons and glial cells may be measured in blood and are likely to correlate with the extent of brain injury and with neurological outcome.

        <p>[ 5 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] Following cardiac arrest, hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury causes cytotoxic oedema, which appears as an attenuation of the GM/WM interface, and vasogenic oedema leading to brain swelling, visible as an effacement of cortical sulci. 385 Measurement of the ratio between the GM and the WM densities (GWR), expressed in Hounsfield units is a method to quantify the degree of oedema. The density of the GM is higher than that of the WM, so that GWR is normally higher than 1. The lower the GWR, the greater the severity of brain oedema. GWR reduction occurs early in patients with severe hypoxicischaemic brain injury. In a recent systematic review most studies on reduced GWR showed that this sign was 100% specific for poor neurological outcome as early as 1 h after ROSC. 15 However, in other studies, 301,386À388 a reduced GWR was 100% specific for poor neurological outcome up to 72 h after ROSC. The methods for GWR measurement varied across studies. In most of them, GWR was calculated between GM and WM areas within the basal ganglia. In others, measurements within the cerebrum (centrum semiovale and high convexity area) were performed. 389À391 In almost all studies, a GWR threshold for 100% specificity was identified. However, its value varied across studies. For instance, the threshold for 100% specificity of the average GWR measured at the basal ganglia and the cerebrum ranged from 1.1 and 1.23 within 2 h from ROSC. 15 GWR sensitivity also varied widely across studies, probably reflecting differences between scanners and software, 392 in the methods of calculation, or in the aetiology of the arrest. 390,393 In one substudy of the TTM trial, oedema on brain CT was assessed visually without formal GWR measurement. 394 In that study, specificity for poor neurological outcome was 98.4 [94.3À99.6]% with 33.6 [28.1À39.5]% sensitivity.

        <p>Unlike clinical examination and EEG, imaging studies are not prone to interference from sedative drugs. In addition, they can be assessed blindly. Their major limitation is the lack of standardisation of measurement techniques. Despite the available studies showed a high accuracy both for brain CT and MRI, the number of studies was limited with a wide variability in the adopted measurement techniques which greatly limits the reproducibility of their results. For this reason, it is reasonable to reserve the use of imaging studies for prognostication only in centres where specific experience is available. Since there is currently no standard for CT-GWR or MR-ADC measurements these techniques can be recommended to confirm the presence of generalised and extensive ischaemic injury apparent from conventional visual analysis by an experienced neuroradiologist. Finally, imaging studies cannot be performed at the bedside and MRI may not be feasible in the most unstable patients, which limits its applicability especially in the early postresuscitation period.Unlike clinical examination and EEG, imaging studies are not prone to interference from sedative drugs.

        <p>In 2015, the ERC-ESICM Guidelines on Post-Resuscitation Care included an algorithm for the prediction of poor neurological outcome in patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest. 1 This algorithm has been validated in recent retrospective studies. One study in 226 patients showed that the 2015 ERC-ESICM prognostication guidelines had a 0% FPR for predicting poor outcome (CPC from 3 to 5) both at hospital discharge and at six months. 302 Similarly, in a larger singlecentre cohort including 485 comatose resuscitated patients the ERC-ESICM algorithm predicted CPC 3À5 with 0% FPR in 155 patients. 403 Among the remaining 330 patients in whom no major predictor or combination of predictors suggesting poor outcome were detected, two thirds had good neurological outcome at three months. Finally, in a retrospective multicentre cohort of 585 patients from the TTM trial, the ERC-ESICM algorithm had 0% (95% CI 0À1.2%) FPR for predicting poor neurological outcome at six months. 313 The 2015 ERC-ESICM prognostication algorithm was based on a combination of predictors including results of clinical examination (absent or extensor motor response, absent pupillary and corneal reflexes, status myoclonus), biomarkers (high blood values of NSE), electrophysiology (unreactive burst-suppression or status epilepticus on EEG, bilaterally absent N20 SSEP wave) and imaging (signs of diffuse anoxic brain injury on CT or MRI). The evidence supporting these predictors had been assessed in two reviews published in 2013. 298,299 To facilitate an update for the present guidelines, a new review has been conducted and its results are reported in the previous paragraphs of the present guidelines focusing on individual prognostication modalities. 15 The 2020 review largely confirmed the results of the 2013 reviews and the reliability of the predictors suggested in the 2015 algorithm.

        <p>No consistent definition was found for status epilepticus, a predictor suggested in the 2015 guidelines. Presence of a suppressed EEG background or burst-suppression predicted poor outcome with very low FPR, especially when recorded after 24À72 h from ROSC; in the previous reviews, evidence supporting suppression was negligible, and definitions of burst-suppression were heterogeneous. Several prognostication studies classified EEG according to the Standardised Critical Care EEG Terminology (2012 version) of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS). 404 The risk of bias for most of the available studies was high.

        <p>Prognostic assessment should start with an accurate clinical examination. 405 Its main scope is to confirm that the patient is comatose because of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury. Clinical examination should be performed daily to detect signs of neurological recovery such as purposeful movements or to identify a clinical picture suggesting impending brain death. The latter may include fixed, dilated pupils, diabetes insipidus, and cardiovascular changes suggesting herniation, such as bradycardia associated with hypertension or an otherwise unexplained haemodynamic instability. Brain death occurs in 5À10% of patients who die after cardiac arrest resuscitated with conventional CPR and in about 25% of patients who die after resuscitation with extracorporeal CPR. 286 In most cases, brain death occurs during the first 3À4 days after ROSC. A suggested algorithm for brain death screening after cardiac arrest is shown in Fig. 7. The World Brain Death Project (WBDP) consensus group has published detailed guidance on the determination of brain death after treatment with targeted temperature management (TTM). 406 In most patients, awakening from coma following cardiac arrest occurs within 3À4 days from ROSC. 202,305 However, patients who are initially unconscious following cardiac arrest are usually treated with sedatives and neuromuscular blocking drugs to enable targeted temperature management (TTM), and to facilitate mechanical ventilation and other life support measures. Therefore, to enable a reliable clinical examination, these drugs should be stopped for sufficient time to avoid interference from their effects. The WBDP consensus group recommends that clinical examination be delayed until at least 5 elimination half-lives of the drug administered with the longest half-life. 406 Although this recommendation has been made in the context of diagnosing brain death, it is equally relevant to prognostic assessment if this is being used to make a WLST decision. Short-acting drugs are preferred whenever possible but even a shortacting drug such as propofol has a half-life of 2.3À4.7 h, which implies the need to stop sedatives for at least 24 h in most cases. This will be much longer if there is renal and/or hepatic impairment or if longeracting drugs have been given. When residual sedation or paralysis is suspected, consider using antidotes to reverse the effects of these drugs. Use caution when administering flumazenil to reverse the effect of benzodiazepines because this may precipitate seizures. Apart from sedation and neuromuscular blockade, other major confounders include hypothermia, severe hypotension, sepsis, and metabolic or respiratory derangements.Prognostic assessment should start with an accurate clinical examination. 405 Its main scope is to confirm that the patient is comatose because of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury.

        <p>A poor motor response has a relatively low specificity, but a high sensitivity for prediction of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. Therefore, it can be used to identify patients needing prognostication. An absent or extensor motor response (M 2) of the Glasgow Coma Scale was the entry point of the 2015 prognostication algorithm. However, recent evidence showed that using M 3 as an entry point increases the sensitivity for prediction of poor outcome without reducing specificity. 313,407 The prognostication strategy described below applies to patients who are comatose with a motor response (M) equal to or below 3 (abnormal flexion, extension, or nil) at !72 h after ROSC. Results of earlier prognostic tests are also considered at this time.A poor motor response has a relatively low specificity, but a high sensitivity for prediction of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.

        <p>Signs suggesting the potential for recovery should be actively sought. These are often identified early in the clinical course after resuscitation. In a study on 357 comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, a benign EEG (continuous, reactive, non-suppressed background without epileptiform discharges) recorded within 24 h from ROSC predicted good neurological outcome with 76 [69À82]% sensitivity and 88 [82À92]% specificity. 338 In 250 patients with indeterminate outcome on day 3 according to the 2015 ERC-ESICM prognostication algorithm presence of a benign EEG was associated with good neurological outcome in 184 cases (positive predictive value 74%). 403 Among 14 patients who recovered after their outcome was defined as indeterminate in another validation study, the majority had low and decreasing NSE values and all but one had ventricular fibrillation on the initial ECG. 313 Other potentially useful indices of good neurological outcome include absence of diffusion changes on brain MRI and low blood values of neurofilament light chain within 72 h from ROSC. 231,389,397,398 Recent evidence showed that a benign EEG is not associated with the presence of other predictors of poor neurological outcome, especially a bilaterally absent N20 SSEP wave. 408À410 Therefore, when predictors suggesting a potential for recovery coexist with others suggesting a poor outcome, there is a chance that the latter signal is a false positive. We suggest that in this case the results of predictive indices are reassessed, and index tests be repeated if possible.Signs suggesting the potential for recovery should be actively sought.

        <p>In a comatose patient with M 3 at !72 h from ROSC, in absence of confounders, poor outcome is likely when two or more of the following predictors are present: no pupillary and corneal reflexes at !72 h, bilaterally absent N20 SSEP wave at !24 h, highly malignant EEG at &gt;24 h, NSE &gt;60 mg/L at 48 h and/or 72 h, status myoclonus 72 h, or a diffuse and extensive anoxic injury on brain CT/MRI. Most of these signs can be recorded before 72 h from ROSC, however their results will be evaluated only at the time of clinical prognostic assessment. A recent study has shown that a strategy of using !2 predictors had 0 [0À8]% FPR compared with 7 [1À18]% of the 2015 ERC-ESICM stepwise strategy (due to false positives for pupillary light reflexes). 411 Evidence from both the 2013 and the 2020 reviews showed that a bilaterally absent N20 SSEP wave is the most widely documented predictor of poor outcome and the one most consistently associated with 100% specificity. However, false positive predictions have occasionally been reported. In some of these cases, the cause of a false positive result was an incorrect reading of the SSEP record because of artefacts. 412 Neuromuscular blockade improves readability of SSEPs and it should be considered whenever possible. 413 Pupillary light reflex and corneal reflex are also very specific for poor outcome when bilaterally absent at 72 h or more after ROSC. Based on expert opinion, we suggest that both reflexes should be absent at the time of prognostic assessment for them to reliably predict poor outcome. Unlike SSEPs, ocular reflexes are prone to interference from sedation. Corneal reflexes may also be affected by neuromuscular blocking drugs. These confounders should be excluded before ocular reflexes are assessed. Visual evaluation of PLR may be hampered when the pupil size is less than 6 mm. 308 Limited evidence shows that in resuscitated comatose patients automated pupillometry is more sensitive than s-PLR in detecting pupil response to light when pupil size is small, which reduces the risk of false positive results. 310 Unlike s-PLR, automated pupillometry delivers a stimulating light source with standard characteristics (intensity, duration, and distance from the eye) and measures pupillary response quantitatively, which ensures reproducibility. For this reason, we suggest detecting the absence of PLR with a pupillometer, if available.In a comatose patient with M 3 at !72 h from ROSC, in absence of confounders, poor outcome is likely when two or more of the following predictors are present: no pupillary and corneal reflexes at !72 h, bilaterally absent N20 SSEP wave at !24 h, highly malignant EEG at &gt;24 h, NSE &gt;60 mg/L at 48 h and/or 72 h, status myoclonus 72 h, or a diffuse and extensive anoxic injury on brain CT/MRI.

Visual evaluation of PLR may be hampered when the pupil size is less than 6 mm. 308 Limited evidence shows that in resuscitated comatose patients automated pupillometry is more sensitive than s-PLR in detecting pupil response to light when pupil size is small, which reduces the risk of false positive results. 310 Unlike s-PLR, automated pupillometry delivers a stimulating light source with standard characteristics (intensity, duration, and distance from the eye) and measures pupillary response quantitatively, which ensures reproducibility. For this reason, we suggest detecting the absence of PLR with a pupillometer, if available.</p>
        <p>Status myoclonus is a prolonged period of myoclonic jerks. Although there is no universal definition for status myoclonus, based on our previous definition 1 we suggest that, in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, status myoclonus should be defined as a continuous and generalised myoclonus persisting for 30 min or more. In the 2020 review informing the present guidelines, status myoclonus was documented in two studies, one of which used a definition comparable to that given above. In total, among 113 patients showing this sign, there was only one false positive result. Aside from duration and continuity, other clinical features of myoclonus suggest poor outcome. These include a generalised (vs. focal), axial (vs. distal), or stereotyped (vs. variable) distribution. Conversely, some EEG features, such as a continuous or reactive background or presence of spike-wave discharges synchronised with the myoclonic jerks indicate a potential for good outcome. 181 We suggest recording an EEG in patients with post-arrest status myoclonus, in order both to identify an associated epileptiform activity and to detect signs associated with potential recovery.Status myoclonus is a prolonged period of myoclonic jerks.

        <p>Among unfavourable EEG patterns, those more consistently associated with poor neurological outcome are suppression and burst suppression. According to the ACNS, a suppressed EEG background is defined as &gt;99% of activity having a voltage less than 10 mV, while burst-suppression is defined as 50À99% of the record consisting of suppression, alternated with bursts. In the 2013 reviews, definitions of these patterns were inconsistent. We suggest using the ACNS terminology when assessing these patterns for prognostication, in order to ensure an unequivocal identification. 187 During the first 12 À24 h after ROSC, both these patterns have a greater prevalence, but also a higher risk of false positive prediction. Confounding from sedatives used to facilitate TTM may contribute to this. We suggest using these EEG patterns for prognostication only after 24 h from ROSC. Absence of EEG background reactivity has an inconsistent specificity for poor neurological outcome and we no longer recommend using it for this purpose.Among unfavourable EEG patterns, those more consistently associated with poor neurological outcome are suppression and burst suppression.

        <p>High blood NSE values are a sign of neuronal cell damage and have long been recommended as a predictor of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. 414 However, there is still uncertainty about what are the optimal timings and thresholds. Evidence from our review showed that, while prediction with 0% FPR can be achieved anytime from 24 h to 7 days after ROSC, the sensitivity of an individual NSE measurement for prediction of poor neurological outcome with 0% FPR is highest at 48À72 h after ROSC. 15 However, our review confirmed that the NSE threshold value for 0% FPR is inconsistent because of a few patients with good neurological outcome despite very high NSE values. The presence of these outliers can be partly explained with a release of NSE from extracerebral sources, such as red blood cells or neuroendocrine tumours. Repeated blood sampling and careful exclusion of extracerebral sources is recommended when using NSE for neuroprognostication. Another cause of variability for the NSE thresholds is represented by the different measurement techniques used. 381 In our 2020 review, the highest recorded NSE thresholds for 0% FPR at 48 and 72 h from ROSC were 120 mg L À1 and 79 mg L À1 , respectively. However, these data refer to outliers, and in most studies the 0% FPR threshold was 60 mg L À1 and 50 mg L À1 , respectively. Based on these data, we presume that the risk of a false positive prediction associated with an NSE value of 60 mg L À1 is minimal, especially because the NSE signal should be confirmed by at least another predictor. Nevertheless, we suggest that hospital laboratories using NSE create their own normal values and cut-off levels based on the test kit used. Increasing NSE values between 24 h and 48 h or between 24/48 h and 72 h also suggests a poor outcome even if the incremental prognostic value of adding NSE trends to a single NSE value is uncertain. 15,375,379 We suggest performing serial NSE samples at 24, 48, and 72 h after ROSC so that NSE trends can be detected and confounding from occasional haemolysis can be minimised.High blood NSE values are a sign of neuronal cell damage and have long been recommended as a predictor of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. 414 However, there is still uncertainty about what are the optimal timings and thresholds.

        <p>Signs of diffuse and extensive hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury on brain CT include an effacement of cortical sulci and reduced ventricle size (mainly from vasogenic oedema) and a reduced density of the grey matter with reduction or loss of the grey matter/white matter (GM/ WM) interface due to cytotoxic oedema. In the review informing these guidelines, the first sign was evaluated qualitatively in one study, 394 based on visual inspection from a neuroradiologist, while most studies assessed the reduced GM/WM interface as the ratio of the densities of the grey matter and the white matter (GWR) measured in Hounsfield units. This was generally done within 2 h from ROSC, but some studies assessed GWR within 24 h, 301,386 and one within 72 h. 388 As for other predictors based on continuous variables, the GWR thresholds for 0% FPR varied across studies, presumably because of variations in the methods for GWR calculation, or in the software or scanner' characteristics. 15 Hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury reduces water diffusivity, which appears on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a hyperintensity on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with corresponding low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. In severe hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, hyperintensity on DWI involves the cerebral cortex extensively and the basal ganglia. Measurement of ADC enables a quantitative assessment of the severity of diffusion changes. In studies on prognostication after cardiac arrest, three methods for ADC measurement were described: the mean global or regional ADC value of the brain, 401 the proportion of voxels with low ADC, 402 and the maximum size of the MRI clusters with minimum ADC. 400 All these studies identified ADC thresholds for 0% FPR, often with a corresponding high sensitivity. However, these thresholds were inconsistent across different areas of the brain within the same study and the same technique.Signs of diffuse and extensive hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury on brain CT include an effacement of cortical sulci and reduced ventricle size (mainly from vasogenic oedema) and a reduced density of the grey matter with reduction or loss of the grey matter/white matter (GM/ WM) interface due to cytotoxic oedema.

        <p>When none of the criteria for poor outcome described above are present, neurological outcome remains indeterminate (Fig. 5). We therefore suggest observation and repeated re-evaluation of patients with indeterminate outcome to detect signs of awakening. In three studies conducted in resuscitated comatose patients treated with TTM for 24 h, the prevalence of late awakening, defined as a recovery of consciousness at !48 h from suspension of sedation was 20/89 (22%), 415 56/194 (29%), 305 and 78/228 (34%). 204 Last awakening occurred on day 11, day 12, and day 23 from suspension of sedation, respectively. In two other studies, the last patient awoke on day 22 and day 29. 403,416 Organ dysfunction, such as post-resuscitation shock or renal failure 204,305 and use of midazolam instead of propofol for sedation 204,265 were associated with a higher likelihood of late awakening, which suggests that at least some of these cases may have been due to a reduced clearance of sedation. In a before-and-after study comparing two sedative regimens (propofol-remifentanil versus midazolam-fentanyl) in 460 comatose resuscitated patients undergoing TTM, use of propofol-remifentanil was associated with significantly lower odds of delayed awakening after adjustment (OR 0.08 [0.03À0.2]), 305 confirming indirect evidence from a previous smaller study. 264 Late awakening does not preclude full neurological recovery. However, the likelihood of awakening in resuscitated patients who remain comatose decreases progressively with time and the rates of good neurological outcome are generally lower in late vs. early awakeners. 204,305,416 The present guidelines apply only to neurological prognostication. Besides hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, other, albeit less common, causes of death in resuscitated comatose patients include cardiovascular instability, 23 and multiple organ failure. 303,304 These factors may result in treatment limitations independently from the patient's neurological status or cause non-neurological death even after neurological recovery has occurred. 295,307,417 In clinical practice, a comprehensive prognostic approach in resuscitated comatose patients should inevitably consider the role of extracerebral factors as well as patient characteristics such as age, comorbidities, and functional status.When none of the criteria for poor outcome described above are present, neurological outcome remains indeterminate (Fig. 5).

        <p>While a minority of the resuscitated patients treated in an ICU die during the first few days due to cardiovascular collapse or massive brain swelling causing brain death, most deaths will be secondary to a decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapy (WLST). 22,23,26,303 Generally, a presumption that the final neurological outcome of the patient will be poor is central to this decision. 26 Pre-existing comorbidities may also contribute to a WLST decision. 22 The clinical team discussing the prognosis of an individual patient needs to consider that inaccurately pessimistic prognostication could lead to WLST in patients who might otherwise achieve a good functional outcome but also that overly conservative prognostication could leave patients in a severely disabled state undesired by themselves and their relatives. 418 Patients may not receive specific treatments because they are not available, or because there is an active decision to withhold them. The main reasons for withholding treatments are that they will not benefit the patient or, if known, the patient's wishes not to have a specific treatment. 418,419 There are few specific data on withholding life sustaining therapies in post-cardiac arrest patients specifically.While a minority of the resuscitated patients treated in an ICU die during the first few days due to cardiovascular collapse or massive brain swelling causing brain death, most deaths will be secondary to a decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapy (WLST). 22,23,26,303 Generally, a presumption that the final neurological outcome of the patient will be poor is central to this decision. 26 Pre-existing comorbidities may also contribute to a WLST decision. 22 The clinical team discussing the prognosis of an individual patient needs to consider that inaccurately pessimistic prognostication could lead to WLST in patients who might otherwise achieve a good functional outcome but also that overly conservative prognostication could leave patients in a severely disabled state undesired by themselves and their relatives. 418 Patients may not receive specific treatments because they are not available, or because there is an active decision to withhold them.

        <p>The practice of WLST varies widely across Europe and impacts the proportion of CA-patients surviving with severe brain injury (CPC 3 À4). Lacking high-quality data, this fraction appears to vary widely from approximately 10À50%. 243,300,417 The most apparent effects are seen for patients who remain in an unresponsive wakefulness/ vegetative state (CPC 4). As an example, 1/243 (0.4%) survivors in a northern European study 243 compared with 61/195 (31%) in an Italian multi-centre study 300 were in CPC 4 at 6 months. Evidence for variation in WLST practice across Europe was also found in the Ethicus Study: physicians from southern Europe were less prone to withdraw treatment compared with those from northern Europe, and there was also an effect of religion. 420 The Ethicus-2 Study has shown that the frequency of WLST and withholding decisions among general ICU patients has increased over the last 15À20 years. 421 Recent studies, based on propensity score matching, indicate that premature (&lt;72 h) WLST for neurological reasons are common and may be the cause of death for a substantial proportion of patients who might have recovered to a good outcome if their intensive care treatment had been prolonged. 422,423 The brain stem is more resistant to hypoxic-ischaemic injury than the cerebrum and the recovery of functions such as spontaneous breathing and sleep-wake cycle is part of the trajectory towards an unresponsive wakefulness/vegetative syndrome. The period when the patient is still dependent on intensive care is sometimes referred to as the 'window of opportunity for death'. 424 This perception may cause a sense of urgency for the relatives and treating team indirectly impacting decisions on premature WLST. 425,426 One qualitative study identified limitations in family-team communication as an important factor for premature WLST after cardiac arrest. 426 Caregivers' inappropriate avoidance of uncertainty may also be important, leading to overly pessimistic perceptions of the prognosis. 427 Although some tests show high specificity for predicting a poor outcome before 72 h, we recommend that, in general, conclusions about the neurological prognosis are postponed until at least 72 h after the cardiac arrest and the influence of sedative and metabolic factors have been ruled out. This will enable most patients with good outcome to awaken before the prognostic assessment, decreasing the risk of false predictions. 265 We encourage local protocols on how to collect information about the extent of brain injury during the first days. Use all available resources to inform a multimodal assessment. 9,15 Relatives will require regular clear and structured information and an understanding of their role in decision-making. Early indicators of poor prognosis may be conveyed in a balanced fashion to inform relatives that the situation is grave and enable time for adjustment before critical decisions are made. The bedside nurses are confronted by grieving caregivers, which may be very stressful. 426 Allocate sufficient time for communication around the prognosis within the team and with the relatives. 428 While the assessment of post-cardiac arrest neurological prognosis and discussions about WLST are most often linked, try to separate these processes in discussions and documentation. Decisions about WLST need to consider several aspects other than the perceived brain injury; for example, age, co-morbidities and the prognosis for general organ function. 22 Consequently, for ethical reasons, WLST may be considered for patients in whom the neurological prognosis is uncertain or even favourable. Conversely, intensive care may be prolonged despite dismal neurological prognosis because absolute certainty is unobtainable for an individual patient. 429 The patient's preferences are central. Since the patient cannot be asked and advance directives are rare among cardiac arrest victims, the relatives are usually the primary source of information about the patient's likely wishes.The practice of WLST varies widely across Europe and impacts the proportion of CA-patients surviving with severe brain injury (CPC 3 À4).

        <p>In countries where WLST is not practiced widely, poor outcome because of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury is common. 387,430 The prognosis of patients who are still comatose or in an unresponsive wakefulness state one month after the cardiac arrest is poor and they rarely recover. 430,431 In contrast, in countries practising WLST, the majority of survivors are defined as having a 'good' neurological outcome based on global outcome measures such as Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) or the Glasgow Outcome Scale/Extended (GOS/E). 290,412,432À434 However, these measures are not sufficiently sensitive to capture the problems that many of the survivors experience, including cognitive, emotional and physical problems and fatigue. 435À437 In fact, approximately 40 À50% of the survivors have long-term cognitive impairments. 229,438,439 Impairments are mostly mild to moderate and, although all cognitive domains can be affected, most problems are seen in memory, attention, processing speed and executive functioning (e.g. planning, organisation, initiation, flexibility). 229,435,438À440 In general, most cognitive recovery occurs during the first three months after the cardiac arrest. 441À443 Emotional problems are also common. Three to six months after the cardiac arrest anxiety is present in 15À30% of the survivors and remains in 15À23% at 12 months. 444À446 Depressive symptoms range from 13À32% at 3À6 months and decrease to 5À15% at 12 months. 444À447 Symptoms of post-traumatic stress remain in about a quarter of the survivors. 436,444,447,448 Furthermore, some survivors show behavioural problems, such as aggressive/ uninhibited behaviour or emotional lability. 439 Fatigue is also frequently reported and is present in approximately 70% of the survivors at six months and remains in half of the survivors one year after the event. 444,449,450 Physical problems, including rib fractures, muscle weakness and ambulation difficulties, have also been reported. 437,444,451,452 However, the impact of survival on physical function has received little attention; when compared with age and gender-matched populations, reduced physical functioning has been reported in survivors at 3-months, 453 6-months, 452 12months, 434 and three years. 451 Almost half of survivors report limitations because of physical difficulties at 6-months, 452 with up to 40% describing mobility problems 434,439,444,454 and limitations in usual activities at 12-months. 434,444,454 After discharge, most survivors are able to return home and only a small percentage (1À10%) need to be admitted to a long-term care facility. 444,454,455 The large majority (82À91%) are independent in their basic activities of daily living (ADL). 228,438,451,454 Although most survivors are able to resume their pre-arrest activities, they experience more restrictions in societal participation compared with myocardial infarction patients. 444,450 Cognitive impairments, depression, fatigue and restricted mobility are negative predictors for future participation. 450 Of those who were previously working, 63À85% are able to return to work, although some need to adapt their working hours or activities. 434,444,450,451,454,456À458 Decreased likelihood of return to work is associated with cognitive problems and fatigue, unwitnessed OHCA, absence of bystander CPR, female gender, higher age and lower socio-economic status. 450,453,456À458 Cognitive impairments, emotional problems and female gender are associated with a lower quality of life. 434,442,452,453,459À464 However, general health related quality of life is, on average, reported as good with overall scores approaching normal population values, as was shown in two systematic reviews and confirmed in several more recent studies. 228,434,454,465,466 Such generic assessments lack sufficient granularity to comprehensively capture the breadth of problems experienced by survivors, with the result that the impact of cardiac arrest survival may be incompletely captured. 290 Supplementing such generic assessment with condition or problem-specific assessment is recommended. 290 More detailed information on recovery and long-term outcome after cardiac arrest, as well as a description of the current rehabilitation practices in Europe can be found in the epidemiology section of the 2021 European Resuscitation Council Guidelines. 467 In-hospital assessment and follow-up after hospital dischargeIn countries where WLST is not practiced widely, poor outcome because of hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury is common. 387,430 The prognosis of patients who are still comatose or in an unresponsive wakefulness state one month after the cardiac arrest is poor and they rarely recover. 430,431 In contrast, in countries practising WLST, the majority of survivors are defined as having a 'good' neurological outcome based on global outcome measures such as Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) or the Glasgow Outcome Scale/Extended (GOS/E). 290,412,432À434 However, these measures are not sufficiently sensitive to capture the problems that many of the survivors experience, including cognitive, emotional and physical problems and fatigue. 435À437 In fact, approximately 40 À50% of the survivors have long-term cognitive impairments. 229,438,439 Impairments are mostly mild to moderate and, although all cognitive domains can be affected, most problems are seen in memory, attention, processing speed and executive functioning (e.g. planning, organisation, initiation, flexibility). 229,435,438À440 In general, most cognitive recovery occurs during the first three months after the cardiac arrest. 441À443 Emotional problems are also common.

        <p>There is wide variation among hospitals in the availability and type of post resuscitation care, as well as clinical outcomes. 532À534 Cardiac arrest centres are hospitals providing evidence-based resuscitation treatments including emergency interventional cardiology, and bundled critical care with targeted temperature management, and protocolised cardiorespiratory support and prognostication. 122,207 An expert consensus paper published by the Association of Acute Cardiovascular Care (ACVA), and many other European organisations including the ERC and ESICM, states that the minimum requirements for a cardiac arrest centre are 24/7 availability of an on-site coronary angiography laboratory, an emergency department, an intensive care unit (ICU), imaging facilities, such as echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. 16 ILCOR suggests that wherever possible, adult patients with nontraumatic OHCA cardiac arrest should be cared for in cardiac arrest centres. 17 This weak recommendation is based on very low certainty evidence from a systematic review that included 21 observational studies. 535À555 and 1 pilot randomised trial. 556 Seventeen of these studies were included in a meta-analysis that found that patients cared for at cardiac arrest centres had improved survival to hospital discharge with favourable neurological outcome, but this was nonsignificant at 30 days. 535À541,545À552, 554,555 One observational study reported higher adjusted patient survival associated with direct transfer to a cardiac arrest centre compared with secondary interfacility transfer, 552 but two other studies making the same comparisons report no difference in adjusted survival. 536,541 One observational study reported higher adjusted survival in patients who underwent secondary transfer to a cardiac arrest centre compared with remaining at the initial non-cardiac arrest centre. 550There is wide variation among hospitals in the availability and type of post resuscitation care, as well as clinical outcomes. 532À534 Cardiac arrest centres are hospitals providing evidence-based resuscitation treatments including emergency interventional cardiology, and bundled critical care with targeted temperature management, and protocolised cardiorespiratory support and prognostication. 122,207 An expert consensus paper published by the Association of Acute Cardiovascular Care (ACVA), and many other European organisations including the ERC and ESICM, states that the minimum requirements for a cardiac arrest centre are 24/7 availability of an on-site coronary angiography laboratory, an emergency department, an intensive care unit (ICU), imaging facilities, such as echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. 16 ILCOR suggests that wherever possible, adult patients with nontraumatic OHCA cardiac arrest should be cared for in cardiac arrest centres. 17 This weak recommendation is based on very low certainty evidence from a systematic review that included 21 observational studies. 535À555 and 1 pilot randomised trial. 556 Seventeen of these studies were included in a meta-analysis that found that patients cared for at cardiac arrest centres had improved survival to hospital discharge with favourable neurological outcome, but this was nonsignificant at 30 days. 535À541,545À552, 554,555 One observational study reported higher adjusted patient survival associated with direct transfer to a cardiac arrest centre compared with secondary interfacility transfer, 552 but two other studies making the same comparisons report no difference in adjusted survival. 536,541 One observational study reported higher adjusted survival in patients who underwent secondary transfer to a cardiac arrest centre compared with remaining at the initial non-cardiac arrest centre. 550</p>
