        <p>There are currently more commercially available antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 than any other infectious disease. By May 2020, over 200 tests were available or in development 1 . Accurate antibody tests are essential to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic at population level, to understand immune response and to assess individual's exposure and possible immunity from reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. Serology for national surveillance remains the fourth key pillar of the UK's national testing response 2 .There are currently more commercially available antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 than any other infectious disease.

        <p>Access to high throughput laboratory testing to support clinical diagnosis in hospitals is improving. However, the use of serology for large scale seroprevalence studies is limited by the need to take venous blood and transport it to centralised laboratories, as well as assay costs. Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) offer the potential for relatively cheap tests that are easily distributed and can be either self-administered or performed by trained healthcare workers. However, despite manufacturers' claims of high sensitivity and specificity, reported performance of these assays has been variable 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and their use limited to date.Access to high throughput laboratory testing to support clinical diagnosis in hospitals is improving.

        <p>In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) requires that clinical sensitivity and specificity must be determined for each claimed specimen type, and that sample equivalence must be shown 10 . For antibody tests intended to determine whether an individual has had the virus, the MHRA recommend a sensitivity &gt;98% (95% CI 96-100%) (on a minimum of 200 known positive specimens, collected 20 days or more after symptom onset), and specificity &gt;98% on a minimum 200 known negatives 10 . To date, no LFIAs have been approved for use by these criteria. However, LFIAs with lower sensitivity can still play an important role in population seroprevalence surveys 11 , in which individual results are not used to guide behaviour, provided specificity (and positive predictive value) is high. Such tests will need to have established performance characteristics for testing in primary care or community settings, including self-testing.In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) requires that clinical sensitivity and specificity must be determined for each claimed specimen type, and that sample equivalence must be shown 10 .

        <p>As part of the REACT (REal Time Assessment of Community Transmission) programme 12 we assessed LFIAs for their suitability for use in large seroprevalence studies. This study addresses the key questions of how well lateral flow immunoassays perform in people who don't require hospitalisation, and how finger prick self-testing compares with laboratory testing of serum on LFIAs and ELISA.As part of the REACT (REal Time Assessment of Community Transmission) programme 12 we assessed LFIAs for their suitability for use in large seroprevalence studies.

        <p>Between 1 st -29 th May 2020, adult NHS workers (clinical or non-clinical), who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, but not hospitalised, were invited to enrol into a prospective rapid antibody testing study, across four hospitals in two London NHS trusts. Participants were enrolled once they were at least 21 days from the onset of symptoms, or positive swab test (whichever was earlier). Sera for specificity testing were collected prior to August 2019 as part of the Airwaves study 13 from police personnel.Between 1 st -29 th May 2020, adult NHS workers (clinical or non-clinical), who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, but not hospitalised, were invited to enrol into a prospective rapid antibody testing study, across four hospitals in two London NHS trusts.

        <p>LFIAs were selected based on manufacturers performance data, published data, where available, and the potential for supply to large scale seroprevalence surveys. Initially five LFIAs were assessed, with a view to using the highest performing test in a national seroprevalence survey commencing in June 2020 (Phase I). Following selection of an initial candidate, further evaluation was undertaken of LFIAs to be considered for future seroprevalence surveys (Phase II, ongoing). For all LFIAs, sensitivity analysis was conducted on a minimum 100 sera from the assembled cohort. LFIAs with &gt;80% sensitivity underwent further specificity testing, and those with specificity &gt;98% are being evaluated in clinic.LFIAs were selected based on manufacturers performance data, published data, where available, and the potential for supply to large scale seroprevalence surveys.

        <p>Of tests included in Phase I, one detected combined IgM and IgG as a single band, three had separate bands for IgM and IgG, and one detected IgG only. This study set out to determine sensitivity and specificity of tests in detecting IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, at least 21 days from symptom onset. For consistency, in the three kits which had separate IgM and IgG bands, only IgG was counted as a positive result (i.e. 'MG' or 'G' but not 'M', distinct from manufacturer guidance).Of tests included in Phase I, one detected combined IgM and IgG as a single band, three had separate bands for IgM and IgG, and one detected IgG only.

        <p>To assess concordance, each finger-prick self-test in the clinic was performed with the same participant's serum in the laboratory. Test evaluations were conducted according to manufacturer's instructions, by a technician blinded from the clinic result or patient details. Any invalid tests in the laboratory were repeated. Initially, scoring was performed independently by two individuals, but this practice ceased after inter-rater scoring was found to be almost perfect by 6-point categorical score (0-6) (Kappa = 0.81) 14 and perfect on binary outcome (positive/negative) (supplementary table 4).To assess concordance, each finger-prick self-test in the clinic was performed with the same participant's serum in the laboratory.

        <p>Given uncertainties over the proportion of individuals who develop antibodies with non-hospitalised disease, additional serological testing was performed with two laboratory ELISAs: spike protein enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA) and a hybrid spike protein receptor binding domain double antigen bridging assay (Hybrid DABA). Both ELISAs were shown to be highly specific. Details of these methodologies and their prior specificity testing are available in the supplementary section. Sensitivity of each LFIA in clinic and laboratory was assessed vs PCR-confirmed cases, vs S-ELISA and vs hybrid DABA.Given uncertainties over the proportion of individuals who develop antibodies with non-hospitalised disease, additional serological testing was performed with two laboratory ELISAs: spike protein enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA) and a hybrid spike protein receptor binding domain double antigen bridging assay (Hybrid DABA).

        <p>The primary outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of each rapid test. For sensitivity, tests were compared against two standards (i) PCR-confirmed clinical disease (via swab testing) and (ii) positivity in patients with either a positive S-ELISA and/or hybrid DABA in the laboratory. LFIA performance was assessed with i) finger-prick self-testing (participant interpretation); ii) fingerprick self-testing (trained observer interpretation); and iii) serum in the laboratory. Specificity of LFIAs was evaluated against the known negative samples, with all positives counting as false positives. The analysis included all available data for the relevant outcome and are presented with the corresponding binomial exact 95% confidence interval (95%CI).The primary outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of each rapid test.

        <p>We assessed LFIA sensitivity on sera from 276 NHS workers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at a median 44 days from symptom onset (range 21-100 days). 72% reported no, mild or moderate symptoms, 28% reported severe symptoms, none were hospitalised (table 1). The most common symptoms described were lethargy (78%), loss of smell (66%), fever (61%), myalgia (61%) and headache (61%) (supplementary table iii). Less than half reported persistent cough (46%) or dyspnoea (41%). Median symptom duration was 13 days.We assessed LFIA sensitivity on sera from 276 NHS workers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at a median 44 days from symptom onset (range 21-100 days). 72% reported no, mild or moderate symptoms, 28% reported severe symptoms, none were hospitalised (table 1).

        <p>Of the five LFIAs tested in lab and clinic, sensitivity of two of the tests was reduced in a clinical setting using finger-prick self-testing, giving positive results for 21.9% (95% CI [13.1, 33.1]) (80% in lab) and 61.2% (95% CI [46.2-74.8]) (71% in lab) of individuals whose sera tested positive with the ELISAs (figure 1). To explore whether this discrepancy was due to sample type (serum vs blood), or influenced by test operator (participant vs lab technician), we also tested four of the LFIAs with whole blood in lab (supplementary table iv).

        <p>Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) offer an important tool for widespread community screening of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. They have already been utilised for large regional and national seroprevalence surveys in the USA &amp; Europe 16,17,18 . However, to allow robust estimates of seroprevalence a better understanding is needed of (i) the performance of LFIAs in the general population, where most infected patients have not been hospitalised (and may have lower antibody responses associated with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic infection) 19,20,21 (ii) the performance of LFIAs in finger-prick self-testing and (iii) the reliability of LFIA user interpretation. Specificity of the rapid tests was high. For six (of nine) LFIAs assessed, specificity exceeded 98%, (the minimum standard recommended by MHRA for clinical use). All had sufficient specificity to be considered for seroprevalence studies. However, all eleven LFIAs assessed (in phase I and II) had lower sensitivity than reported in manufacturers' instructions, in comparison to either PCR-confirmed cases or laboratory ELISAs.Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) offer an important tool for widespread community screening of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.

        <p>Lower sensitivity than that reported by manufacturers could be explained by a number of factors. In contrast to previous studies 3,4,7 recruitment focussed on non-hospitalised participants, the majority of whom did not have severe symptoms. Antibody responses in this group may be of lower titre 22 . Of note, 5% of participants had no detectable antibody on either sensitive "in-house" immunoassay. Therefore, positivity on these assays was used as a reference for comparison. Recruiting patients at least 21 days after symptoms may be expected to improve sensitivity 23 .Median time from symptoms to recruitment here was 42 days. Whilst it is possible responses may be waning at this point, we did not see a difference in the mean strength of immune response in the "in house" immunoassays with increasing time since symptom onset (supplementary figure v). This provides some reassurance that antibody responses may be stable for up to 3 months, though this will be informed by emerging longitudinal data from individual patients 22 24 .Lower sensitivity than that reported by manufacturers could be explained by a number of factors. In contrast to previous studies 3,4,7 recruitment focussed on non-hospitalised participants, the majority of whom did not have severe symptoms. Antibody responses in this group may be of lower titre 22 . Of note, 5% of participants had no detectable antibody on either sensitive "in-house" immunoassay. Therefore, positivity on these assays was used as a reference for comparison. Recruiting patients at least 21 days after symptoms may be expected to improve sensitivity 23 .Median time from symptoms to recruitment here was 42 days.

        <p>Instructions for all the kits in this study advise that they are suitable for use with whole blood or serum. Two of the kits additionally recommend finger-prick testing. In general, the sensitivity of tests was similar when comparing results from sera or whole blood in the laboratory with that from finger-prick blood in clinic. However, this was not uniformly the case and one test had significantly superior sensitivity with serum (80%) than with whole blood (57%) or finger prick (22%) (table 4). Such sample discordance has also been described in other infections 25,26 .Instructions for all the kits in this study advise that they are suitable for use with whole blood or serum.

        <p>Overall, there was good agreement between self-reported results and those reported by an observer. The exception was for one test which differs in its design from the other LFIAs. It has a cylindrical plastic housing surrounding the lateral flow strip within which very faint lines were common and sometimes not reported by participants. It is possible this may be because these results were not routinely read against a white card which would normally be recommended. The data here supports the use of the other tests for self-administration, and potentially others like them, if detailed instructions are provided. However, it should be noted that although many participants were healthcare workers (from a range of areas including both clinical and non-clinical staff) they may not be representative of the general population. Further work is underway to assess the tests with a study group better representing the general population.Overall, there was good agreement between self-reported results and those reported by an observer.

        <p>It is not possible to generalise these findings to all LFIAs, particularly as manufacturers continue to develop better assays and housings. However, these results emphasise the need to evaluate new tests in the population of intended use and demonstrate that laboratory performance cannot be assumed to be a surrogate for finger-prick testing.It is not possible to generalise these findings to all LFIAs, particularly as manufacturers continue to develop better assays and housings.

        <p>In summary, this study describes a systematic approach to clinical testing of commercial LFIA kits. Based on a combination of kit usability, high specificity (98.6% (95% CI [97.1, 99.4])), moderate sensitivity (84% with fingerprick (95% CI [70.5, 93.5]), 88% with serum (95% CI [83. 3-91.2])), high PPV (87% (95% CI [76.9, 93.5])), moderate sample concordance (kappa 0.56 (95% CI [0.25, 0.86])) and availability for testing at scale, the Fortress test was selected for a further validation study in over 5000 police force personnel (REACT Study 4) and use in a large, nationally representative seroprevalence study. The REACT seroprevalence study commenced in England in June 2020. Further analysis of additional LFIAs from Phase II will be used to inform subsequent rounds of seroprevalence studies, as test performance continues to improve.
