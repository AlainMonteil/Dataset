        <p>The field of photovoltaics gives the opportunity to make our buildings ''smart'' and our portable devices "independent", provided effective energy sources can be developed for use in ambient indoor conditions. To address this important issue, ambient light photovoltaic cells were developed to power autonomous Internet of Things (IoT) devices, capable of machine learning, allowing the on-device implementation of artificial intelligence. Through a novel co-sensitization strategy, we tailored dyesensitized photovoltaic cells based on a copper(II/I) electrolyte for the generation of power under ambient lighting with an unprecedented conversion efficiency (34%, 103 mW cm À2 at 1000 lux; 32.7%, 50 mW cm À2 at 500 lux and 31.4%, 19 mW cm À2 at 200 lux from a fluorescent lamp). A small array of DSCs with a joint active area of 16 cm 2 was then used to power machine learning on wireless nodes.The field of photovoltaics gives the opportunity to make our buildings ''smart'' and our portable devices "independent", provided effective energy sources can be developed for use in ambient indoor conditions.

        <p>The collection of 0.947 mJ or 2.72 Â 10 15 photons is needed to compute one inference of a pre-trained artificial neural network for MNIST image classification in the employed set up. The inference accuracy of the network exceeded 90% for standard test images and 80% using camera-acquired printed MNISTdigits. Quantization of the neural network significantly reduced memory requirements with a less than 0.1% loss in accuracy compared to a full-precision network, making machine learning inferences on low-power microcontrollers possible. 152 J or 4.41 Â 10 20 photons required for training and verification of an artificial neural network were harvested with 64 cm 2 photovoltaic area in less than 24 hours under 1000 lux illumination. Ambient light harvesters provide a new generation of self-powered and "smart" IoT devices powered through an energy source that is largely untapped.The collection of 0.947 mJ or 2.72 Â 10 15 photons is needed to compute one inference of a pre-trained artificial neural network for MNIST image classification in the employed set up.

        <p>From conservation efforts and cleantech to tracking of environmental conditions and reductions in energy usage, every imaginable facet in the quest to reduce our carbon footprint is being explored anew through the IoT (Internet of Things). The IoT, as world-spanning networks of physical devices connected to the internet, marks an ever-growing eld of technology. Such networks of autonomous smart sensing devices are poised to advance the exchange of information in smart homes, offices, cities, and factories. [1][2][3][4] It is being argued that many aspects of our life will be mediated via 75 billion IoT devices by 2025, of which the majority will reside indoors. They will collect, communicate and process real-time data to optimize services and manufacturing processes, as well as to manage resources to reduce our energy consumption. 5,6 Most importantly towards broad implementation, such IoT devices have to become autonomous, which requires a local power source with low or even zero maintenance. Therefore, it is crucial to nd an energy source that yields high efficiencies in this environment.From conservation efforts and cleantech to tracking of environmental conditions and reductions in energy usage, every imaginable facet in the quest to reduce our carbon footprint is being explored anew through the IoT (Internet of Things).

        <p>In outdoor photovoltaics, a signicant portion of the sun's spectrum is found in the red region of the visible light and at near-infrared wavelengths, which suits the strong spectral response of crystalline silicon or GaAs-based solar cells in this wavelength domain. On the contrary, the largest part of indoor illumination spectra, most commonly originating from uorescent lamps, is found in the visible range between 400 and 650 nm. In this spectral region, diffuse ambient light provides universally available energy, which remains otherwise unused. [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] Photovoltaic technologies based on amorphous silicon (a-Si), [15][16][17] organic photovoltaics (OPV), 9,18,19 and dye sensitized cells (DSC) [20][21][22] have shown sufficient energy conversion in this region.In outdoor photovoltaics, a signicant portion of the sun's spectrum is found in the red region of the visible light and at near-infrared wavelengths, which suits the strong spectral response of crystalline silicon or GaAs-based solar cells in this wavelength domain.

        <p>DSCs are well known for their high performance in ambient light. In 2017, Freitag et al. introduced a new dye-sensitized solar cell design with Cu II/I (tmby) 2 (tmby ¼ 4,4 0 ,6,6 0 -tetramethyl-2,2 0 -bipyridine) as a redox relay, capable of successfully regenerating dyes at only 0.1 eV overpotential. Strikingly, under 1000 lux indoor illumination their solar to electrical power conversion efficiency was found to be 28.9%, outperforming conventional silicon and even GaAs based photovoltaics in ambient conditions and thus paving the path to applications in IoT devices. 20,23 To enable large area and sustainable production, the liquid electrolyte in DSCs needs to be replaced by a solid charge-transport material, however, current commonly used organic hole transport materials (such as spiro-MeOTAD) are limited in conductivity, stability and tunability. 24 Contrarily, copper coordination complex-based hole transport materials (HTMs) demonstrated a new concept for solid-state DSCs (ssDSCs) with a stable and record-breaking solar cell efficiency of 11.7%. 25 Considering the co-sensitization of dyes as a strategy to shape the TiO 2 /dye/electrolyte interface rather than the traditional approach of panchromatic extension of the spectral response, 26 we designed DSCs that maintain a high photovoltage specically under ambient light. Unfavourable electron back-transfers from the photoanode to the Cu II/I (tmby) 2 electrolyte are supressed, and as a result we recorded a photovoltage of 910 mV, translating into a PCE of 34.0%, 32.7% and 31.4% under 1000, 500 and 200 lux of uorescent light, respectively. Such photovoltaic conversion efficiencies deem DSCs the power sources of choice for IoT devices and wireless network sensors in ambient environments. IoT devices equipped with an array of these photovoltaic cells and a small energy buffer operate autonomously and therefore do not require long-term maintenance, such as battery replacements. 27 Further, the use of light-driven, autonomous devices leads to a paradigm shi of energy usage: unlike battery-supported systems, which contribute to 10 billion dry-cell batteries produced annually, all surrounding energy can be harvested and used to the maximum of its availability. 28 Implementing articial intelligence directly on-device bene-ts such IoT sensor networks to a large extent (Fig. 1). IoT devices with pre-trained articial neural networks (ANN) can directly infer or classify information about their surroundings, rather than communicating information through wireless networks. Reduction of the overall communication in the network is benecial especially upon execution of heavy computational tasks such as advanced image recognition. [29][30][31][32] As an additional advantage, on-device machine learning enables IoT devices to adapt to changing environments. In particular, they can self-optimize their energy consumption, perform demanding computations when ambient light is strongest and adaptive sleep during other times. [33][34][35] Therefore, the combination of machine learning, environmental sensing, and photovoltaic cells as power sources lead to benecial synergies.

On the transmitter side, adaptive sleep was implemented using a PID-loop, using the internal voltage of the microcontroller as a set point. 2500 mV was selected as a set point for the internal voltage. Values for the proportional (K p ), integral (K i ) and derivative (K d ) terms were experimentally evaluated and were the same for all experiments (K p ¼ 1, K i ¼ 0.05, K d ¼ 0.05). Intermittent sleep intervals were multiples of 10 seconds, with a maximum of 240 sleep cycles (i.e. 40 minutes).

        <p>Co-sensitization of dyes to extend the photoresponse of DSCs has been studied intensively throughout the literature (Fig. 2A). High solar cell performances are commonly achieved by a spectral combination of the broad photocurrent collection of small-transition-energy dyes with the large photovoltage generated by dyes with a large transition energy. Towards ambient light conversion, however, there are several other factors to consider. First, the spectral conversion response of the DSC should be judiciously tuned to the source of ambient lighting rather than aiming for a sole broadening of the absorption domain. 20 Secondly, at low light intensities, the suppression of recombination processes plays a crucial role in the DSC performance. To avoid undesired back-transfers of electrons aer their injection into the TiO 2 conduction band, the adsorbed dyes need to protect the TiO 2 surface from electronic interaction with the electrolyte. 48 In particular, copper coordination complexes are known to show high recombination rates with electrons in the FTO and TiO 2 in comparison to their cobalt-based counterparts.Co-sensitization of dyes to extend the photoresponse of DSCs has been studied intensively throughout the literature (Fig. 2A).

        <p>Strikingly, the photovoltage of the co-sensitized DSCs largely exceeded the photovoltage generated by either dye alone. Devices based on sensitizer XY1 reached 1000 mV whereas the yellow L1 dye, despite the larger transition energy E 0-0 of 2.64 eV, only generated a V OC of 910 mV. In such case of a single sensitizer, the oxidized species of the redox mediator, here Cu II (tmby) 2 , can approach uncovered spots on the TiO 2 and FTO surface and lead to electron recombination. The two sensitizers used in this study complement each other sterically in terms of TiO 2 surface coverage due to the large difference in molecule size (Fig. S1 †). The much smaller L1 dye molecules can occupy the surface area between larger XY1 molecules. As a result, a denser monolayer is formed, which passivates the surfaces of FTO and TiO 2 . Consequently, electron back-transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band or FTO surface to the redox mediator is suppressed. Long electron lifetimes across the TiO 2 /XY1:L1/ Cu II/I (tmby) 2 interface further conrm supressed recombination in the co-sensitized DSCs (Fig. 3 and S4 †). 48,49 Due to the large electronic transition energy in the L1 dye, a larger quantity of high-energetic electrons is injected into the TiO 2 conduction band, thus raising the TiO 2 Fermi energy. As a consequence, the open-circuit voltage of the cell increased to 1080 mV. Lowering the illumination to 10% sunlight causes a small drop in the V OC of XY1:L1-sensitized solar cells to 980 mV, while leading to an increase in PCE up to 13.7% (Fig. 2B and Table S1Strikingly, the photovoltage of the co-sensitized DSCs largely exceeded the photovoltage generated by either dye alone.

We equipped the board with a AVX 6.0 V 0.47 F supercapacitor to serve as an energy buffer (Fig. S10 †) and a rectifying diode to prevent capacitor discharging into the cells during dark intervals. Fig. S11B † shows an example of the charging curve of a serial array of photovoltaic cells (total 25.6 cm 2 ) charging energy into a AVX 5.5 V 1.5 F supercapacitor. The microcontroller was congured at 8 MHz, which allows for an operating voltage of 1.8-5.5 V. Wireless communication was established through a low-power nRF24L01+ transceiver. For detailed information the reader is referred to Fig. S10. † All benchmarks executed a workload inside a PID-control loop using the internal microcontroller voltage (which is equivalent to the capacitor voltage) as a set point, determining intermittent sleep intervals. In addition to MNIST machine learning inference, three benchmarks were executed as core workloads: heartbeat for continuous wireless communication, Dhrystone MIPS for assessment of computational performance assessment, and temperature sensing for day-night testing. 62,65 All benchmarks were executed on fully untethered harvesters and results were wirelessly transmitted to a power-connected base station. The transmitted 12 byte serialized data package contained information about the package length, a package identier, internal voltage, sensor data, message count, and the number of sleep cycles.</p>
        <p>The heartbeat benchmark contained no sensor data and executed no further workload. Data was continuously sent at 282 ms per data package, of which 250 ms were an intentional sleep interval, giving an effective execution time of 32 ms. The internal voltage increased to an equilibrium between energy harvest and consumption, determined by the increased power consumption of the microcontroller at higher operating voltages, slower energy charging of the buffer and general leakage.The heartbeat benchmark contained no sensor data and executed no further workload.

        <p>The Dhrystone MIPS benchmark was used in an adapted version in order to be executable on the microcontroller. The average VAX MIPS were calculated on-chip and included the calculated sleep time. An average computational performance of 0.413 VAX MIPS was recorded over a period of 24 hours. During that period, a total of 19 hours 52 minutes of sleep was protocolled, leading to an effective 4 hours 8 minutes or 17% active runtime of the microcontroller under full CPU-load.The Dhrystone MIPS benchmark was used in an adapted version in order to be executable on the microcontroller.

        <p>Machine learning capabilities were benchmarked using a pre-trained two-layer network to categorize images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which were received wirelessly. Inferences were averaged over 100 computations before transmission. The computation of each inference consumed 0.947 mJ of energy in our pilot experiment, translating to 2.72 Â 10 15 photons or 4.51 Â 10 À9 einstein per inference and pose an important benchmark for future approaches. 16 cm 2 of photovoltaic area provided sufficient energy for one inference within just 581 ms of 1000 lux illumination.Machine learning capabilities were benchmarked using a pre-trained two-layer network to categorize images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which were received wirelessly.

        <p>We extended the benchmark to a simulated day-night indoor environment with 16 hours of 1000 lux illumination and 8 hours of darkness for twelve days, measuring the temperature as workload (Fig. 6). As an initial observation, the operating voltage on the microcontroller exhibits the same pattern of voltage decay during dark periods and voltage rise under illumination for the duration of the entire experiment. As a result, we conclude that the DSCs provide a constant amount of energy and exhibit excellent stability under 1000 lux illumination. On average, the wireless sensor transmitted data every 16 seconds during illumination intervals, well-ranging within common battery-driven wireless sensors. During 'night' intervals, the microcontroller used the energy stored in the AVX 6.0 V 0.47 F supercapacitor to ensure data transmission to the base station in intervals of minutes. The microcontroller operated continuously without shutting down, thus removing the requirement to save data to non-volatile memory.We extended the benchmark to a simulated day-night indoor environment with 16 hours of 1000 lux illumination and 8 hours of darkness for twelve days, measuring the temperature as workload (Fig. 6).

        <p>While 1000 lux was chosen as a standard premise for this feasibility study, in many cases indoor IoT devices will not be illuminated with more than 200-500 lux (Fig. S3B † and Table 1). 14,66 Nonetheless, as demonstrated in this pilot example, the operation at an equilibrium between execution of computational load and intermittent sleep cycles ensures that the IoT device adapts to the available light energy. It is without question worth noting that, certainly at illumination intensities dropping below 200 lux, the array of photovoltaic cells will slow down certain core computational workloads such as the energyconsuming training of an articial neural network. Nonetheless, the large photovoltage of 840 mV at 200 lux allows the photovoltaic cells to provide a voltage within the operating range of many microcontrollers even at such low light intensities. Meanwhile, the harvested photocurrents follow a linear dependency on the intensity of illumination. As a result, the photovoltaic cells will continue to steadily charge the energy buffer.While 1000 lux was chosen as a standard premise for this feasibility study, in many cases indoor IoT devices will not be illuminated with more than 200-500 lux (Fig. S3B † and Table 1). 14,66 Nonetheless, as demonstrated in this pilot example, the operation at an equilibrium between execution of computational load and intermittent sleep cycles ensures that the IoT device adapts to the available light energy.

        <p>As a communicating and autonomous system of interconnected devices, a self-powered IoT embodies technological sustainability. An enhanced exchange of light and information in intelligent wireless sensor networks looks poised to transform the implementation of IoT devices. Through elimination of recombinative electron transfers across the photoactive interface, dye-sensitized solar cells based on dyes XY1 and L1 maintain over 910 mV of photovoltage under 1000 lux of uorescent light, translating into 34.0%, 32.7% and 31.4% conversion efficiency at 1000, 500 and 200 lux of uorescent light. Employing small arrays of photovoltaic cells, core workloads of IoT devices such as sensing and wireless communication were benchmarked. The possibility of inferring information from learned models was tested through the implementation of an articial neural network: In our experimental set up, 152 J or 4.41 Â 10 20 photons were required to train and verify an articial neural network; 0.947 mJ or 2.72 Â 10 15 photons were subsequently required to compute one inference.As a communicating and autonomous system of interconnected devices, a self-powered IoT embodies technological sustainability.
