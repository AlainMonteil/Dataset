        <p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a class of metallic materials that have revolutionized alloy design. They are known for their high compressive strengths, often greater than 1 GPa; however, the tensile strengths of most reported HEAs are limited. Here, we report a strategy for the design and fabrication of HEAs that can achieve ultrahigh tensile strengths. The proposed strategy involves the introduction of a high density of hierarchical intragranular nanoprecipitates. To establish the validity of this strategy, we designed and fabricated a bulk Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA to consist of a principal face-centered cubic (fcc) phase containing hierarchical intragranular nanoprecipitates. Our results show that precipitation strengthening, as one of the main strengthening mechanisms, contributes to a tensile yield strength ( 0.2 ) of ~1.86 GPa and an ultimate tensile strength of ~2.52 GPa at room temperature, which heretofore represents the highest strength reported for an HEA with an appreciable failure strain of ~5.2%.High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a class of metallic materials that have revolutionized alloy design.

        <p>The traditional alloy design concept combines one or two principal elements with additional minor elements, an approach that restricts the development and application of alloys due to the limited compositional space explored (1). Thus, to enable the pursuit of alloys with special microstructures and properties, such as high strength, new design concepts are needed. Recently, a brand new class of metallic materials that consists of at least five principal elements, each contributing 5 to 35 atomic % (at %) referred to as multi-principal element alloys or high-entropy alloys (HEAs), has attracted worldwide attention (2,3). HEAs have unique combinations of properties that are not attainable in conventional alloys, including high strength and hardness, excellent resistance to high-temperature softening, unique magnetic properties, superior corrosion and oxidation resistance, strong fatigue resistance, attractive tribological properties, good creep resistance, excellent irradiation tolerance, high thermal stability, and superior mechanical performance at cryogenic temperatures (2,(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11).The traditional alloy design concept combines one or two principal elements with additional minor elements, an approach that restricts the development and application of alloys due to the limited compositional space explored (1).

        <p>HEAs have simple random solid solutions rather than ordered and/or intermetallic phases; partly due to a high entropy of mixing (high-entropy effect), which notably reduces the Gibbs free energy of mixing (2,3). Solid-solution phases reported in HEAs generally include five types of phases; that is, disordered face-centered cubic (fcc, A1), disordered body-centered cubic (bcc, A2), ordered fcc (L1 2 ), ordered bcc (B2), and hexagonal close-packed (hcp, A3) (2,12,13). HEAs can be classified as single-and multiphase HEAs. Despite the maximized configurational entropy of mixing in singlephase HEAs compared to those of multiphase HEAs, single-phase HEAs usually exhibit disappointing mechanical property combinations. For instance, single-phase fcc-structured HEAs show outstand-ing ductility with low strength (14), and single-phase bcc-structured HEAs have high strength but low ductility (15). Inspection of the published literature reveals that a number of strategies have emerged in an effort to design multiphase HEAs that contain both ductile and strong phases (16,17). Here, we report on the design and fabrication of an Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA that contains a ductile fcc matrix with a small volume fraction of a strong interdispersed bcc phase.HEAs have simple random solid solutions rather than ordered and/or intermetallic phases; partly due to a high entropy of mixing (high-entropy effect), which notably reduces the Gibbs free energy of mixing (2,3).

        <p>Different strengthening mechanisms, such as phase transformation strengthening, solid-solution strengthening, dislocation strengthening, grain-boundary strengthening, precipitation strengthening, and load transfer via the introduction of strong phases, can be used to achieve high strength/hardness in multiphase HEAs (18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30). Of these, load transfer and precipitation strengthening are considered to be the two most effective strengthening mechanisms. Excessive amounts of strong phases lead to a notable decrease in ductility or even failure before yielding during mechanical testing (25). Precipitates are often observed in HEAs when a significantly positive enthalpy of mixing (or significantly negative enthalpy of formation of intermetallic phases) cannot be counteracted by a high entropy of mixing (17,27,28). A dispersion of coherent ′ precipitates in the  matrix in some Al-and/or Ti-containing HEAs leads to high strength/hardness at room temperature and at high temperatures (17,27,28,31).Different strengthening mechanisms, such as phase transformation strengthening, solid-solution strengthening, dislocation strengthening, grain-boundary strengthening, precipitation strengthening, and load transfer via the introduction of strong phases, can be used to achieve high strength/hardness in multiphase HEAs (18)(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30).

        <p>Precipitates in HEAs usually contain multiple principal elements (27,28). Two interesting questions arise: (i) Can a hierarchical architecture involving nanoprecipitates be formed in HEAs; that is, can some secondary nanoprecipitates form inside these primary nanoprecipitates consisting of multi-principal elements? (ii) Can an ultrahigh strength be achieved as a result of the high density of intragranular nanoprecipitates with such a hierarchical architecture? Here, we design a novel Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA based on the fcc single-phase equiatomic FeCoNi medium-entropy alloy in which two elements, Al and Ti, are added (14). Al and Ti tend to form intermetallic phases with Fe, Ni, and Co, which have remarkably high mutual solubility with each other, and accordingly, the addition of Al and Ti into an FeCoNi alloy is anticipated to form a high density of intragranular nanoprecipitates having multiple principal elements.

        <p>without additional complex phases, empirical conditions of Ω ≥ 1.1 and  ≤ 6.6% should be satisfied at minimum, where Ω is an indicator of the stability of the multicomponent solid solution and  is the atomic size difference of the component elements (32,33). In the meantime, Ω infinitely approaching the threshold value of 1.1 would potentially lead to the formation of secondary precipitates. Thus, the chemical composition of Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 with Ω = 1.119 and  = 6.277 was designed from this concept (see the supplementary materials for more details on the design strategy). Thus far, bulk HEAs have been predominantly fabricated by casting, during which phase separation may occur. Here, we synthesize a bulk Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA by mechanical alloying (MA) followed by consolidation via spark plasma sintering (SPS). We show that a bulk Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA exhibits a primary fcc phase with a small amount of bcc phase based on x-ray diffraction (XRD). The fcc matrix () is reinforced by a very high density of intragranular nanoprecipitates (′) in which significantly finer secondary nanoprecipitates (*) are present. Note that the symbol * designated herein is only used to differentiate ′ and * nanoprecipitates and to show the relationship between ′ and * nanoprecipitates. The , ′, and * phases exhibit A1, L1 2 , and A1 structures with very similar lattice parameter, respectively. The high density of hierarchical intragranular nanoprecipitates in the bulk Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA results in an ultrahigh strength, one of the highest strengths reported to date for HEAs.

        <p>As shown in Fig. 1A, the XRD pattern reveals that the bulk Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA is composed of a primary fcc phase (~82.3 volume %) and a small amount of bcc phase (~17.7 volume %), which is confirmed by the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) phase map in Fig. 1C. The EBSD inverse pole figure (IPF) in Fig. 1D corresponding to the EBSD phase map in Fig. 1C indicates that, inside the fcc grains, there are some unidentified phases, which correspond to a high density of hierarchical intragranular nanoprecipitates, as we will show hereinafter. Note that there are no precipitates in the bcc phase. On the basis of numerous transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and EBSD maps, grain diameters of the fcc phase and of the bcc phase were measured. The statistical grain diameter distribution, presented in Fig. 1B, indicates that the diameters of the fcc grains range from several nanometers to 1200 nm, while those of the bcc grains are in the range of several nanometers to 700 nm. In addition, average diameters for the fcc phase and for the bcc phase are ~409 and ~227 nm, respectively.As shown in Fig. 1A, the XRD pattern reveals that the bulk Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA is composed of a primary fcc phase (~82.3 volume %) and a small amount of bcc phase (~17.7 volume %), which is confirmed by the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) phase map in Fig. 1C.

        <p>In the bright-field TEM image shown in Fig. 2A, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the [011] zone axis corresponding to grain a presented in the lower left inset exhibits reflections of an ordered fcc (L1 2 structure), and the SAED pattern of the [001] zone axis corresponding to grain b presented in the upper right inset exhibits reflections of an ordered bcc (B2 structure). Evidently, a high density of nanoprecipitates can be seen in grain a. Figure 2B shows that high densities of ′ nanoprecipitates are present inside the fcc phase. In addition, the scanning TEM (STEM) image of grain I in fig. S1 further confirms the presence of nanoprecipitates inside the fcc grains. Figure 2C shows the presence of some secondary * precipitates (as indicated by arrows), several nanometers to tens of nanometers in size, in the ′ precipitate. Also, there are twins present in some fcc grains such as grain c in Fig. 2A. In addition, fig. S2 confirms the presence of twins in additional fcc grains. It is not surprising that twinning can occur in these grains, which may arise from the nature of fcc-structured phases in HEAs, which usually exhibit low stacking fault energy (11,13,30). It is argued that the twins observed in the sintered HEAs are likely deformation twins retained from milled powders and/or annealing twins generated during the SPS process (34). Note that precipitates or twins were not observed in the bcc phase. A schematic diagram of the microstructure of the bulk Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA is illustrated in Fig. 2D, showing that the fcc phase (, blue) contains hierarchical intragranular precipitates, i.e., the primary ′ precipitates (orange) and the secondary * precipitates (white); however, there are no precipitates in the bcc grains (yellow).In the bright-field TEM image shown in Fig. 2A, the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the [011] zone axis corresponding to grain a presented in the lower left inset exhibits reflections of an ordered fcc (L1 2 structure), and the SAED pattern of the [001] zone axis corresponding to grain b presented in the upper right inset exhibits reflections of an ordered bcc (B2 structure).

        <p>Figure S1C shows the statistical distribution of the spacing between two adjacent ′ nanoprecipitates, which ranges from several nanometers to ~45 nm, and the statistical ′ nanoprecipitate diameter distribution ranging from ~20 to ~100 nm. Estimated average values of the ′ nanoprecipitate's diameter and the spacing between adjacent ′ nanoprecipitates are 57 and 11 nm, respectively. In addition, the estimated volume fraction of ′ nanoprecipitates in the fcc phase is ~62 volume %, and therefore, the total volume fraction of ′ nanoprecipitates in the bulk Fe 25 S1. Chemical compositions of the bcc phase and fcc phase ( + ′ + *) were obtained by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in TEM, whereas chemical compositions of the fcc  matrix and ′ precipitates were measured by EDS in STEM. The bcc phase is an Al-Ti-rich phase, and the fcc phase ( + ′ + *) is an Al-Ti-depleted phase, which is consistent with high contents of Al and Ti favoring the formation of bcc-structured phases in HEAs (8,12,16). Furthermore, the fcc  matrix is an Fe-(Co,Ni)-based solid-solution phase with some Al and Ti, and the ′ precipitate is a (Ni,Co) 3 -(Ti,Al)-based intermetallic phase with some Fe present. Note that the chemical composition of * precipitates has not been obtained because of their very small sizes.Figure S1C shows the statistical distribution of the spacing between two adjacent ′ nanoprecipitates, which ranges from several nanometers to ~45 nm, and the statistical ′ nanoprecipitate diameter distribution ranging from ~20 to ~100 nm.

        <p>Precipitation strengthening occurs by two mechanisms: the shearing mechanism or the Orowan bypass mechanism, depending on many factors, including the precipitate size, coherency, antiphase boundary (APB) energy, and strength (or hardness) of the precipitate (35). We first discuss crystal structures and coherency of the fcc  matrix, the primary ′ precipitate, and the secondary * precipitate in the fcc phase. Figure 4 shows high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the fcc phase containing hierarchical intragranular nanoprecipitates. Figure 4A displays a schematic diagram of the detailed microstructure of coherently hierarchical nanoprecipitates in the fcc phase, where dashed lines in Fig. 4A denote that the  matrix, ′ precipitates, and * precipitates are coherent, which will be discussed hereinafter. An HRTEM image containing the  matrix and two ′ precipitates (marked as precipitates 1 and 2, respectively) inside the fcc grain is shown in Fig. 4B. Figure 4C shows the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) of the square area in the  matrix (Fig. 4B), with its corresponding FFT presented in the inset, and the FFT corresponds to an SAED pattern along the [011] zone axis of a disordered fcc (A1) structure with a lattice parameter of ~3.601 Å. The IFFT of the ′ precipitate 1 in Fig. 4B is displayed in Fig. 4D with corresponding FFT presented in the inset; the FFT corresponds to an SAED pattern along the [011] zone axis of an ordered fcc (L1 2 ) structure with a lattice parameter of ~3.605 Å. This suggests that the  matrix and the ′ precipitate have an orientation relationship of &lt;011&gt;  ∥ &lt;011&gt; ′ and {111}  ∥ {111} ′ . Figure 4E presents a bright-field TEM image of the , ′, and * phases, and an HRTEM image of the circled area in Fig. 4E is shown in Fig. 4F, which reveals the interface between ′ and * precipitates. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 4G, the FFT of the ′ precipitate suggests an ordered L1 2 structure with a lattice parameter of ~3.605 Å; however, Fig. 4H shows that the FFT of the * precipitate suggests a disordered A1 structure with a lattice parameter of ~3.601 Å.

        <p>the ′ precipitate displays an ordered L1 2 structure, with approximately identical lattice parameters. Hence, the , ′, and * phases exhibit very similar crystal structures and have almost identical lattice parameters, which explains why XRD can only identify one fcc crystal structure, as is the cases in many HEAs (12,13,17). In summary, we conclude that the fcc  matrix is an A1-structured Fe-(Co,Ni)-based solid-solution phase, the ′ precipitate is a L1 2structured (Ni,Co) 3 -(Ti,Al)-based intermetallic phase, and the * precipitate is an A1-structured phase with an undetected composition.the ′ precipitate displays an ordered L1 2 structure, with approximately identical lattice parameters.

        <p>The shearing mechanism will be active when a precipitate with small size is coherent, whereas the Orowan bypass mechanism occurs preferentially when the precipitate is incoherent (27,28,35). Since ′ and * precipitates are coherent with the  matrix and ′ precipitates have an average diameter of ~57 nm, shearing is suspected to be the operative mechanism. To obtain direct evidence of this mechanism, in situ compression tests were carried out in the TEM at room temperature. The recorded test (movie S1) reveals that dislocations do in fact shear ′ precipitates. Figure S4 presents sequential snapshots from the movie that track the motion of dislocations with arrows. The dislocations first generated in the  matrix propagate through the ′ precipitates, which implies that shearing of the precipitate has occurred as opposed to the Orowan bypass mechanism. As dislocations shear the precipitate, the dislocation motion is hindered, leading to accumulation of dislocations in ′ precipitates. It is expected that dislocations also shear coherent * precipitates as they traverse the ′ precipitate. The observation of the abovementioned dynamic process during the in situ TEM compression test suggests that the shearing mechanism is also active in room temperature tensile testing. Hence, it is anticipated that a relatively high stress will be needed for the shearing mechanism of both of ′ and * precipitates, thereby leading to an exceptional precipitation strengthening. In addition to precipitation strength-ening, other strengthening mechanisms are believed to contribute to the ultrahigh strength measured. Because of submicrometer grain sizes, 409 and 227 nm for the fcc and bcc phase, respectively, grainboundary strengthening is likely to occur (23,34). Furthermore, the bcc phase with ordered B2 structure is usually considered as a hard/ strong phase that can result in a high increment in yield strength due to a load transfer mechanism (13,36).The shearing mechanism will be active when a precipitate with small size is coherent, whereas the Orowan bypass mechanism occurs preferentially when the precipitate is incoherent (27,28,35).

        <p>To provide insight into the strength of the material presented in this work, the tensile strength versus failure strain is plotted in Fig. 5 alongside other HEAs that exhibit high strength (yield strength and tensile strength both greater than 1 GPa) (19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30). The performance of these HEAs is attributed to complex microstructures achieved by various processing routes outlined in table S2. Note that most of reported HEAs have yield strengths and tensile strengths less than 1 GPa, falling outside the range of mechanical performance presented in Fig. 5. Specifically, for HEAs processed by cold rolling/cryo rolling and high-pressure torsion, high strengths are mainly attributed to dislocation strengthening and grain-boundary strengthening, as well as the presence of strong B2 and/or  phases (19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)(25). Grainboundary strengthening and dispersion strengthening mainly account for the strengthening mechanisms of the Ni 1.5 Co 1.5 CrFeTi 0.5 HEA with fine grains and oxide contaminants (30). The high strength of the as-cast bcc TaHZrTi refractory HEA is due to the high-load transfer ability of bcc refractory HEAs (29). The strengthening mechanism in the precipitation-strengthened HEAs is dominated by the shearing mechanism (26,28). The uniqueness of precipitation strengthening in the Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA is due to the hierarchical precipitate spatial distribution, which is not found in precipitation-strengthened HEAs reported in the literature. In previously reported HEAs, dislocations only need to shear coherent ′ precipitates (26,28). Here, dislocations must shear both the ′ (primary precipitates) and the * (secondary nanoprecipitates). * nanoprecipitates act as an additional obstacle, which results in an exaggerated precipitation strengthening effect. As shown in Fig. 5, compared to data reported in the literature, the Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA exhibits the highest tensile strength with an appreciable failure strain (~5.2%) at room temperature, suggesting that the proposed strategy in this work is valid due to the strengthening mechanisms previously discussed.To provide insight into the strength of the material presented in this work, the tensile strength versus failure strain is plotted in Fig. 5 alongside other HEAs that exhibit high strength (yield strength and tensile strength both greater than 1 GPa) (19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30).

        <p>Upon inspection of the fracture surface generated from in situ SEM microtensile testing (fig. S5), both faceted and dimpled regions are present, corresponding to brittle and ductile failure, respectively. Evidently, plastic deformation of the alloy occurs primarily through the ductile fcc phase, which has the aforementioned hierarchical architecture. Dislocation accumulation/storage is enhanced inside the fcc grains due to the presence of hierarchical intragranular nanoprecipitates, which may result in enhanced strain hardening and improved ductility (37) relative to other reported HEAs. This proposed mechanism accounts for the appreciable work hardening and failure strain of ~5.2% exhibited by the Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA under tension at room temperature.Upon inspection of the fracture surface generated from in situ SEM microtensile testing (fig.

        <p>Hierarchical intragranular nanoprecipitates in HEAs were attained through MA followed by SPS. The synthesis of HEAs by MA results in remarkably extended solid solubility, and therefore, supersaturated solid solutions may be formed in the as-milled HEA powders (30,34). Subsequently, the formation of more equilibrated phases occurs during consolidation at elevated temperature (12,30,34). The 49-hour milled Fe 25 Co 25 Ni 25 Al 10 Ti 15 HEA powders are supersaturated solid solutions consisting of a primary bcc phase and a small amount of fcc phase (see fig. S6). However, following SPS, the bulk sample exhibits a primary fcc phase (containing hierarchical intragranular nanoprecipitates) and a minor bcc phase. The primary ′ nanoprecipitates have multiple principal elements; they are (Ni,Co) 3 -(Ti,Al)-based phase and may have some other constituent elements such as Fe. As a result, some secondary * nanoprecipitates precipitate from the primary ′ nanoprecipitates during the late stage of sintering. The * nanoprecipitates may form through phase separation mechanism during the cooling process of SPS, which can be understood by performing Scheil-Gulliver nonequilibrium model-ing, as shown in fig. S7 (38,39). It is not uncommon to observe nanoscale phase separation upon cooling of HEAs, since the diffusion of some species in HEAs may be limited, and thus promoting nanoscale phase separation within the matrix (12,31,36). The nonequilibrium thermodynamic modeling indicates that, along with the major species, Fe is within the fcc-structured * phase, which is consistent with the EDS analysis.Hierarchical intragranular nanoprecipitates in HEAs were attained through MA followed by SPS.
