        <p>The purpose of this paper is to review the present knowledge on ash formation, ash particle transport and deposition during solid fuel combustion, with emphasis on particle sticking and rebound behavior. A substantial part of the fuel can be inorganic, forming inorganic vapors and ash particles. The impaction of solid, molten or partially molten particles on surfaces is dependent on the particle and surface characteristics. For instance, a particulate deposit might capture incoming particles or be removed due to erosion, while a molten layer will collect all impacting particles, no matter if they are sticky or not. The main properties affecting the particle stickiness are the viscosity and surface tension for silicate-rich ashes. On the contrary, the stickiness of salt-rich ashes À typical for herbaceous biomass and wood-or waste-based fuels À is often described using the liquid melt fraction. Furthermore, the particle kinetic energy and the angle of impaction, are crucial parameters. If all kinetic energy is dissipated during the impact, the particle will remain on the surface. This review presents an overview of major ash forming elements found in biomass and coal, and discusses the heterogeneity of particles' inorganic composition. Ash transport and deposition mechanisms as well as their mathematical description are given and discussed, together with composition-and temperature-depended models for the estimation of ash particle and deposit properties. These properties are essential in order to describe the particle sticking and rebound behavior. Ash particle sticking and rebound criteria can be divided into three main groups, based on either: (1) the particle melt fraction, (2) the particle viscosity, or (3) the energy dissipation of a particle, upon impaction. Sticking criteria are presented, their required parameters are discussed and typical particle and surface properties found in combustion systems, are summarized. Eight different sticking criteria are implemented in a computational fluid dynamics code and computations are compared against measurements from an entrained flow reactor. Uniform sized soda-lime glass particles are applied instead of inhomogeneous fly ash particles, since soda-lime glass is known to behave similar to coal fly ash. Best agreement for the deposition rates on a clean tube is achieved using a criterion based on the work of Srinivasachar et al. [1]. In this model, the sticking and rebound threshold, is a function of the particle kinetic energy, the angle of impaction, and, the particle viscosity. Particularly, the particle viscosity is confirmed as a key parameter for silicate-rich ashes. It should be calculated using temperature-and composition-dependent correlations, being aware that there is a significant scattering in the results from such models and that the models are often only valid in narrow compositional ranges, and cannot be used outside these. A mechanistic model is used to explain results from glass particle experiments and their dependence on the particle kinetic energy. Therefore, the impaction process is subdivided in four steps, and the energy dissipation of each step is calculated. These theoretical considerations show that the contact angle of a molten droplet with the substrate is of minor importance, and that the majority of depositing particles are dominated by the work of deformation against viscosity, rather than surface tension effects. This review underlines the importance of the particle viscosity, and its accurate prediction for silicate-rich ashes. The proposed criterion is able to predict the sticking of small, solid particles below 10 mm diameter, as it is often observed in literature. Also, it is crucial to consider the surface structure and stickiness, in order to predict deposition rates in solid fuel-fired systems. Biomass ashes and their stickiness are more difficult, due to a different ash particle chemistry, compared to coal ashes.

        <p>T a g g e d P Through several years, high-quality research has been conducted to characterize fuels [2À6], investigate fuel conversion and ash formation [7À11], as well as ashes and deposit formation in utility boilers fired with coal, biomass and waste fractions [12À20]. Huge amounts of experimental data have been gained, but the fact is that there are still in 2017, a number of big gaps in our current understanding of ash and deposit formation in utility boilers, and that we need to focus strongly on these points, in order to be able to describe, understand and quantify the process of deposit formation completely. Many high-quality data are available on the release of critical ash-forming elements, although most of the lab-scale measurements are performed under experimental conditions different from what happens in full-scale. The main difference being the particle size distribution of the fuels investigated, and the time-temperature history, mainly the heat-up rate and final temperature, experienced by the fuel particles. Further important differences between small-scale setups and furnace environments are particle concentrations affecting particle dynamics and particle formation by condensation, as well as the fact that drop tube studies are often conducted with high excess air and low gas velocities. Both, particle concentration and excess air, are crucial explaining partial vaporization, e.g. of alkali metals. Fly ash formation has been intensively studied for coal combustion, where the fly ash size distribution has a multi-modal size distribution [21À23].

D 1 9 4 X XSub-micron particles on the contrary, originate mainly from homogeneous nucleation, and subsequent coagulation of flame-volatilized inorganic species. Other important processes going on include fragmentation of chars and mineral inclusions as well as coalescence of ash droplets on receding char surfaces. A number of basic mechanisms of ash species transport has been outlined and quantified in the literature during the last 20 years, but a very crucial aspect of ash deposition, the process when an ash particle impacts on a heat exchanging surface, is often not addressed or discussed in detail. There is a lack of a comprehensive review in the field of ash particle sticking and rebound behavior and a comparison of different sticking criteria in terms of accuracy and performance. In this field, many publications use inappropriate models underlining the necessity of a review. Therefore, this paper summarizes ash formation and deposition mechanisms, discusses the differences between biomass and coal, and presents a critical literature review on ash particle sticking and rebound criteria.

Section 2 provides the fundamentals of solid fuel combustion systems, inorganic constituents in solid fuels, ash formation, fly ash particles and their classification, deposit formation mechanisms as well as an overview on the effect of deposits on heat transfer. It is a summary of major T a g g e d P literature references, however, due to the enormous amount of studies in this wide field, it is not possible to include all findings. Section 3 gives mathematical models for the estimation of particle and deposit properties. These properties are required in order to describe the ash particle stickiness.

        <p>T a g g e d P Solid fuel combustion has been subject to research for more than 100 years. But still today there are many unresolved problems and phenomena, which are not understood in detail. Many existing mathematical models describing solid fuel conversion are empirical in nature and fitted towards measurements. One of the main reasons is the heterogeneity and complex chemical structure of solid fuels and their changes during thermal conversion. Fuel conversion in combustion systems involves homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions, changing particle structures entrained in a turbulent flow combined with radiative heat transfer. The complex interaction of these phenomena, is the main difficulty in understanding and modeling such systems.T a g g e d P Solid fuel combustion has been subject to research for more than 100 years.

The complex interaction of these phenomena, is the main difficulty in understanding and modeling such systems.</p>
        <p>T a g g e d P Typical solid fuel combustion systems are illustrated and compared in Fig. 1. They comprise of three main types: grate combustion, fluidized bed (FB) combustion and pulverized fuel (PF) combustion systems. Characteristics of each boiler type are summarized underneath each schematic. The main difference among boiler types are boiler size, fuel quality, fuel processing before combustion, fuel-oxidizer ratio, gas flow conditions as well as temperatures. T a g g e d P Pulverized fuel boilers are the most commonly built systems for power generation from coal. Pulverized fuel, with a typical particle size smaller than 200 mm, is transported with preheated air or recirculated flue gas to the burner and into the furnace. Particles heat up, release combustible gases and react with oxygen, forming flue gas. The flue gas is transported with the remaining ash particles through the combustion chamber. Boiler walls and tubes inside the combustion system act as heat exchanging surfaces, where heat is transferred from the flue gas to the water-steam cycle. PF systems are designed in a way that combustion is completed before the flue gas reaches the first convective heat exchanger in the form of tube banks. This ensures lower temperatures of remaining fly ash particles, compared to burning particles, and thus a reduced threat of molten, sticky ash particles adhering to heat exchanging surfaces. There are studies indicating that char particles burn at temperatures up to 300 K higher than the surrounding flue gas [24]. A critical parameter, when designing the furnace and its height, is the ash softening and ash melting temperature. The furnace exit gas temperature should stay below the ash softening temperature. However, this criterion can also fail. There are studies reporting up to 50% of melt in the ash system at the ash softening temperature [25,26]. In this case, there can be excessive deposit formation, even though the furnace exit gas temperature is below the ash softening temperature. The main difficulty in boiler design is to achieve a high level of burnout, while staying below the ash softening temperature. This is challenging, since nowadays, fuel and load flexibility become more and more important. Within combustion systems, ash deposition is T a g g e d P often defined as either slagging or fouling. Slagging occurs in the furnace area, where heat exchanging surfaces are exposed directly to flame radiation. A further definition states that particles or deposits are molten, and thus in the liquid state. Fouling is referred to deposits, which are not directly exposed to flame radiation. Deposits in this area are typically caused by solidified particles. Fouling layers are loosely bound or partly sintered, and therefore usually more easy to clean [15]. Fig. 1 shows areas threatened by slagging (filled with gray color) and fouling (no color). In modern tower boiler configurations, this area ends after the first superheater, when radiation of the flame is shaded by earlier tube banks. In the conventional two path boiler design, this area is in the cross-over path between the first and the second duct. The transition between slagging and fouling is smooth and the extent to which a certain fuel leads to slagging or fouling is highly dependent on the form and chemical composition of the inorganic material within the fuel as well as the process conditions inside the boiler. T a g g e d P Fluidized bed combustion systems can be characterized as either bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) or circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion systems. The basic idea is to burn the fuel in a hot bed of small particles, e.g. quartz sand, which are fluidized using combustion air from below. The bed material is typically kept at relatively low temperatures (800À900 °C) in order to reduce pollutant formation, particle agglomeration (e.g. caused by low melting ash particles), ash deposition and corrosion. Furthermore, chemically inert material is used to inhibit reactions between fuel ash and bed materials. An exception are sulfur-rich fuels (e.g. pet-coke), where limestone is added to the bed material, in order to reduce SO 2 emissions. The combustion air is injected using jets from below and depending on gas velocity, particle size and density of the bed material, bed material is entrained in the flow (CFB) or it remains in a bubbling bed (BFB -stationary fluidized bed). CFB systems circulate the bed material and require a separation unit, typically a cyclone. These systems enable a higher energy density and improved heat transfer rates, however design and operation are more complex. Furthermore, bed material such as quartz is known to be erosive, leading to erosion on heat exchanging surfaces and/or to the removal of deposits. Fluidized bed combustion systems are characterized by good mixing characteristics between fuel, combustion air and the bed material and thus a high momentum and heat transfer leading to a uniform temperature distribution. T a g g e d P Fluidized bed systems are typically built in medium size, from 30 to 350 MW el , for troublesome fuel ashes or fuels with a low volatile content and thus low combustibility (e.g. pet-coke or sewage sludge with a high moisture content). Typical fuels are waste wood, petcoke, solid recovered fuels (SRF) in the form of pellets or sewage sludge [27À29]. The fuels' high ash content and low ash melting temperature can be handled through a moderate and uniform temperature enabled by the good mixing behavior inside the bed material. The biggest concerns for operators are bed reactions and agglomeration. Bed agglomeration can lead to a decrease in heat transfer and fluidization. In extreme events it may lead to the total defluidization of the bed, resulting in unscheduled plant shut down [30]. Bed agglomeration is often caused by chemical reactions of inorganic vapors or molten phases of salts and/or silicates. These mechanisms and ash species can lead to coating, adhesion and sintering between sand particles [30,31]. Slagging is rarely reported for FB combustion, due to low temperatures and erosion by bed material, compared to grate firing or PF systems. T a g g e d P Grate combustion is typically used for low-grade fuels with troubling ash behavior. Commonly used fuels are municipal solid wastes (MSW), straw or wood including waste wood, forest residues or demolition wood. The fuel is burned without pretreatment on a moving grate, where combustion air is supplied from beneath. Modern systems use a staged air supply, where the combustion zone on the grate uses low stoichiometries in order to suppress nitric oxides. T a g g e d P A substantial part of the inorganic material is transported out of the systems as solid ash particles and agglomerates via the grate. However, small ash particles and inorganic vapors can be entrained by combustion gases. They are liberated from the grate and transported through the flue gas duct of the boiler. The first duct is typically cladded in order to prevent the boiler wall from deposition of molten ash particles and excessive corrosion. Steam temperatures are often limited to values below 500 °C, due to high chlorine contents in the raw fuel, and, thus, the threat of high temperature chlorine-induced corrosion. Studies on straw grate firing have shown that fly ash is enriched in salt species consisting mainly of K, S and Cl, compared to bottom ash, which is silicate like and rich in K, Ca and Si [32]. This fly ash can lead to severe operational problems such as slagging in the furnace or fouling at lower temperatures further downstream, e.g. on secondary or tertiary superheaters. T a g g e d P When comparing combustion systems, the power plant size, final steam temperature and the net electrical efficiency increase typically in the order: grate firing, FB and PF as illustrated in Fig. 1. The choice of combustion system is mainly depending on the fuel, its availability and inorganic constituents. Fig. 2 shows steam temperatures for different firing systems as a function of thermal input. The steam temperature is directly connected to the plant electrical efficiency. The highest steam temperatures are currently obtained for supercritical coal-fired power plants, where the latest built generation reaches values slightly above 600 °C and 285 bar. In addition, Fig. 2 shows current steam temperatures of biomass-fired combustion systems. It can be seen that medium to large-scale systems with a thermal input of 10À200 MW th have relatively low steam temperatures À up to 540 °C À compared to the latest design values of ultra supercritical coal-fired power stations, which exceed 700 °C at 330 bar. Currently, the highest steam temperatures in biomass combustion are found in a tangentially-fired PF system operated by DONG Energy. In 2000, DONG commissioned unit 2 at Avedore Denmark, a 563 MW el , supercritical coal-fired boiler with 600 °C steam temperature and an electrical efficiency of 46%. The unit was converted to high-quality wood pellets in 2004. The operator had to reduce the steam temperature to 540 °C in order to reduce the risk T a g g e d P of ash deposition and corrosion. In 2006, they introduced coal fly ash injection to avoid the corrosive environment and to increase steam temperatures to 560 °C, which led to an electrical efficiency of 43.8%. The process was successful, however, mechanisms are still not understood. Coal fly ash is assumed to absorb potassium, which otherwise forms corrosive KCl-rich inner deposits on superheater tubes. This conversion shows the main problem of today's power generation from solid biomass: deposition and corrosion caused by inorganic species. Even with high-quality wood pellets, steam temperatures are limited. This is even more troubling when using straw and other chlorine-rich biomasses. They are typically burned in systems with much lower steam temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2. Lower temperatures are mainly caused by the threat of severe ash deposit formation and high-temperature chlorine-induced corrosion [33]. An interesting approach was presented for grate-firing systems in Masnedø and Maribo Sakskøbing, where the superheater design was changed to so-called collecting superheaters. The new design enabled an increase in final steam temperatures from 450 to 540 °C by allowing the collection of ash deposits. Successful tests revealed a protective oxide layer formation as a shield against chlorine-induced corrosion [34]. T a g g e d P Combustion systems also differ in process conditions, such as particle size, flue gas temperatures, or flue gas velocities, as listed beneath Fig. 1. With higher flue gas temperatures, ash particles are softer/contain a higher fraction of melt and thus their tendency to stick upon impaction on a surface increases. A higher flue gas velocity increases the particle kinetic energy, and thus the probability to impact on walls, such as the boiler wall or tubes. A detailed discussion on process conditions will be given in Section 4. Solid fuel combustion in a furnace involves a number of complex steps releasing chemically-bound energy as heat. Typically, there are four steps describing the process of solid fuel combustion [35,36]: (1) drying and release of moisture, (2) devolatilization, i.e. thermal decomposition and release of volatile matter, (3) ignition and combustion of volatile matter, (4) and char combustion. Char combustion is known as the slowest step and the parameter determining the furnace height in PF combustion systems. Char combustion has to be T a g g e d P completed before particles can enter the superheating region. Otherwise, particle temperatures are too high due to the exothermic oxidation and ash is molten, thereby increasing the sticking propensity and the risk of corrosion. During the process of combustion, inorganic constituents transform physically and chemically and form the remaining ash, which is dominated by solid ash particles. However, inorganics can also be found as gaseous species, as liquid droplets or as solids, depending on the fuel and flue gas temperature. The following sections focus on observations made in experiments and their implication for numerical models. They include an overview on fuel inorganics, as well as fundamentals of ashD 1 9 5 X X and deposit formation.T a g g e d P Typical solid fuel combustion systems are illustrated and compared in Fig. 1. They comprise of three main types: grate combustion, fluidized bed (FB) combustion and pulverized fuel (PF) combustion systems. Characteristics of each boiler type are summarized underneath each schematic. The main difference among boiler types are boiler size, fuel quality, fuel processing before combustion, fuel-oxidizer ratio, gas flow conditions as well as temperatures. T a g g e d P Pulverized fuel boilers are the most commonly built systems for power generation from coal. Pulverized fuel, with a typical particle size smaller than 200 mm, is transported with preheated air or recirculated flue gas to the burner and into the furnace. Particles heat up, release combustible gases and react with oxygen, forming flue gas. The flue gas is transported with the remaining ash particles through the combustion chamber. Boiler walls and tubes inside the combustion system act as heat exchanging surfaces, where heat is transferred from the flue gas to the water-steam cycle. PF systems are designed in a way that combustion is completed before the flue gas reaches the first convective heat exchanger in the form of tube banks. This ensures lower temperatures of remaining fly ash particles, compared to burning particles, and thus a reduced threat of molten, sticky ash particles adhering to heat exchanging surfaces. There are studies indicating that char particles burn at temperatures up to 300 K higher than the surrounding flue gas [24]. A critical parameter, when designing the furnace and its height, is the ash softening and ash melting temperature. The furnace exit gas temperature should stay below the ash softening temperature. However, this criterion can also fail. There are studies reporting up to 50% of melt in the ash system at the ash softening temperature [25,26]. In this case, there can be excessive deposit formation, even though the furnace exit gas temperature is below the ash softening temperature. The main difficulty in boiler design is to achieve a high level of burnout, while staying below the ash softening temperature. This is challenging, since nowadays, fuel and load flexibility become more and more important. Within combustion systems, ash deposition is T a g g e d P often defined as either slagging or fouling. Slagging occurs in the furnace area, where heat exchanging surfaces are exposed directly to flame radiation. A further definition states that particles or deposits are molten, and thus in the liquid state. Fouling is referred to deposits, which are not directly exposed to flame radiation. Deposits in this area are typically caused by solidified particles. Fouling layers are loosely bound or partly sintered, and therefore usually more easy to clean [15]. Fig. 1 shows areas threatened by slagging (filled with gray color) and fouling (no color). In modern tower boiler configurations, this area ends after the first superheater, when radiation of the flame is shaded by earlier tube banks. In the conventional two path boiler design, this area is in the cross-over path between the first and the second duct. The transition between slagging and fouling is smooth and the extent to which a certain fuel leads to slagging or fouling is highly dependent on the form and chemical composition of the inorganic material within the fuel as well as the process conditions inside the boiler. T a g g e d P Fluidized bed combustion systems can be characterized as either bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) or circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion systems. The basic idea is to burn the fuel in a hot bed of small particles, e.g. quartz sand, which are fluidized using combustion air from below. The bed material is typically kept at relatively low temperatures (800À900 °C) in order to reduce pollutant formation, particle agglomeration (e.g. caused by low melting ash particles), ash deposition and corrosion. Furthermore, chemically inert material is used to inhibit reactions between fuel ash and bed materials. An exception are sulfur-rich fuels (e.g. pet-coke), where limestone is added to the bed material, in order to reduce SO 2 emissions. The combustion air is injected using jets from below and depending on gas velocity, particle size and density of the bed material, bed material is entrained in the flow (CFB) or it remains in a bubbling bed (BFB -stationary fluidized bed). CFB systems circulate the bed material and require a separation unit, typically a cyclone. These systems enable a higher energy density and improved heat transfer rates, however design and operation are more complex. Furthermore, bed material such as quartz is known to be erosive, leading to erosion on heat exchanging surfaces and/or to the removal of deposits. Fluidized bed combustion systems are characterized by good mixing characteristics between fuel, combustion air and the bed material and thus a high momentum and heat transfer leading to a uniform temperature distribution. T a g g e d P Fluidized bed systems are typically built in medium size, from 30 to 350 MW el , for troublesome fuel ashes or fuels with a low volatile content and thus low combustibility (e.g. pet-coke or sewage sludge with a high moisture content). Typical fuels are waste wood, petcoke, solid recovered fuels (SRF) in the form of pellets or sewage sludge [27À29]. The fuels' high ash content and low ash melting temperature can be handled through a moderate and uniform temperature enabled by the good mixing behavior inside the bed material. The biggest concerns for operators are bed reactions and agglomeration. Bed agglomeration can lead to a decrease in heat transfer and fluidization. In extreme events it may lead to the total defluidization of the bed, resulting in unscheduled plant shut down [30]. Bed agglomeration is often caused by chemical reactions of inorganic vapors or molten phases of salts and/or silicates. These mechanisms and ash species can lead to coating, adhesion and sintering between sand particles [30,31]. Slagging is rarely reported for FB combustion, due to low temperatures and erosion by bed material, compared to grate firing or PF systems.

This ash forming matter varies strongly among different fuel types, and for coal it can range from as low as 2 wt.% in a clean feedstock up to 40 wt.% for low-grade lignite.

        <p>T a g g e d P Fig. 3 shows the most common forms: organically-bound inorganics, included and excluded mineral grains (not illustrated are dissolved salts). Ward [37] describes the first two groups (dissolved salts and organically-bound inorganics) as non-mineral inorganics. The amount of these inorganic constituents strongly depends on the fuel rank. An estimate on the amount of these elements can be found in Fig. 4 based on various literature references. The lowest quantity is typically observed for bituminous coals. Typical elements are alkali metals (Na, K), alkaline earth metals (Ca and Mg), P, S and Cl. High-rank coal inorganics have around 5À10 wt.% of these non-mineral inorganics, low-rank coals such as lignites or brown coals typically 10À40 wt.% of the total amount of inorganics [15,38]. In the case of biomass, this strongly depends on the plant type, where herbaceous biomass such as straw has around 15À58 wt.% (estimated Fig. 4. Expected amount and elements that can be vaporized during solid fuel combustion as a function of fuel type (ranges estimated from various references for coal [15,38,57], woody biomass [43À45,52], and herbaceous biomass (mainly straw) [40À42]).

        <p>T a g g e d P from data of e.g. [40À42]), and wood-based feedstocks range from 12 up to 56 wt.% (estimated from data of e.g. [43À45,52]). An interesting biomass that produces low quantities of inorganic vapors is rice husk. Rice husks are extremely rich in silicon, as shown in Table 1D 2 1 0 X X. Inorganics in rice husks are non-leachable as shown by chemical fractionation studies [53]. Based on these results it is estimated that the amount of vaporizable elements is very low, probably below 5 wt.%. However, it has to be mentioned that the amount is difficult to determine and strongly dependent on the fuel, the temperature during conversion, the heating rate, the residence time at a certain temperature, and the measurement device. These inorganic components (Al, Ca, Cl, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Si, S, Ti and trace elements) can be covalently and ionically bound to the organic matter. The elements are present in ion-exchangeable forms and as salts of carboxylic acids within the organic matter [56]. Dissolved salts in coals can for instance originate from contact with sea water. In addition, plants have soluble salts in their liquid phases [6]. Both groups, dissolved salts and organically-bound elements are known to vaporize T a g g e d P during the combustion, leading to inorganic vapors in the gas phase. These vapors can re-condense to small particles, referred to as aerosols or sub-micron ash particles. A method that might be suitable in order to estimate the amount of vaporizable inorganics is chemical fractionation, often referred to as leaching. During this method, the fuel samples are dissolved in various solvents and the remaining residue and eluate are analyzed [38]. There are several methods and procedures described in literature [61]. Typical solvents are deionized water, ammonium acetate and hydrochloric acid. Elements that are leachable in the first two, are assumed to be vaporizable. Chemical fractionation of coals was for instance done in projects Sodium [54] and Calcium [55] at the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC) in early 1990s; see also Benson and Holm [38]. Chemical fractionation results of commonly used biomass can be found in the work of Zevenhoven et al. [6]. T a g g e d P Discrete inorganic particles are often referred to as mineral matter in the fuel [56]. They are present as mineral grains within the organic matter or separated from it. Most minerals are in crystalline T a g g e d P form, however some can exist as amorphous phases. Both transform during the combustion and the remaining residue is referred to as ash. Strictly, ash is the remaining solid residue after complete conversion [15]. However, literature is not consistent and an incorrect use of the terms ash, inorganic constituents and mineral matter is common. The amount, chemical composition and size distribution of ash is highly-dependent on the fuel and the form of inorganic constituents as well as the combustion system (temperatures, atmospheres) and fuel preparation (e.g. grinding, washing). Laboratory ash has a considerably different temperature-and time-history compared to ash samples collected in power plants. Furthermore, the atmosphere (i.e. oxidizing or reducing) will influence ash characteristics. Unfortunately, there is inaccuracy in the literature, and preparation or sampling techniques are often not stated clearly. Particular care must be taken for obtaining representative samples. This is less important in laboratory-scale, but can be of great importance in a PF boiler, as the amount analyzed is extremely small compared to mass flow rates in a full-scale furnace [15]. Furthermore, information on the feedstock and its origin (e.g. coal mine and storage) is missing in most studies. By knowing the amount of remaining ash, empirical correlations can be used to estimate the mineral matter content in the raw fuel. There are empirical equations in literature, which relate the mass fraction of mineral matter w m to the proximate ash yield w a and the total sulfur content w S,D 2 1 1 X X total , such as the one suggested by Parr [58] given by: w m ¼ 1:08 ¢ w a þ 0:55 ¢ w S;total in wt:%:T a g g e d P from data of e.g. [40À42]), and wood-based feedstocks range from 12 up to 56 wt.% (estimated from data of e.g. [43À45,52]).

Generally speaking, inorganic matter transforms, decomposes and releases gaseous components during conversion. Typical components are H 2 O, CO 2 , Cl 2 , HCl, SO 2 or H 2 S depending on conditions and stoichiometry [59,60]. Therefore, in most correlations, the mineral matter content in the raw fuel is around 10% higher than the final ash content. The sulfur content, w S,D 2 1 2 X X total , contributes to some extent to the ash yield depending on its occurrence. Sulfur can be either present in the form of organic sulfur bound to the coal structure, as sulphides originating from e.g. pyrite, sulphates, e.g. CaSO 4 , or as elemental sulfur [35]. Detailed information and discussion of mineral transformations and decompositions are provided in the following sections. Vassilev and Tasc on [56] come to another order. They argue that coal ash is the inorganic residue resulting from incineration of coal and that it is composed of original and new-formed inorganic phases generated from both inorganic and organic matter [56]. They state that the magnitude should be in the order of ash &gt; inorganic matter &gt; mineral matter; where the mineral matter is a part of the inorganic matter and organically-bound inorganic compounds are not included in the inorganic matter according to their definition [56]. However, lower values of ash than mineral matter are commonly observed when ash is produced at high temperatures and inorganic T a g g e d P constituents volatilize [56] and minerals decompose. Furthermore, it has to be mentioned that measuring the amount of inorganic matter and mineral matter is highly difficult and an accurate and reliable method is currently not available. Different forms of inorganic compounds, various mineral types and the heterogeneity of solid fuels are the main reasons for the inconsistency and confusion in literature. T a g g e d P A compilation of different fuel types and their ash characteristics is presented in Table 2. Six major groups -comprising of bituminous coal, lignite, herbaceous biomass such as straw or grasses, woody biomass, manures and sludges as well as waste-based fuels -are summarized in terms of typical heating value, ash content, ash fusion (fluid) temperature and major ash forming elements. By far the highest ash content is observed for waste-based fuels and manures such as sewage sludge with values up to 50 wt.% on a dry basis (d.b.). There are some reports of lignites with very high ash contents, however typical coals have lower values between 10 and 20 wt. % (d.b.). Bituminous coals are dominated by Si, Al and Fe, which mainly originate from mineral grains composed of aluminosilicates, quartz or pyrite depending on the coal seam. The bulk ash fusion temperatures are fairly high, usually at around 1200 up to 1500 °C. However, there can be single particles with low melting eutectics with considerably lower melting temperatures in particular for iron bearing mineral grains. Lignites can vary widely and are often dominated by Ca, Mg, Fe, S and Si. Frequently found minerals are carbonates, gypsum, quartz and many others. Melting temperatures are typically slightly lower, compared with bituminous coals. Very low melting temperatures down to 950 °C are observed for straw and grasses, mainly due to the high potassium content. Si, Al, K species -found within the plant -can form low melting ash particles. This together with high chlorine contents leave straw to be a troublesome fuel. On the contrary, wood-based fuels are often reported to be less problematic. The have relativity high melting temperatures, mainly due to the abundance of calcium. The majority of ash forming elements is found within the bark -with ash contents of 5-8 wt.% (d.b.). Very difficult and heterogeneous fuels are manures and waste-based fuels, such as MSW or SRF, demolition wood and other residues. Manures are often rich in phosphorus and heavy metals, leading to problems concerning the ash utilization. A further summary of major ash forming species and their quantity within different solid fuels is presented in Table 1. Different groups comprise of bituminous coals, lignites and different biomass including Nordic wood, herbaceous biomass and agricultural residues. Woody biomass is differentiated into bulk wood, bark, twigs, needles and leaves. The table reveals that woody biomass is dominated by Ca and K making up for around 65 mol.%, followed by Mg and S. Twigs, needles and leaves have an increased content of K and P compared with bark and stem wood. Furthermore, it is shown that bark, twigs, shoots, needles and leaves have a strongly increased content of inorganic matter, up to ten times higher, compared with stem wood. The amount of inorganics found in annual biomass is similar to bark in the range of 3À10 wt.% of the fuel. Inorganic species in Table 2 Typical ranges for ash content, ash fusion temperature and major ash forming elements for different fuel types.

        <p>T a g g e d P Fig. 5 shows a back-scattered electron (BSE) microscope image of unprocessed wood (a) and straw (b). In BSE images, the intensity of the signal and thus the intensity of gray in the image is strongly related to the mean atomic number of elements in the sample. Therefore, minerals with high atomic numbers appear brighter, compared to the organic structure or the embedding material with lower atomic numbers. Wood, shown in Fig. 5 In addition, some clay minerals containing Mg and/or Ca were found during the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and SEM/EDX (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analyses. T a g g e d P A very powerful characterization method for inorganic constituents and their variation within one sample is the so-called "computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy" (CCSEM) analysis. This method allows to analyze the raw fuel sample directly without any thermal pretreatment such as ashing in a muffle furnace. The fuel is mount in epoxy, cut and the cross-section is polished. Conventional SEM or CCSEM are often applied for the identification (type, form and size) and quantification of minerals in coals. Fig. 6 shows a BSE microscope image of bituminous coal particles. It can be seen that a substantial fraction of the mineral matter is excluded from the fuel matrix. Additionally, the amount and number of mineral inclusions vary widely among different coal particles. Therefore, scanning electron microscopy is a key method for developing a detailed fuel model for numerical codes. T a g g e d P The CCSEM technique was developed during the late 1970's and early 80's when computer supported electron microscopy became available. The first studies using computer-controlled SEM techniques focused on classifying the mineral size distribution and composition within pulverized coals [67]. Steadman et al. [269] and Zygarlicke et al. [68] were among the first to differentiate between included and excluded minerals. During CCSEM, coal particles are mounted in an embedding material which is polished, carbon coated T a g g e d P and placed in an electron microscope. In order to distinguish between included and excluded minerals, a distinct contrast between the embedding material and coal matrix is needed. Two possible methods can be found in the literature. The best contrast on the BSE pictures is derived using carnauba wax. Another method is to increase the average atomic number by dissolving ten percent iodoform in epoxy resin [69]. This resin is then mixed with coal particles and hardener. Once the sample is polished and carbon-coated, the cross-section can be investigated using SEM. CCSEM can be applied for coal, char and ash particle characterization. Typical results provide information on the mineral composition, its size and type (excluded or included). Eleven elements are detected most commonly including Al, Ca, Cl, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P, Si, S and Ti. The sample is scanned automatically by computer and X-ray detectors are used to quantify elements of individual mineral grains. The composition of a mineral grain is then compared with a database of mineral compositions and subsequently classified. It has to be mentioned that a classification leads to a loss in information. For instance, a mineral grain with a composition close to quartz is classified as pure quartz (SiO 2 ). Typical minerals in the system include quartz, Fig. 6. BSE image of embedded bituminous coal particles and their classification. T a g g e d P kaolinite, pyrite, rutile, montmorillonite, apatite, gypsum, various silicates, and many others [3]. T a g g e d P CCSEM analysis can provide very useful details and insight in the heterogeneity of a solid fuel, as shown in Fig. 7. Monroe [23] detected around 6000 mineral grains for a Kentucky No. 9 coal. It is shown that mineral grain composition varies widely within one fuel sample and therefore, each mineral grain has its own transformation and melting point. Where classic ash oxide analysis yields just one average point, CCSEM illustrates a number of points with varying composition. CCSEM is able to provide information on the variation in chemical composition, form and size of minerals. However, this method has to be applied with care. There are some limitations and disadvantages when using CCSEM techniques. Ignoring these limitations can lead to different results and wrong conclusions. For instance, particles in the sub-micrometer range cannot be detected without using very high magnifications, which is impracticable. A sufficiently high number of particles have to be analyzed in order to obtain statistically meaningful and quantitative results. Typical results are in the range of 2000-4000 particles. This is of special interest when a broad particle size distribution (PSD) has to be characterized. Furthermore, using different magnifications can lead to different results and more importantly, Sarofim and Helble [70] discuss that particle sizes in a cross-section are artificially shifted towards smaller diameters (due to the effect that the probability to intersect a sphere at its pole is low). Another problem is associated with the electron beam size. The size of the beam restricts the lower limit of mineral inclusions to about 1 mm, depending on the magnification. Often, small clusters of two or more different mineral grains close to each other and with different chemistry cannot be distinguished, and results show a misleading composition. Furthermore, they are classified as one instead of multiple grains. The penetration depth of the beam is also a parameter affecting the lower detection limit. Furthermore, atomically-dispersed elements, i.e. organicallybound inorganics, cannot be identified or quantified.T a g g e d P Fig. 5 shows a back-scattered electron (BSE) microscope image of unprocessed wood (a) and straw (b).

        <p>T a g g e d P Although information on mineral-mineral (two different mineral grains in a cluster close to each other) or mineral-maceral association can be determined, commercially available CCSEM analyses do not provide such data. It is often difficult to differentiate between coal particles and resin; hence an automatic procedure is not applicable. There are only a few studies on the mineral-organic association using CCSEM [72À75]. An interesting approach is the QEMSCAN system, developed at CSIRO [76,77]. QEMSCAN describes a method that directly enables the measurement of mineral matter -organic matter association on a particle-by-particle basis. The difference compared to CCSEM analysis is that coal particles are included in the analysis and the whole cross-section is analyzed pixel by pixel. Mounting medium and coal particles are distinguished by the brightness of the BSE picture, and the X-ray spectrum. Around 4 000 particles are required for statistically significant results [78]. Studies on the distribution of inorganic constituents in solid fuels are rare in literature. Typically, CCSEM analyses are carried out providing information on the amount and type of included and excluded mineral grains. However, CCSEM analyses are not covering organically-bound inorganics and do not give information on the association of the coal matrix with mineral grains. A study of Liu et al. [78] uses the QEMSCAN technique to determine the mineral-maceral association for 14 different Australian coals. The most abundant particle type found by Liu et al. [78] were particles without mineral grains. Only, about 10% of the particles' cross-sections contained mineral inclusions. They defined three particle classes, based on these findings. Class 1: coal particles with 95% or more area covered with organic substance, class 2: particles with included minerals containing 40À90% organic substance, and class 3: excluded mineral grains, containing less than 40% organic substance. According to this classification, the majority of the studied coal samples had an included mineral matter content in the area of 50À80%. There was just one sample with more excluded than included minerals [78]. In a later study, investigated the mineral- T a g g e d P mineral association of excluded mineral grains. They studied three different coals and the corresponding ashes after combustion in a drop-tube furnace at 1400 °C, and came to the conclusion that illite, ankerite and siderite change their shape to spherical particles, while quartz, kaolinite and calcite do not show significant changes. They found mineral associations of quartz and kaolinite in excluded mineral grains, whereas combined particles of carbonates with silicates were rare [79]. T a g g e d P Mineral matter is often reported to be enriched in smaller particle sizes. This trend has been observed in several studies [12,80À84] and can be explained by the fuel grinding process. Unsworth et al. [82] state that particles with high mineral matter content and thus high particle densities tend to be ground to a finer size and may liberate mineral grains. This is based on the effect of a classifier mill, which recycles heavier particles. Only if the particle inertia is low enough, the gas flow can entrain the particle. In particular higherrank coals tend to demonstrate this behavior [15]. T a g g e d P Data on the number of mineral grains per particle and their distribution among coal particle sizes are rare. Barta et al [72,86] developed the so-called "urn" model using CCSEM data. They used a Poisson law in order to distribute mineral grains among individual coal particles. SEM investigations of a size-graded Texas lignite (63À75 mm) revealed a mean value of 15 mineral inclusions per coal particle. Particles were embedded in epoxy resin, cut and polished for measurements using a back-scattered electron detector. An inverse Abelian transformation is applied, in order to obtain volume-based size distributions. The Poisson distribution law is used to describe the number of mineral inclusions per coal particle. For n mineral inclusions in m coal particles the probability P j of finding j mineral particles in a coal particle is calculated by the following equation [72]:T a g g e d P Although information on mineral-mineral (two different mineral grains in a cluster close to each other) or mineral-maceral association can be determined, commercially available CCSEM analyses do not provide such data.

Experimental work on the number of mineral inclusions per coal particle is rarely found in literature. A similar approach was followed by Monroe [23], who used SEM to measure the mineral size of Kentucky #9 coal, with a varying degree of cleaning. Monroe used a Monte Carlo method to distribute mineral matter among individual coal particles. Although there are some studies evaluating mineral size and distribution, general rules are not identified, and each fuel needs to be investigated separately. This is of particular concern for biomass with low mineral matter content. Often, power plant operators use more simplified and cheaper methods in order to determine the slagging and fouling potential of fuels. One of the first tests for new purchased fuels is the popular ash fusion test. T a g g e d P This laboratory test is applied to study the ash melting behavior under controlled conditions. Ash samples, typically produced in a muffle furnace, are pressed to a specimen, heated up under a controlled atmosphere and observed with an optical system. The silhouette recorded from the sample is judged to identify critical temperatures. There are several standards available in literature for ash sample preparation and ash fusion tests. According to Couch [15], the available standards differ quite significantly in terms of T a g g e d P specimen preparation and characteristic temperatures. Specimen and silhouettes of characteristic temperatures are illustrated for the American standard in Fig. 8. These characteristic temperatures are referred to, as initial deformation temperature (IDT), softening (ST), hemispherical (HT) and fluid temperature (FT), respectively. Ash fusion temperatures are often used by boiler designers for selecting the maximum furnace exit temperature and for the estimation of slagging propensities using indices and the bulk ash chemistry. The ash fusion test for biomass uses different characteristic temperatures. Ash samples derived from biomass show a shrinking specimen and therefore the IDT is replaced by the so-called shrinkage starting temperature (SST). The second characteristic temperature is called deformation temperature (DT), whereas the rest is identical. Generally speaking, the applicability of the ash fusion test is questionable. Couch [15] states that laboratory ash is considerably different due to the slow formation process compared to conditions in a boiler. Laboratory ash absorbs SO 3 from sulphates and oxygen from ferric oxides which does not occur in a boiler. Furthermore, heterogeneity strongly influences ash melting temperatures. For example, quartz grains distributed within the specimen lead to a strong compound structure and ash fusion temperatures are often quite high, even though most of the other ash particles are already molten. Van Dyk et al. [88] reported that low viscosity ashes can have a high molten fraction without changing the geometry of the specimen. Another important parameter is the atmosphere under which the test is carried out. The atmosphere can be selected either as oxidizing or reducing. It is reported in literature that reducing conditions lead to lower ash fusion temperatures, typically around 50 K. A dominant role exhibit iron minerals and their transformation under reducing conditions [15]. Bryers [89] correlates the ash softening temperature under reducing conditions for eight eastern US coals to the sum of basic compounds in the ash. A parabolic curve can be found with the minimum temperature at approximately 50 wt.% of basic compounds. Therefore, the amount of basic compounds in the fuel can help to estimate the threat of slagging and fouling. However, detailed information on individual particles, which might melt at much lower temperatures (50À250 K), can only be obtained by SEM methods. Furthermore, detailed predictions on ash formation, in terms of ash particle size distribution and chemistry, can only be conducted if SEM data is available.where r c and r m are the density of the coal substance and of the mineral inclusion, M 3,D 2 1 5 X X m is the third moment of the mineral size distribution, and w m is the mass fraction of the mineral inclusion.

These characteristic temperatures are referred to, as initial deformation temperature (IDT), softening (ST), hemispherical (HT) and fluid temperature (FT), respectively. Ash fusion temperatures are often used by boiler designers for selecting the maximum furnace exit temperature and for the estimation of slagging propensities using indices and the bulk ash chemistry. The ash fusion test for biomass uses different characteristic temperatures. Ash samples derived from biomass show a shrinking specimen and therefore the IDT is replaced by the so-called shrinkage starting temperature (SST). The second characteristic temperature is called deformation temperature (DT), whereas the rest is identical. Generally speaking, the applicability of the ash fusion test is questionable. Couch [15] states that laboratory ash is considerably different due to the slow formation process compared to conditions in a boiler. Laboratory ash absorbs SO 3 from sulphates and oxygen from ferric oxides which does not occur in a boiler. Furthermore, heterogeneity strongly influences ash melting temperatures. For example, quartz grains distributed within the specimen lead to a strong compound structure and ash fusion temperatures are often quite high, even though most of the other ash particles are already molten. Van Dyk et al. [88] reported that low viscosity ashes can have a high molten fraction without changing the geometry of the specimen. Another important parameter is the atmosphere under which the test is carried out. The atmosphere can be selected either as oxidizing or reducing. It is reported in literature that reducing conditions lead to lower ash fusion temperatures, typically around 50 K. A dominant role exhibit iron minerals and their transformation under reducing conditions [15]. Bryers [89] correlates the ash softening temperature under reducing conditions for eight eastern US coals to the sum of basic compounds in the ash. A parabolic curve can be found with the minimum temperature at approximately 50 wt.% of basic compounds. Therefore, the amount of basic compounds in the fuel can help to estimate the threat of slagging and fouling. However, detailed information on individual particles, which might melt at much lower temperatures (50À250 K), can only be obtained by SEM methods. Furthermore, detailed predictions on ash formation, in terms of ash particle size distribution and chemistry, can only be conducted if SEM data is available.</p>

It occurs along with devolatilization, char conversion and subsequent flue gas cooling. Depending on the fuel, a considerable amount of inorganic constituents may vaporize. Mainly, organically-associated inorganic compounds are released as inorganic vapors, during devolatilization and char conversion. These inorganic vapors are illustrated by open arrows, whereas solid particles are shown with filled arrows, in Fig. 9. Remaining inorganic constituents, mainly mineral matter, decompose, transform to ash, melt and coalesce (fuse together) depending on the mineral type and temperatures. The behavior of included minerals is complex. Most ash particles have a sufficiently high surface tension to form liquid droplets and thus, do no wet the char particle surface [57]. Included mineral grains are often reported to coalesce during char conversion. During coalescence, mineral inclusions come into contact with each other and fuse to one remaining ash particle. Coalescence of mineral inclusions has been investigated by several authors. Sarofim and Helble [70] suggest the full coalescence model as a good starting point for estimating the T a g g e d P ash particle size distribution. In this model, every coal particle yields exactly one ash particle. The full coalescence model yields the largest possible particle size distribution (assuming no particle-particle collisions in the bulk flow).

Sarofim and Helbe [70] refer to a publication of Wall et al. [71], noting that Eq. ( 4) is less accurate for coals with high shares of included mineral matter content (e.g. w a &gt; 20 wt.%). For such coals, the volume occupied by the ash has to be considered. Wilemski and Srinivasachar [104] successfully used a Monte Carlo method for the mineral distribution in combination with the full coalescence model for the prediction of ash size distribution. However, the same model failed for a highly cleaned coal, which showed excessive fragmentation behavior. Barta et al. [86] developed the random coalescence model in combination with a char combustion model, providing limits for the coalescence of mineral inclusion. The model is based on input from CCSEM analyses. This model uses a simple char burnout formulation with two subsequent steps. In the beginning, char conversion is assumed to occur in the diffusion-limited regime with a shrinking particle diameter. Mineral inclusions are released step by step and assumed to adhere to the surface as molten particles. If ash particles get in contact due to a shrinking char structure, they start to coalesce. In the next step, the combustion is assumed to be in the kinetically-limited regime. Particles now burn from the inside and the diameter is unchanged. By this approach, coalescence is interrupted, and char particles break up once they reach a critical porosity. A further development was presented by Yan et al. [9] for highrank coals using CCSEM data. Included and excluded minerals were treated differently. Included minerals were distributed randomly among coal particles using Poisson distribution. The authors found that small particles do not fuse together. Best agreement is reported when using a partial coalescence model as shown in Fig. 10. An interesting ash formation model for CFD codes is presented in a T a g g e d P study of Zhou et al. [454]. The model accounts for ash layer collapse during char burnout and assumes coalescence. Such a model should be extended for char fragmentation and should be validated with measurements. In this case char fragmentation becomes important. Char fragmentation was first mentioned 80 years ago by Davis and Hottel [107] and is often given as an explanation for differences in predictions and observations of particle size distributions or fly ash formation. Fragmentation can occur during devolatilization, during char combustion, or for excluded mineral grains, in particular minerals, which undergo thermal decomposition. The majority of literature references reporting fragmentation observed char fragmentation. It is reported for different fuel ranks, however, mostly for swelling coals. Char fragmentation influences ash formation, as shown in Figs. 11 and12, and therefore also the remaining particle size distribution as well as char conversion rates. The onset and extent of char fragmentation can be predicted using percolation models [109,116,477,478]. When the particle reaches a critical porosity, typically around 0.8, but values scatter in-between 0.2 up to 0.96 [113,125], it is assumed to fragment, where the number of fragments is dependent on the particle size, char structure and many other parameters [96]. Furthermore, the initial char structure is known to affect the ash formation. Wilemski and Srinivasachar proposed a fragmentation model for cenospherical particles, where particles break up into a certain number of fragments as shown by Fig. 11. Mineral grains in these fragments fuse together and form the T a g g e d P remaining ash. A similar model considering different char particle shapes was presented by . Fig. 12 shows the ash formation mechanism postulated for different char types and included minerals. Typically, three different char types are reported in literature [163,164]: type I chars are spherical to subspherical particles with thin walls ( &lt; 5 mm) and high porosity values, so-called cenospheres. Type II particles show a sub-spherical shape with medium porosity, almost no swelling and variable wall thicknesses. And type III chars, which are relatively dense, have an angular shape and a swelling coefficient smaller than unity. Wu et al. [105] used a size-graded and density-fractionated Australian bituminous coal and studied their conversion in a drop-tube furnace at 1300 °C, atmospheric pressure and air. The coal sample was in a narrow size range of 63À90 mm and excluded minerals were removed by sink/float separation with an upper specific gravity of 2.0 g/cm 3 [105]. Combustion took place in the diffusion-limited regime. Depending on the char type, a different degree of coalescence is assumed. Char type III forms one remaining ash particle, whereas for char type I every mineral inclusion forms an individual ash particle. Thus, information on char structure is necessary according to the authors. They further argued that different char types have different observed reactivities. Char type I is assumed to fragment and burn four times faster than the dense and less porous char type III. This might also be due to different specific surface areas of varying char types. Char fragmentation of type I seems to determine ash formation during early stages of combustion, while the formation of coarse fly ash particles occurs by coalescence of included mineral matter during late stages of combustion [105]. Syred et al. [121] give an overview on mechanisms leading to particle fragmentation. Reasons can be: T a g g e d P Fragmentation is often divided into primary and secondary fragmentation. Primary fragmentation refers to fragmentation induced by mechanical stresses (thermal or pressure), mostly during devolatilization, whereas secondary fragmentation is related to char conversion induced by coalescence of large pores at late stages of burnout (percolation) [112]. Experiments on fragmentation cover a broad range of fuels and carbons with different process parameters such as temperature, oxygen partial pressure and particle size. Table 3 summarizes experimental investigations on fragmentation, listing the fuel, particle size and the observed mechanism of fragmentation. Evaluation of this data indicates the predominant role of a percolative nature of char fragmentation. T a g g e d P Char fragmentation during coal combustion strongly depends on the particle size. Large particles are often reported to fragment due to thermal stresses as shown in Table 3 and the work Senneca et al. [114,133] or Dacombe et al. [112,128]. Small particles, typical for PF combustion, on the other hand fragment due to percolative mechanisms. The oxidation proceeds and erodes organic substance by releasing ash particles sitting on the char surface. A similar mechanism is expected to occur for biomass char. However, experimental data on biomass fragmentation is rare and only recently studies appeared. Fig. 13 shows spruce wood particles after pyrolysis. Cotton-like agglomerations of small ash particles and Ca-rich crystals are sitting on the char surface. It is assumed that these particles are liberated during burnout. However, direct experimental evidence is missing. Most of the studies on biomass presented in Table 3 were under fluidized bed combustion conditions with relatively large wood pellets or wood chips. In these cases, interaction between bed material and fuel particles occurs. The majority of these studies reported primary fragmentation during devolatilization together T a g g e d P with attrition of ash particles from surfaces, probably caused by interactions between bed material and fuel. Percolative fragmentation during char conversion is also reported for biomass [120,125], probably due to the fact that biomass chars have higher porosity values compared with coal [119]. T a g g e d P Fragmentation and its extent is difficult to determine in experiments, in particular for small particle sizes. Thermal stresses during heating or the oxidation of thin particle structures will lead to fragmentation. One can imagine that particle sampling and collision with tubes and boiler walls might also lead to fragmentation events, which is not discussed in literature. There are many uncertainties and sources of errors leading to a highly discussed field of research.

        <p>Theoretical considerations including rotational and surface tension forces showed that this effect is of minor importance for small, molten mineral grains sitting on the char surface. Nevertheless shedding might be a source of small particles in large-scale boilers with highly turbulent flow fields, when mineral grains are not properly attached to the char surface; e.g. if they are solidified. This effect should be studied in large-scale test rigs with considerably higher gas velocities (3À15 m/s compared to 0.2À2 m/s in lab-scale test rigs). Often it is difficult to differentiate between shedding and fragmentation due to the erosion of organic substance, called percolative fragmentation [168,169]. T a g g e d P The behavior of excluded mineralsD 2 2 3 X X depends on the mineral type. Quartz can be transported through the combustion system without any changes and maintain its sharp, angular structure [57]. Other excluded minerals such as clays can fragment during dehydration, melt and form cenospheres or plerospheres, i.e. cenospheres filled with small particles. The same can occur for carbonates. Pyrite is reported to fragment more easily due to its framboidal structure T a g g e d P [57]. Both, coalescence and fragmentation have a significant effect on the ash size distribution. The remaining ash particles formed by coalescence and/or fragmentation are referred to as fly ash or coarse fly ash and are in the range of 1À50 mm for conventional PF combustion systems. During ash formation, particles are transported through the boiler with decreasing gas temperatures. Due to this temperature decrease, inorganic vapors start to condense. The condensation can be divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous condensation. The type of condensation is dependent on the supersaturation ratio S i of the condensing species i. The supersaturation is calculated by the ratio of the partial pressure of species i, p i , and its saturation pressure p sat,D 2 2 5 X X i at a certain location and temperature (S i ¼ p i =p sat;i -see Section 2.5.3). Homogeneous condensation and the nucleation of sub-micron particles takes place at supersaturation ratios of approximately S i &gt; 5 (numbers in literature range from 1 to 10 [170À174]), whereas heterogeneous condensation is possible at values above unity. Heterogeneous condensation can occur on other particles (char or ash) or on heat exchanging surfaces. This layer can be liquid and sticky or porous depending on the temperature. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous condensation lead to the formation of sub-micron particles, and sub-micron modes depending on where nucleation of vaporized metals occurs. At high concentrations of these fine particulates, coagulation effects due to particle-particle Fig. 14. Shedding of ash particles from char particle surface due to shear forces. Fig. 13.

T a g g e d P interactions can become important leading to agglomeration. This is of great importance for biomass combustion with high shares of inorganic vapors; see the work of Friedlander [171], J€ oller [176], Brunner [101] or Balan [175]. For a detailed experimental and theoretical investigation of fine particulate matter formation during pulverized coal combustion, it is also referred to the work of Wieland [174]. Typical ash particle size distributions for a high-volatile bituminous coal, El-Cerrej on, and barley straw are presented in Fig. 15. The volume distribution is illustrated as a function of particle diameter. The volume distribution equals the mass distribution, if every particle has the same density. However, the heterogeneity in fly ash samples has been observed in various studies, implying that volume and mass distribution are not identical. Thus, the measurement of a mass distribution requires the identification of individual particle chemistry and size, and is therefore highly complex. Alternatively, sieve analysis can be used for the coarse fly ash PSD. However, as shown by Beckmann et al. [397], results can be misleading when compared with other methods such as CCSEM or laser diffraction. Furthermore, sieve analysis is difficult to apply for fly ashes with small particle size, e.g. obtained in PF systems. Both ash samples shown in Fig. 15 are derived from pulverized fuel combustion tests in an entrained flow reactor (for details see the work of Balan [175]). The ash particle size distribution shows two significant modes (local maxima). The first mode is in the area of 0.1 &lt; d p &lt; 1 mm; the socalled sub-micron ash. The second and dominant mode is typically found around 20 mm. The ash sample of straw was collected using an electrostatic low pressure impactor (ELPI) for particles smaller than 10 mm, and a cyclone for larger particles [175]. The coal ash sample was extracted with the cyclone only. Both cyclone ashes and their size distributions were determined using the laser diffraction method. Wieland [174] used the same coal and showed that the amount of sub-micron ash is below 15 wt.% compared to coarse fly ash. As expected, the straw ash has a considerably higher volume fraction in the first mode compared to the coal ash sample. This is mainly due to the high amount of vaporizable species, e.g. organically-associated cations in the straw, in particular potassium. However, uncertainties due to the sampling of the coal ash particles are present and may lead to an increase of the first mode. Sarofim and Helble [70] mention an additional smaller first mode in the range of 0.02 &lt; d p 0.1 mm, which is barely observed in Fig. 15. According to their investigation, this very small, first peak is due to condensation effects. However, they do not have an explanation for the T a g g e d P second mode in the range of 0.1À1 mm. This mode might be caused by percolative fragmentation of ash particles from the burning char particle. Another interesting aspect is the plateau at large particle sizes above 100mm, which might be due to unburnt carbon. It seems that char conversion has a strong impact on fly ash formation and only a combined approach including the distribution of mineral matter in coal and a detailed char conversion model is able to predict the remaining ash particles and their properties. However, detailed information on the fuel and char structure are required for this approach. Furthermore, many studies found indications of char fragmentation for coal [94,95,108,110,112À114,117,168] and biomass [119,120,122À124].Theoretical considerations including rotational and surface tension forces showed that this effect is of minor importance for small, molten mineral grains sitting on the char surface. Nevertheless shedding might be a source of small particles in large-scale boilers with highly turbulent flow fields, when mineral grains are not properly attached to the char surface; e.g. if they are solidified. This effect should be studied in large-scale test rigs with considerably higher gas velocities (3À15 m/s compared to 0.2À2 m/s in lab-scale test rigs). Often it is difficult to differentiate between shedding and fragmentation due to the erosion of organic substance, called percolative fragmentation [168,169]. T a g g e d P The behavior of excluded mineralsD 2 2 3 X X depends on the mineral type. Quartz can be transported through the combustion system without any changes and maintain its sharp, angular structure [57]. Other excluded minerals such as clays can fragment during dehydration, melt and form cenospheres or plerospheres, i.e. cenospheres filled with small particles. The same can occur for carbonates. Pyrite is reported to fragment more easily due to its framboidal structure T a g g e d P [57]. Both, coalescence and fragmentation have a significant effect on the ash size distribution. The remaining ash particles formed by coalescence and/or fragmentation are referred to as fly ash or coarse fly ash and are in the range of 1À50 mm for conventional PF combustion systems. During ash formation, particles are transported through the boiler with decreasing gas temperatures. Due to this temperature decrease, inorganic vapors start to condense. The condensation can be divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous condensation. The type of condensation is dependent on the supersaturation ratio S i of the condensing species i. The supersaturation is calculated by the ratio of the partial pressure of species i, p i , and its saturation pressure p sat,D 2 2 5 X X i at a certain location and temperature (S i ¼ p i =p sat;i -see Section 2.5.3). Homogeneous condensation and the nucleation of sub-micron particles takes place at supersaturation ratios of approximately S i &gt; 5 (numbers in literature range from 1 to 10 [170À174]), whereas heterogeneous condensation is possible at values above unity. Heterogeneous condensation can occur on other particles (char or ash) or on heat exchanging surfaces. This layer can be liquid and sticky or porous depending on the temperature. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous condensation lead to the formation of sub-micron particles, and sub-micron modes depending on where nucleation of vaporized metals occurs. At high concentrations of these fine particulates, coagulation effects due to particle-particle Fig. 14. Shedding of ash particles from char particle surface due to shear forces. Fig. 13. Biomass char with ash particles sitting on its surface: (a) and (b) show spruce char particles produced at 700°C with cotton-like particlesD 4 X X on its surface (area 4: 51% Ca, 11% K, 11% Mg, 8% P and 5% Mn; area 7: 47% Ca, 15% K, 12% Mg, 8% P and 5% Mn; values in mol-% and O,C-free). T a g g e d P interactions can become important leading to agglomeration. This is of great importance for biomass combustion with high shares of inorganic vapors; see the work of Friedlander [171], J€ oller [176], Brunner [101] or Balan [175]. For a detailed experimental and theoretical investigation of fine particulate matter formation during pulverized coal combustion, it is also referred to the work of Wieland [174]. Typical ash particle size distributions for a high-volatile bituminous coal, El-Cerrej on, and barley straw are presented in Fig. 15. The volume distribution is illustrated as a function of particle diameter. The volume distribution equals the mass distribution, if every particle has the same density. However, the heterogeneity in fly ash samples has been observed in various studies, implying that volume and mass distribution are not identical. Thus, the measurement of a mass distribution requires the identification of individual particle chemistry and size, and is therefore highly complex. Alternatively, sieve analysis can be used for the coarse fly ash PSD. However, as shown by Beckmann et al. [397], results can be misleading when compared with other methods such as CCSEM or laser diffraction. Furthermore, sieve analysis is difficult to apply for fly ashes with small particle size, e.g. obtained in PF systems. Both ash samples shown in Fig. 15 are derived from pulverized fuel combustion tests in an entrained flow reactor (for details see the work of Balan [175]). The ash particle size distribution shows two significant modes (local maxima). The first mode is in the area of 0.1 &lt; d p &lt; 1 mm; the socalled sub-micron ash. The second and dominant mode is typically found around 20 mm. The ash sample of straw was collected using an electrostatic low pressure impactor (ELPI) for particles smaller than 10 mm, and a cyclone for larger particles [175]. The coal ash sample was extracted with the cyclone only. Both cyclone ashes and their size distributions were determined using the laser diffraction method. Wieland [174] used the same coal and showed that the amount of sub-micron ash is below 15 wt.% compared to coarse fly ash. As expected, the straw ash has a considerably higher volume fraction in the first mode compared to the coal ash sample. This is mainly due to the high amount of vaporizable species, e.g. organically-associated cations in the straw, in particular potassium. However, uncertainties due to the sampling of the coal ash particles are present and may lead to an increase of the first mode. Sarofim and Helble [70] mention an additional smaller first mode in the range of 0.02 &lt; d p 0.1 mm, which is barely observed in Fig. 15.

It seems that char conversion has a strong impact on fly ash formation and only a combined approach including the distribution of mineral matter in coal and a detailed char conversion model is able to predict the remaining ash particles and their properties. However, detailed information on the fuel and char structure are required for this approach. Furthermore, many studies found indications of char fragmentation for coal [94,95,108,110,112À114,117,168] and biomass [119,120,122À124].</p>
        <p>T a g g e d P 2.3.2. Chemical transformations of inorganic constituents T a g g e d P Inorganic constituents in coal not only undergo physical changes, such as melting, fusion or fragmentation, but also chemical transformation and decomposition. During heat up, part of the inorganic constituents and mineral matter is released as a gaseous species. The mass loss from mineral matter is due to the release of water from clay minerals, carbon dioxide from carbonates, and sulfur from pyrite [57]. This, and the release of organically-bound inorganics are challenges in predicting the ash composition. Gas release is usually included in the proximate analysis leading to erroneous results, especially for coals with a high ash content [57]. Not only the temperature treatment influences the decomposition and chemical transformation. Gas atmosphere and its composition can have a strong impact, in particular reducing environments. These reducing zones lead to a changed chemical transformation of some minerals. Crucial parameters are the availability of oxygen and the particle temperature. Reducing zones are also found inside burning char particles. Within regime II or III there is a depletion of oxygen and thus reducing environments. Fig. 16 shows the transformations of the main minerals found in coals, as a function of temperature. Depending on the mineral type, a very different behavior can be observed. Clay minerals, e.g. kaolinite or illite, are often dominating in the mineral systems. The transformation of kaolinite is well understood. Kaolinite loses water at around 425À525 °C, forming metakaolinite, which then changes to mullite and amorphous quartz, at around 900 °C [15]. The typical melting point of this amorphous phase is around 1700 °C [178]. Illite is a mineral containing most of the iron, magnesium, potassium and/or T a g g e d P sodium of all clays [15]. It is often present in large quantities and with associations to other minerals, such as pyrite [178]. It also starts to decompose at around 400 °C, forming an amorphous aluminosilicate. The melting point strongly depends on the composition. Typical values are around 1400 °C, however, the melting point can be as low as 980 °C for certain eutectics in the K 2 O -Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system [16,179]. Included illite is often reported to coalesce and form low-temperature melts. Excluded illite does not show fragmentation or swelling behavior. Quartz has a very high melting point and is often reported to be inert. Quartz can be liberated during milling and be present as an excluded particle. It can be embedded in clay minerals or exist as a pure mineral [178]. Excluded quartz particles do not melt at temperatures below 1600 °C leading to sharp, erosive ash particles. Quartz is reported to start to volatilize at temperatures around 1650 °C, or above. The behavior of pyrite is rather difficult. Iron is often reported to be a key element in deposit formation [15] and many research has focused on its transformation [8,180,181]. Pure pyrite (Fe 2 S) starts to decompose around 300 °C, releasing sulfur and forming pyrrhotite (Fe 1Àx S), which subsequently oxidizes in the presence of oxygen, to form hematite or magnetite. Hematite and magnetite are again high melting minerals. There are two mechanisms reported in literature, one involving the thermal decomposition and subsequent oxidation, and, the second being a direct oxidation. Both are known to be slow and therefore, kinetic investigations were carried out [182]. Couch [15] mentions a low melting point for partially transformed pyrite. Similar behavior was observed in reducing conditions, where eutectics with melting points around 1220 °C, are reported [8]. Excluded pyrite was studied in a drop tube furnace by Yan et al. [183] observing fragmentation, where each pyrite grain (50 mm) yielded around four child particles. The authors successfully used the Poisson law, similar to Eq. ( 2), in order to predict fragmentation behavior not only for pyrite, but also for calcite. Included pyrite can form eutectics with even lower melting temperatures in the presence of aluminosilicates. McLennan and others [8] report iron bearing glass melts at temperatures as low as 1080 °C. Ten Brink et al. [181] T a g g e d P studied pyrite transformation in a real 2.5 MW th flame. They observed a decomposition to molten FeS, which then oxidized to solid iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 ). The kinetics of the decomposition were estimated to proceed as fast as devolatilization, and the subsequent oxidation as fast as char conversion [181]. Carbonates are known to decompose, and release carbon dioxide. Calcite (CaCO 3 ) for instance starts to loose CO 2 at around 800 °C. Other carbonates such as siderite (FeCO 3 ) or dolomite (MgCO 3 CaCO 3 ), start at roughly 500 °C and 750 °C, respectively [15,16]. Sulfates, for example gypsum, decompose earlier, and form stable anhydrite by the release of water. T a g g e d P Chemical transformations and their complexity are discussed in various references [16,82,178,184]. Process conditions, such as temperature and oxygen content, can change the path of chemical transformations, and lead to a variety of possible routes. Details of the chemistry and mineral decomposition are poorly understood, in particular for particles containing a mixture of mineral inclusions. When considering the melting temperatures shown in Fig. 16, most values are above typical temperatures in combustion systems. However, ash deposition occurs already at much lower values, which is probably due to interactions of mineral inclusions. Associated minerals are referred to as combinations of different mineral types in one particle. These associated minerals and their compounds behave differently, leading to eutectics and lowered melting points. In addition, minerals are often contaminated with other elements. Therefore, modeling the fate of pure minerals is not able to capture real processes. An overview of mineral transformations can be found, for instance, in the work of Unsworth and others [82], Bryers [16],Bo zic[ 184] or Magda [178]. The bar chart illustrated in Fig. 17, gives the mineral composition of the Upper Freeport bituminous coal, before and after combustion [57]. It shows the transformation of major minerals, in particular the oxidation of pyrite to iron oxide, the formation of glass phases and of amorphous silicates. Benson et al. [57] discusses the vast variation of fly ash particles in size and chemical composition. They further claim the dominance of amorphous phases consisting mainly of silicate glass, summing up to 90 or more T a g g e d P wt.%; where glass is defined as an inorganic product of fusion without crystallizing upon cooling from a melt [57]. Physical properties of ash particles, and their role during ash deposition, are discussed in the following sections. T a g g e d P Studies dealing with chemical transformation of inorganics from biomass are scarce. Arvelakis et al. [136,137] studied the effect of leeching on ash behavior of straw and olive residue, as well as, conducted simultaneous thermal analysis on high-alkali biomass ash. Observed reactions and transformation included the release of CO 2 from CaCO 3 , evaporation of KCl and reactions of K 2 CO 3 with SiO 2 . Bostr€ om et al. [11] investigated minerals from woody biomass ashes using XRD analysis. The authors identified empirical biomass ash transformation phenomena in order to predict ash chemistry and underlined the complexity due to a high number of species. In the field of biomass ash formation, much attention was paid to inorganic vaporization and re-condensation, however, studies dealing with mineral inclusions and coarse fly ash formation are rare.T a g g e d P 2.3.2.

        <p>T a g g e d P 2.3.3. Flame-generated aerosols T a g g e d P Aerosols generated during solid fuel combustion and their characteristics received much attention during the 70's and 80's in the case of coal, and during the late 90's in the case of biomass, when the number of units firing lower-grade fuels, such as straw or waste-T a g g e d P wood, increased. Aerosols can be distinguished into organic and inorganic particles. Organic particles such as soot, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons etc., can be caused by incomplete combustion, typically for small-scale biomass boilers. Inorganic aerosols originate from inorganic vapors and their condensation. A typical number and mass distribution for wood combustion in a stove can be seen in Fig. 18(a) and (b), respectively. Different operation conditions show that aerosol concentration can be affected by process conditions such as temperatures, oxygen concentration and distribution. However, for large units such as PF boilers the variation and potential is considerably smaller. Carroll et al. [47] showed for small-scale applications that air staging can reduce particulate matter (PM 1 ) emissions by 16 up to 26% in the case of wood combustion. A much higher potential was reported when co-firing peat with straw [46]. Up to 70% of aerosols were reduced caused by reactions of gaseous alkali vapors with aluminosilicates found in peat -see also Section 2.5.4. Damle et al. [139] collected data on aerosols formed during coal combustion. Fig. 19 compares measured particle concentrations within coal-fired boilers. The first mode typically occurs around d p ¼ 100 nm with particle concentrations in the range of 10 6 À10 8 per cm 3 . It is difficult to compare different studies, since aerosol measurement devices differ, devices are highly complex, and locations inside a boiler, boiler type as well as process conditions highly affect results. Nevertheless, a qualitative estimate on typical particle sizes and their distribution can be drawn from such a comparison. Fig. 20 shows a similar collection of data on the particle number distribution in biomass fired systems. Particle numbers are slightly higher compared with coal measurements and shifted towards larger particle sizes with modes around d p ¼ 100À300 nm. This could be caused by an increased share of vaporizable inorganics as shown in Fig 4. An increased amount of inorganic vapor leads to a higher particle number, where a high particle concentration enhances particle coagulation and agglomeration. During this process, particles stick together, the particle number decreases, whereas the mass remains constant. The quantity, form and concentration of aerosols depends on the fuel, fuel preparation, firing system, but also on process conditions, such as stoichiometry and temperature [199]. Stoichiometry most likely affects organic aerosols produced during incomplete or under-stoichiometric combustion. This is often confirmed in small-scale wood fired grates [144]. Gas temperature strongly affects the vaporization of inorganic elements in the fuel, the supersaturation of inorganic vapors in the gas phase and thus, the condensation and formation of aerosols. These phenomena will be discussed within Section 2.5.3.T a g g e d P 2.3.3.

Aerosol emissions from wood stoves under different operation conditions: a) number distribution, and b) mass distribution calculated from original data with the assumption of a constant particle density of 2.5 g/cm 3 (data taken from Nussbaumer et al. [194], originally from Klippel and Nussbaumer [195]). T a g g e d P Table 4 compares different publications dealing with aerosol measurements in all three firing systems. Typical devices that are applied are impactor cascades such as the Berner type low pressure impactor (BLPI), similar compared to an ELPI, the differential mobility analyzer (DMA), the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) or the aerodynamic particle sizer (APS), where the latter two are typically applied in automotive industry. A detailed description and comparison of these devices can be found in literature, e.g. [101,151,158,175,194]. An interesting high-temperature impactor was presented by Brunner et al. [160], which enables studying aerosol formation at higher temperatures. All these devices are highly complex and influenced by various parameters, such as dilution gas in order to prevent agglomeration in the device, the ability of particles to carry electrical charge, particle shape and density, gas temperature and thus gas viscosity and gas density, as well as many more. Therefore, it is not surprising that measurement results scatter significantly. A comparison of different studies should be only qualitatively. When evaluating Table 4, one can see that most studies apply impactors in order to sample aerosols. The highest concentrations of aerosols are found for waste-wood and straw. This can be explained by the relatively high ash content and the fact, that these fuels are rich in alkali metals shown in Table 1. Aerosol concentrations for particles smaller than d p ¼ 1 mm, also referred to as PM 1 , T a g g e d P show values up to 1500 mg/m 3 n as measured by Christensen et al. [149] in a straw-fired grate. Mikkanen [161] showed that around 66% of fly ash can be found in aerosols with d p &lt; 3 mm. For coals, typically smaller numbers are reported, however, many different values can be found in literature. The chemistry of aerosols strongly depends on the parent fuel. Straw leads to aerosols rich in salts mainly composed of KCl and K 2 SO 4 . Aerosols from wood combustion are typically rich in K, Ca, Cl and Mg. On the contrary, bituminous coals lead to S-, Ca-and Si-rich aerosols. As discussed previously, the mode is typically around 100À200 nm, and is dominated by agglomerates. The combustion system can influence aerosol formation, however, there is no clear picture derived from Table 4.Fig. 18.

Therefore, it is not surprising that measurement results scatter significantly. A comparison of different studies should be only qualitatively. When evaluating Table 4, one can see that most studies apply impactors in order to sample aerosols. The highest concentrations of aerosols are found for waste-wood and straw. This can be explained by the relatively high ash content and the fact, that these fuels are rich in alkali metals shown in Table 1. Aerosol concentrations for particles smaller than d p ¼ 1 mm, also referred to as PM 1 , T a g g e d P show values up to 1500 mg/m 3 n as measured by Christensen et al. [149] in a straw-fired grate. Mikkanen [161] showed that around 66% of fly ash can be found in aerosols with d p &lt; 3 mm. For coals, typically smaller numbers are reported, however, many different values can be found in literature. The chemistry of aerosols strongly depends on the parent fuel. Straw leads to aerosols rich in salts mainly composed of KCl and K 2 SO 4 . Aerosols from wood combustion are typically rich in K, Ca, Cl and Mg. On the contrary, bituminous coals lead to S-, Ca-and Si-rich aerosols. As discussed previously, the mode is typically around 100À200 nm, and is dominated by agglomerates. The combustion system can influence aerosol formation, however, there is no clear picture derived from Table 4.</p>

There is a need for guidelines on how to present, calculate and evaluate aerosol measurements and emissions. Many studies do not provide all information that is needed in order to evaluate and interpret their measurement results. Further fundamental work has to be conducted and should be coupled with comprehensive CFD models enabling the prediction of ash deposition and hence, improve sootblowing or plant design. It is believed that aerosol behavior is of great importance for slagging and fouling, in particular for biomassfired boilers. Fig. 19.

Fusion of this silicate envelope leaves burning carbon residue inside, continuously releasing gases.

        <p>T a g g e d P Ash particle structures mainly depend on the raw fuel -size, form and distribution of inorganics -and on the combustion systemplant size, fuel size, grinding, temperatures, stoichiometry and combustion intensity. The first point is often addressed in scientific studies. However, the impact of combustion system on fly ash particle structures has never been studied systematically. It is known that ashes from lab-scale flow reactors and full-scale boilers can differ significantly. Different heating rates and flow velocities can change particle structural development, char fragmentation, and thus, ash formation [105]. However, there are studies, such as the work of Xu et al. [192], reporting relatively good agreement between PSD of ashes from lab-and full-scale. As expected, their data reveals that full-scale systems have much higher particle concentrations [192]. In general, higher temperatures increase the probability of fusion/ coalescence of included mineral grains and enhance burnout. A coal having high numbers of included mineral grains will form coarser fly ash particles with spherical shape when burnt in a PF boiler, compared with low-temperature laboratory ashes, where every mineral grain will form one remaining ash particle, as long as char burnout is identical and sintering does not occur. Char particles within ashes are typically large (50 mm and larger) compared with fly ash particles [193,196]. A comparison of ashes from different combustion systems such as grate, FB and PF using the same parent fuel is challenging. As shown in Fig. 1, grinding, and thus particle size differs significantly, which then affects mineral liberation and residual ash PSD. Furthermore, residence time and temperature profiles differ significantly affecting the whole fly ash formation process. Ashes from grate combustion are typically differentiated into fly ash and bottom ash. In general, bottom ash are known to be significantly larger. For instance, bottom ash particles in MSW combustion systems are in the size range of 0.5À4 mm [197]. Fly ashes collected in grate systems on the other hand are often reported to be rich in submicron ash particles with peaks at around 0.2 up to 0.5 mm, T a g g e d P depending on the fuel and vaporization of inorganics [149,198]. Valmari et al. [189] studied fly ashes from willow combustion in a CFB boiler and found a bi-modal size distribution with peaks at 0.2À0.5 and 5À10 mm, respectively. Some large, irregular and unmolten particles with 100 mm were found indicating incomplete coalescence due to low temperatures [189]. In general, different combustion systems lead to changed fly ashes mainly caused by varying temperature profiles, residence times and parent fuels. T a g g e d P A classification based on chemistry is challenging. Within the same fuel sample, a wide range of chemical compositions and structural variations among fly ash particles, are observed. Coal ashes can produce glassy ash particles, particles containing crystals and intermediates. Therefore, a classification based on chemistry is not recommended. Instead CCSEM data can be a powerful tool, for determining the chemical composition and its variation. Care should be taken, when categorizing ash particles to mineral or ash classes. Instead a list of the raw elemental composition for each ash/mineral particle, might be more useful. T a g g e d P In general, ash particles differ significantly in size, shape, structure and chemistry. This is even more pronounced in case of wastebased fuels or biomass. Both, the shape and chemistry are known to affect the sticking probability. Therefore, it is recommended to use synthetic materials mimicking ash particles, in order to study sticking and rebound behavior under well-defined and controlled conditions. For instance, coal ashes can be simulated using soda-lime glass particles [1,201], or biomass ashes with synthetic salt particles [202,203].T a g g e d P Ash particle structures mainly depend on the raw fuel -size, form and distribution of inorganics -and on the combustion systemplant size, fuel size, grinding, temperatures, stoichiometry and combustion intensity.

The difference between particle impaction and deposition rate are particles rebounding from heat exchangers. The capture efficiency can be calculated as the product of impaction and sticking efficiency. Physical phenomena affecting the transport of particles and vapors in the flue gas are summarized by Couch [15], who refers to an early study by Samms and Watt [207]. These phenomena are particle drag due to the flow, T a g g e d P molecular and Brownian diffusion, thermal and eddy diffusion, as well as gravity and electrostatic effects. Basically, each gradient in a flow field can lead to particle movement, where small particles are typically more prone to these gradients. This can be a gradient of shear forces, the so-called Saffman lift force [208], a gradient in species (referred to as diffusiophoresis) [209] or in turbulence (called turbophoresis), where particles are transported in the direction of lower turbulent kinetic energy [210].

The deposition curve is divided into three different deposition regimes. In the "diffusional deposition regime" (typical for small particles), the deposition velocity V depþ is decreasing with increasing t pþ . This regime is dependent on the particle Schmidt number, Sc ¼ n g =D p ; where D p is the Brownian particle diffusion coefficient. It is dependent on turbulent diffusion of particles from the core of the duct and Brownian diffusion in a very thin layer adjacent to the wall [214,216]. Brownian particle diffusion is the random movement of particles due to collisions with molecules, which becomes important for very small particles, typically in the sub-micron region. Furthermore, it can dominate in laminar flows and within laminar boundary layers. Particles diffuse from regions with high particle concentrations to regions with lower values. This can be interpreted analogously to gas molecular diffusion. The Brownian particle diffusion coefficient D p can be estimated using the Einstein equation (see the work of Young and Leeming [214]). Thermophoresis is caused by Brownian motion of particles. The difference between Brownian motion and thermophoresis is that in the latter case, a temperature gradient in the surrounding of the particle is present. This temperature gradient can exhibit a directed force as introduced in the upcoming Section 2.5.2. The intermediate regime is called "diffusional regime", where a strong increase of deposition velocity is observed.where u * is again the friction velocity, and n g is the kinematic viscosity of the gas (n g ¼ m g =r g ).

The particle's inertia in the near wall region is large enough in order to cross the viscous sub-layer and deposit on the wall. The third "inertia-moderated" regime is not influenced by particle diffusion effects. Large particles having enough momentum from large eddies in the turbulent core reach the wall directly. A slight decrease in deposition rate with increasing particle size is observed. This is explained by the fact that larger particles show less response to turbulence [214]. Much effort has been devoted to the first two regimes in order to derive equations, predicting the particle behavior. However, only recently, advances are reported [216].

The flow around a cylinder, with its recirculation zone in the wake of the tube, is shown by blue streamlines. Particles (black) approaching the cylinder cannot follow the curvature of the streamlines due to their large mass, which forces them to keep the current direction of the trajectory.

Particle impaction on the cylinder rear side is also reported in literature, and is caused by the recirculation zone, which again is a function of the free-stream velocity u 1 . Often, the so-called impaction efficiency h is used to describe the impaction probability of a particle approaching a cylinder in the cross-flow. The impaction efficiency for the T a g g e d P front face of the cylinder can be calculated by:</p>

        <p>1 is the number of particles in the projected area of the cylinder further upstream [206]. Another method of determining the impaction efficiency is by finding the outermost particle trajectory still impacting on the cylinder, as given by the second part of Eq. ( 9). Here, y 0,D 2 3 8 X X max is the maximum vertical distance from the centerline, at which a particle will impact the cylinder surface; see the lower particle track in Fig. 25. The impaction efficiency can be calculated by the vertical distance from the centerline to the starting point of the particle y 0,D 2 3 9 X X max divided by the cylinder radius (D/2) [222]. Eq. (9) requires measurements or numerical simulations. A further way of estimating the impaction efficiency is by using correlations derived from potential flow calculations. These correlations are a function of the particle's Stokes number (h ¼ f ðStÞ). Equations suggested by Brun et al. [223] were extended to regions where the Stokes' law does not apply. The Stokes' law describes the frictional force (also called drag force) for a sphere within a low Reynolds number flow. For small flow velocities the drag force is a linear function of the Reynolds number. At higher Reynolds numbers it deviates from this linear function. Therefore, Israel and Rosner [215] introduced a correction factor c, in order to calculate the so-called effective Stokes number St eff , accounting for this deviation:1 is the number of particles in the projected area of the cylinder further upstream [206].

Small particles with effective Stokes numbers below St eff &lt; 0.125 do not impact according to the correlations. With increasing size, particles start to hit the surface and the impaction efficiency is monotonically increasing, with an increasing Stokes number. Particle impaction probability increases from around 8% for a 12.5 mm particle to around 35%, when doubling the diameter. A parametric study is conducted in Fig. 26(b).

Two examples are shown for an aluminosilicate particle, with a density around r p % 2.5 g/cm 3 , and an iron-rich particle, e.g. hematite, with a density around r p % 5.5 g/cm 3 . It can be seen that particle density is along with the particle diameter a critical parameter.

This force is acting in the opposite direction of the temperature gradient, i.e. from the hot gas towards the cold gas. The force becomes relevant for smaller particles, however, it is still not completely understood [227]. Thermophoresis is often mentioned to be important, but rarely addressed in a scientific way for slagging and fouling in a PF system. Another difficulty is the potential of particle nucleation within the boundary layer, which makes it very difficult to actually quantify thermophoresis. The main reason is due to the complexity of this effect. It is difficult to isolate the thermophoretic force in a deposition experiment, and it is even more complex to measure small thermophoretic forces, which are in the range of 10 À9 À10 À15 N. The effect was first described by Tyndall [228] in the late 19th century, who observed the formation of a dust-free zone near a heated surface (see also the review of Young [227]). Small dust particles immersed in the flow could not reach the surface due to the thermophoretic force acting from the hot to the cold gas.

        <p>T a g g e d P The measurement of thermophoresis is a challenging task due to the small magnitude of this force. Early observations, such as the one reported by Tyndall [228], are strongly influenced by convection of the surrounding fluid. Later experiments focused on single particle studies, in a so-called Millikan cell. This enables the exact measurement of the particle diameter. Charged liquid droplets are held in an electric field between two electrodes, with the field strength E; see also [247À249]. By differential heating of the electrodes, one can establish the following equilibrium e ¢ E ¼ m p ¢ g þ F th ; in which e is the elementary charge, m p is the mass of the particle, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. This equation can be used to calculate the thermophoretic force by knowing the particle mass, which requires an exact determination of the particle size. This enables a direct measurement of the thermophoretic force on droplets or particles in a controlled environment. By changing the carrier gas and its pressure or the particle composition, the value L can be studied at different Kn numbers. T a g g e d P Studies on the role of thermophoresis in combustion systems are rare. An interesting experimental and modeling study with direct relevance and link to slagging and fouling, was presented by Zhan et al. [242]. They used a vertical surface in a 100 kW down-flow laboratory coal combustor in order to study the inner deposit layer formation and the role of thermophoresis within laminar flow. The authors introduced a thermophoresis number Tp being the ratio of the time a particle travels along a cold surface with thermophoresis T a g g e d P and the time a particle would require without thermophoresis by considering only drag. If Tp &lt; 1 particles are captured on the surface. By using this relationship, the authors could show reasonable agreement with measurements. Ash deposition rates increased linearly as the temperature difference between gas and surface increased. Future work will include thermophoresis in CFD codes and validate experiments. T a g g e d P A study [243] predicting the capture efficiency on a cylinder in the cross-flow with and without thermophoresis showed that the capture efficiency for particles with small Stoke numbers increased by three to four orders of magnitude depending on the thermophoresis model and the particle size. Two different models, i.e. Talbot et al. [237] and Young [227], were compared, where the latter one showed a decreased impaction efficiency. Furthermore, it was explained why small aluminosilicates particles experience a higher thermophoretic force compared with iron-rich particles. This is due to an increased thermal conductivity ratio L for iron-rich particles [243]. Lutro [245] conducted a similar study at lower cylinder Reynolds numbers and found similar results for a non-isothermal case. T a g g e d P Beckmann et al. [397] evaluated the influence of thermophoresis on the overall deposition rate using an isothermal plug flow reactor and a comprehensive and detailed CFD model. The CFD model included the effect of thermophoresis by using the model of Talbot et al. [237]. Predicted ash arrival rate on a cooled probe increased depending on the port in the test rig between 7 and 50%. The authors underline the important effect of temperature and the need for an accurate sticking criterion. A similar study was presented recently by Yang et al. [304], who used 2D CFD simulations in order to predict the deposit growth including thermophoresis using again the Talbot model. During early stages, thermophoresis increased the impaction efficiency from 0.02 to around 0.03. This effect diminished with increasing probe surface temperature and time. The authors found that ash deposition is dictated by inertial impaction and the stickiness of particles [304]. T a g g e d P A different conclusion concerning thermophoresis was presented by Sinquefield [244]. He studied the role of different deposition mechanisms using the Multifuel Combustor at Sandia National Laboratories. Conditions from black liquor recovery boilers were T a g g e d P mimicked using sub-micron and micrometer-sized particles together with a dynamic monitoring system for deposit growth rates. Results showed a linear deposit growth accompanied by a highly non-linear temperature increase, ruling out thermophoresis since temperature difference became smaller once the layer thickness increased. Sinquefield [244] showed that the rate remained constant even though the temperature difference dropped significantly, concluding that thermophoresis is not the rate-controlling mechanism. However, as the initial probe temperature was varied, deposition rate changed, indicating some sort of thermal effect. The author instead postulates an inertially-dependent mechanisms based on deposit morphology. Morphology of sub-micron deposits are dendritic with over 90% voidage. Particles are found to have a high sticking efficiency and do not roll or settle subsequent to impaction in the porous structure [244]. T a g g e d P Thermophoresis is a temperature-driven effect, whose relevance during slagging and fouling is not clear yet. At early stages of deposit build-up, it may play an important role, however, detailed validation studies using CFD in order to explain experimental observations are rare in literature. Additionally, the effect of deposit structure is often neglected, mainly due to its complexity. Furthermore, uncertainty due to different correlations is high.T a g g e d P The measurement of thermophoresis is a challenging task due to the small magnitude of this force. Early observations, such as the one reported by Tyndall [228], are strongly influenced by convection of the surrounding fluid. Later experiments focused on single particle studies, in a so-called Millikan cell. This enables the exact measurement of the particle diameter. Charged liquid droplets are held in an electric field between two electrodes, with the field strength E; see also [247À249]. By differential heating of the electrodes, one can establish the following equilibrium e ¢ E ¼ m p ¢ g þ F th ; in which e is the elementary charge, m p is the mass of the particle, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. This equation can be used to calculate the thermophoretic force by knowing the particle mass, which requires an exact determination of the particle size. This enables a direct measurement of the thermophoretic force on droplets or particles in a controlled environment. By changing the carrier gas and its pressure or the particle composition, the value L can be studied at different Kn numbers. T a g g e d P Studies on the role of thermophoresis in combustion systems are rare. An interesting experimental and modeling study with direct relevance and link to slagging and fouling, was presented by Zhan et al. [242]. They used a vertical surface in a 100 kW down-flow laboratory coal combustor in order to study the inner deposit layer formation and the role of thermophoresis within laminar flow. The authors introduced a thermophoresis number Tp being the ratio of the time a particle travels along a cold surface with thermophoresis T a g g e d P and the time a particle would require without thermophoresis by considering only drag. If Tp &lt; 1 particles are captured on the surface. By using this relationship, the authors could show reasonable agreement with measurements. Ash deposition rates increased linearly as the temperature difference between gas and surface increased. Future work will include thermophoresis in CFD codes and validate experiments. T a g g e d P A study [243] predicting the capture efficiency on a cylinder in the cross-flow with and without thermophoresis showed that the capture efficiency for particles with small Stoke numbers increased by three to four orders of magnitude depending on the thermophoresis model and the particle size. Two different models, i.e. Talbot et al. [237] and Young [227], were compared, where the latter one showed a decreased impaction efficiency. Furthermore, it was explained why small aluminosilicates particles experience a higher thermophoretic force compared with iron-rich particles. This is due to an increased thermal conductivity ratio L for iron-rich particles [243]. Lutro [245] conducted a similar study at lower cylinder Reynolds numbers and found similar results for a non-isothermal case. T a g g e d P Beckmann et al. [397] evaluated the influence of thermophoresis on the overall deposition rate using an isothermal plug flow reactor and a comprehensive and detailed CFD model.

Condensation T a g g e d P The condensation of inorganic vapors occurs during cooling, when the flue gas is supersaturated and gas temperature falls beneath the vapor dew point. A fluid is saturated when the vapor pressure of the condensing species equals the saturation pressure of the same species. Condensation on a surface (fly ash particle or heat exchanger) is referred to as heterogeneous condensation. A direct particle formation in the gas-phase is called homogeneous nucleation; see also the work of Wieland [174]. In the case of a clean tube, condensation leads to the formation of a thin, sticky film, which might change the pick-up of other solids [15]. Further condensation effects can occur on fly ash particles or on existing deposits. The amount and chemical composition of inorganic vapors strongly depends on flue gas temperatures, and the fuel itself.

Fig. 29(a) shows the inorganic element vaporization fraction per unit burnout time for a Montana lignite. This study was conducted by Mims et al.

The fraction vaporized x i divided by the burnout time t b is shown as a function of temperature [70]. At T ¼ 2000 K, the value x i /t b yields 5 for Na, implying that around 10% of the sodium in the lignite will vaporize during a burnout time of t b ¼ 2 s. The amount might be even lower for higher-rank coals [57]. On the other hand, condensation is important for fuels with high alkali metal contents, such as biomass. Dayton et al. [251] used a high-temperature reactor coupled with a mass spectrometer, in order to study the release of alkali and chlorine species during switchgrass combustion. Their findings suggest that potassium release mainly occurs during char conversion, with a slight overlap with devolatilization. Chlorine is released as HCl during devolatilization. Adding steam reduced the amount of KCl, and increased the release of KOH [251]. Heterogeneous condensation requires the presence of inorganic vapors at the heat exchanging surface. For typical clean superheater tubes, the flow around the cylinder is in the range of Reynolds number of 500À5000.

        <p>Hydroxides are mainly stable at high temperatures and in systems with low concentrations of sulfur, e.g. when firing biomass. At lower temperatures, chlorides become stable, and even further down the temperature axis carbonates may show up. It is easier to capture hydroxides since their chemistry fits better into the alumina-silicate 3D structure, compared with relatively large chloride molecules. Sulfur has the effect to rise the dew point by forming sulfates that condense [49]. It is concluded that sulfur lowers the time available for reaction between alkali vapors and aluminosilicates, and consequently, the amount of alkali metals scavenged [48]. Fagerstr€ om et al. [46] showed that the number of aerosols in the range of 0.05À1 mm is reduced by more than 70% when co-firing peat with straw. In particular the amount of alkali chlorides decreases leading to less corrosive deposits. High temperatures in the flame can have two effects. On the one hand, vaporization rates increase leading to a higher concentration of inorganic vapors. On the other hand, the absorption of alkali metals in aluminosilicates is much faster at higher temperatures, and thus, it can lead to a decrease in aerosol concentration. Another aspect of chemical reactions is the deposition of unburnt carbon. Typically, this value is below 2 wt.% in fouled deposits, and no unburnt carbon is found in slagging deposits [15]. Unburnt carbon can lead to further reactions and reducing conditions, accompanied with heat and gas release inside deposits.

        <p>T a g g e d P 2.5.5. Further transport mechanisms T a g g e d P There are further transport mechanisms reported in the literature with mostly unknown relevance for slagging and fouling. These mechanisms lead to forces on fly ash particles, change the impaction efficiency, and can therefore influence the deposition process. An often mentioned but rarely addressed transport mechanism is the so-called "eddy impaction". Turbulent eddies in the vicinity of heat exchanging surfaces can accelerate small particles, which are then able to leave the eddy due to their inertia and penetrate the boundary layer. This effect might be important for the wake of a superheater tube (lee side of the cylinder), however, it is only relevant for smaller particles. A further force on particles is induced by "Brownian motion" of molecules affecting the movement of, again, only small particles. Saffman [208] proposed a force induced by shear stresses. It is often referred to as the Saffman lift force and should be included in regions with high shear stresses such as in the vicinity of walls. This force can enhance the deposition velocity of particles, and for deposition calculation a modified expression should be used including effects of the proximity of a wall [216]. The sign of the Saffman lift force depends on the direction of the slip velocity perpendicular to the wall. T a g g e d P Electrophoresis is a force on dispersed particles in an electric field. The force is given by F El ¼ q ¢ E; where q stands for the total charge of a particle. In addition, in the presence of a charged wall, particles can experience an electrostatic force [216]. Guha [216] T a g g e d P uses the parameter ξ to relate the charge of a particle q p to the maximum possible charge q p,max (q p ¼ ξ ¢ q p;max ). Since a furnace has no significant electric fields, this is only of importance for electrostatic precipitators.

Fig. 30 shows the results of his studies. A detailed description of the approach can be found in his works [216,264]. It can be concluded that all three effects have a considerable influence for small particle relaxation times, and thus, small particles. Increasing the surface roughness height k þ s ; leads to a strong increase in the dimensionless deposition velocity (Fig. 30(a)). The value increases by up to three orders of magnitude leading to deposits of fine particles. This is a crucial parameter since a clean and smooth superheater tube only exists at the commissioning of a power plant. After a short period of operation, surfaces collect small particles due to thermophoresis or heterogeneous condensation, and, form dentritic structures. The impact of different electrical charges ξ of particles is shown in Fig. 30 (b). The deposition velocity is again increased, but not as pronounced as by the surface roughness. The maximum electrical charge ξ ¼ 1 leads to an increase in dimensionless deposition velocity of one up to two orders of magnitude for small particles. The effect of temperature difference between the gas and the wall is shown in Fig. 30(c). A similar effect compared to the surface roughness can be observed. A slight temperature increase of DT ¼ 5 K leads to a 25 times higher deposition velocity due to thermophoresis (see Section 2.5.2).T a g g e d P Guha [216], solves a particle continuity equation for a fully developed flow in a turbulent duct in order to study the impact of each mentioned effect. Fig. 30 shows the results of his studies. A detailed description of the approach can be found in his works [216,264]. It can be concluded that all three effects have a considerable influence for small particle relaxation times, and thus, small particles. Increasing the surface roughness height k þ s ; leads to a strong increase in the dimensionless deposition velocity (Fig. 30(a)). The value increases by up to three orders of magnitude leading to deposits of fine particles. This is a crucial parameter since a clean and smooth superheater tube only exists at the commissioning of a power plant. After a short period of operation, surfaces collect small particles due to thermophoresis or heterogeneous condensation, and, form dentritic structures. The impact of different electrical charges ξ of particles is shown in Fig. 30 (b). The deposition velocity is again increased, but not as pronounced as by the surface roughness. The maximum electrical charge ξ ¼ 1 leads to an increase in dimensionless deposition velocity of one up to two orders of magnitude for small particles. The effect of temperature difference between the gas and the wall is shown in Fig. 30(c). A similar effect compared to the surface roughness can be observed. A slight temperature increase of DT ¼ 5 K leads to a 25 times higher deposition velocity due to thermophoresis (see Section 2.5.2).</p>

The main mechanisms leading to removal, according to a review of Zbogar et al. [265], are:</p>

        <p>T a g g e d P Shedding of deposits can be caused by various mechanisms such as gravity, thermally-or mechanically-induced tensions. Thermal tension can be the result of combustion fluctuations, load changes or soot blowing. Mechanically-induced tensions are typically due to soot blowing or mechanical fluctuations, such as vibrations [265,266]. Soot blowers and water cannons use pressurized steam or water and spray it on heat exchanging surfaces in order to cause stresses in the deposit and clean the boiler wall. Fig. 31 shows the effect of soot blowing on steam generation. However, the efficiency of soot blowing strongly depends on the deposit structure, its chemistry, age and location in the boiler. A classification of deposits and the influence of removal mechanisms on deposit types is given in Table 6. Erosion is the process when sharp unmolten particles collide with non-sticky areas on a deposit surface [265]. Typically, in coal-fired boilers, these are quartz particles with relatively high melting points. Erosion, as a gradual removal of material, can be divided into deformation and cutting actions. Deformation is relevant for brittle materials and caused by the normal velocity component of incoming particles, whereas cutting actions are related to the tangential velocity component, and most relevant for ductile surfaces. Raask [12] differentiates between erosion of abrasive, hard, and angular quartz particles, which cause erosion by cutting, and glass particles leading to surface deformation and brittle failure. Main parameters influencing erosion are particle hardness, shape, diameter, impact velocity, and angle of impaction. Table 6 shows that erosion is dominant for the removal of dry, powdery deposits, whereas molten slags are not affected by erosion effects. Gravity shedding is caused by gravitational forces due to the deposit weight, which lead to a break down and/or fracture in the structure [265]. The gravitational force can exceed forces in the bonding of the deposit, or the interface of deposit and steel surface. Large deposits are reported to fall into the ash hopper, causing damage to the tubes. This effect is most relevant for powdery or lightly sintered deposits. Gravity is also causing the removal of molten slags. A thermal shock leads to fracture due to different thermal expansion coefficients of the deposit and the tube material. A sudden shrinkage caused by cooling (e.g. by soot blowing) leads to thermal stresses and failure inside the deposit [265]. This mechanism is more pronounced for sintered deposits, with higher thermal conductivities and lowered porosity values. Removal mechanisms are manifold and dependent on many characteristics, such as deposit strength and structure, cleaning devices inside the boiler, chemical composition and particle characteristics. It is therefore not surprising that modeling of deposit removal is challenging and rare in literature. Fig. 30.

        <p>T a g g e d P Deposit formation is strongly dependent on process conditions inside the boiler and fly ash characteristics, i.e. chemical composition and size distribution, as discussed in the previous section. Main process parameters influencing the extent of slagging (superheater region with molten or partially molten ash particles) and fouling (low temperature region such as economizer with lower flue gas velocities and solid ash particles) are the flue gas temperature, velocity, and composition (reducing or oxidizing environment). Slagged or fouled heat exchanging surfaces lower the heat transfer rate to the water-steam cycle and thus reduce the boiler efficiency and significantly affect the operability. Van Beek et al. [267,268] reported a reduced heat transfer coefficient of 25%, due to the formation of a powdery deposit in the economizer region (fouling layer). In this region, ash particle are solidified due to lowered temperatures; flue gas temperatures are typically between 400 and 600 °C, and steel tube temperatures around 300 °C. During early stages of deposit formation (clean tube), only sub-micron particles can deposit, since their velocity is low enough. Large particles will rebound and possible erode loosely-bound particles [268]. This is confirmed by study of Steadman et al. [269], who observed a thin 10-100 mm thick layer, composed of sub-micron particles.T a g g e d P Deposit formation is strongly dependent on process conditions inside the boiler and fly ash characteristics, i.e. chemical composition and size distribution, as discussed in the previous section.

        <p>At later stages, once the surface roughens and may sinter together, larger particles in the size range of 1-10 mm are reported to deposit and stick [268,270]. T a g g e d P The main reason for deteriorated heat transfer is the low thermal conductivity of ash deposits. A deposit layer has a relatively low thermal conductivity (0.2 &lt; k deposit &lt; 3 Wm ¡1 K ¡1 D 2 4 7 X X), compared to steel tubes (15 &lt; k steel &lt; 57 Wm ¡1 K ¡1 ), leading to a deteriorated heat T a g g e d P transfer from the flue gas to the water-steam cycle. The thermal conductivity of steel depends on its composition. Austenitic steels (such as X8CrNiNb1613) show values around 15 Wm ¡1 K ¡1 , whereas ferritic steels (such as 10CrMo9) have higher values of 35 Wm ¡1 K ¡1 at ambient temperature [271]. Wynnyckyj et al. [272] developed an integrated monitoring system in order to determine boiler performance and a cleaning strategy for heating surfaces by sootblowers. They applied a combination of thermocouples, heat flux meters and pyrometers. A furnace in Saskatchewan, Canada was used to install "dirty" and "clean" heat flux meters directly on the boiler wall. The clean heat flux meters were protected from slagging by purging air, whereas dirty ones were exposed to ash accumulation. Results for heat transfer over time are shown in Fig. 31. This figure clearly reveals a reduced heat transfer when an ash layer builds up. It shows that selective soot-blowing can increase heat transfer rates. This kind of monitoring system is often used to optimize soot-blowing in order to increase steam production, save steam from being used in soot-blowers, and hence, increase overall boiler efficiency. T a g g e d P The temperature profile of a fouled/slagged superheater tube is illustrated in Fig. 32. The curve shows a qualitative profile, and not computed or measured values. The steam temperature inside the superheater tube for typical PF systems is in the range of 400À650 °C depending on the boiler type and the materials used. The heat transfer coefficient at the inner tube wall (number "1" in Fig. 32) is relatively high in the range of 500 &lt; h i,s &lt; 5 000 Wm ¡2 K ¡1 for steam. Even higher values are typical for liquid water with 1 000 &lt; h i,w &lt; 10 000 Wm ¡2 K ¡1 or a water-steam mixture with 15 000 &lt; h i,w/s &lt; 600 000 Wm ¡2 K ¡1 [35]. The outer heat transfer coefficient (number "4" in Fig. 32) depends on whether radiation is present or not, and is typically in the range of 30 &lt; h o &lt; 100 Wm ¡2 K ¡1 . Heat transfer in the radiant section is controlled by the heat flux and flame temperature, whereas the convective heat exchange is dominated by the temperature difference between the flue gas and the water-steam-cycle. In the case of radiative heat exchangers, this implies a lowered heat transfer coefficient through deposits. The temperature profile is shifted downstream and furnace exit temperature increases.

Deposit porosity, chemistry and temperature strongly influence thermal conductivity (see Section 3.9). During deposit growth, larger particles are able to stick leading to irregular surfaces structures. As the layer grows and consolidates, the surface temperature increases towards that of local gases [15,274].

Heat conduction through the initial layer shows a relatively low value, due to the small layer thickness, and is comparable to the resistance caused by the steel tube.

        <p>T a g g e d P Predictions of deposit formation and growth over time are illustrated in Fig. 35(a) and (b). Wagoner and Yan [278] predicted changing deposit shape for different tube diameters, flue gas velocities, particle diameters and densities, by considering inertial impaction. The model predicts an increase in deposit layer thickness, when tube diameter decreases, and, flue gas velocity, particle diameter or density increases. The model reveals a high sensitivity towards particle diameter and velocity, and thus the particle kinetic energy. However, the deposit formation is highly over predicted. The layer formed within six hours at a tube temperature of 593 °C indicating a missing sticking criterion. Tomeczek and Wac»awiak [253] conducted two-dimensional CFD simulations for different tube longitudinal pitches and particle sizes. The free-stream flue gas velocity is set to u 1 ¼ 8.36 m/s. Their study shows the influence of particle size in particular on the cylinder rear. In general, the deposit formation on the cylinder front is considerably higher compared with the cylinder rear, which agrees with observations from power stations. T a g g e d P The formation of ash deposits on superheater tubes and water walls is illustrated in Fig. 36. The surface temperature of a clean superheater tube, e.g. at the commissioning of a power plant, is around 0.5À10 K higher than the water-steam temperature and thus significantly lower than flue gas temperatures. Ash particles impacting on the cold surface solidify and rebound. The initial layer is formed by heterogeneous condensation [15] or the migration of small particles to the surface. Inorganic vapors cool down in the boundary layer, start to saturate, and condense either directly on the surface or to sub-micron particles which are then captured. The inner layer is rich in K/Na, S and Cl, while the outer layer is often more slag like, porous and rich in Ca, Si, Al, Fe and other elements depending strongly on what fuel is fired. The outer layer is often reported to be loosely bound and can be more easily removed by soot-blowing compared with the inner layer. This inner layer is typically white, composed of alkali-or earth alkali-compounds and tightly bound, as shown in Fig. 37 T a g g e d P However, if KCl deposits as a condensed aerosol or as a vapor is not completely understood. The exact role of aerosols during initial layer formation is unknown. Aerosols might act as glue and probably accelerate consolidation and chemical reactions. They fill up gaps and voids, and thus, increase contact area between particles. Jensen et al. [289] studied deposition rates in straw-fired grate boilers using a deposition probe simulating superheater coils. Results are shown in Fig. 38. An increase in aerosol concentration resulted in higher deposition rates. These findings were confirmed for two different boilers. Furthermore, their study revealed that the potassium content in the raw fuel correlates well with deposition rates. Again a T a g g e d P linear increase in deposition rate with increasing K-content in the fuel was found. Sinquefield [244] collected deposits using submicron particles simulating ash deposition in black liquor boilers. He found a dendritic structure composed of long chains and strings of particles growing radially outwards. The author reported sintering of particles in these chains, however there was little contact between different chains [244]. Kaufmann et al. [281] also showed the importance of aerosols during deposit formation, when firing herbaceous biomass. The authors found sub-micron particles in the deposit and explained their deposition due to thermophoresis. An overview on typical deposition rates for different fuels and firing T a g g e d P systems can be found in Table 7. It can be seen that most experimental studies report values around 20À100 g/(m 2 ¢ h). The deposition rate mainly depends on the flue gas temperature, as well as the fuel quality. Bashir et al. [284] showed that deposition rate was influenced by flue gas temperature and straw-share, while changes in probe surface temperature had no significant influence. This suggests that large particles are controlled by the gas temperature and are not affected by boundary layer effects. On the contrary, aerosol temperatures is not crucial assuming that these particles cool down in the boundary layer. Aerosol sticking seems to be independent of their temperature. However, confirmation for this behavior is needed. Weber et al. [287] reported a similar finding, where the deposition rate and thus the sticking efficiency strongly increased with increasing fly ash particle temperatures. Highest sticking efficiencies were found for a bituminous coal ash followed by sawdust and mixed wood, where lowest values are reported for low melting ashes from grain and fermentation residues. There was no relation between sticking efficiency and ash softening temperatures or calculated viscosity values found. A possible explanation could be an increased collection efficiency of a porous deposit -in the case of bituminous coal -compared with a molten layer -grain and T a g g e d P fermentation residues -as shown in Fig. 71(a) and discussed later on. Every incoming particle is captured in a porous layer, whereas when a molten layer exists, particles travel around this smooth surface. Kupka et al. [285] found increasing deposition rates with increasing co-firing shares of sewage sludge, when fired with a bituminous coal. This was caused by the low melting ashes of sewage sludge. A high deposition rate was reported when firing RDF [286]. A relatively high carbon content in the deposit might be caused by the condensation of tars. Much lower deposition rates are reported for the initial layer formation in a bituminous coal-fired boiler [188], probably due to low quantities of aerosols and alkali vapors. Furthermore, this table indicates that CFD studies are likely to over estimate deposition rates. The time required to form an initial layer is relatively long and can take several weeks. Condensation is particularly important for lignites and biomass with high shares of organicallybound inorganics. As the layer grows, the surface temperature increases and the formation of a liquid interface starts collecting ash particles. In the next step, larger ash particles start to adhere and form a powdery deposit. Again, the thicker the layer gets, the smaller is the temperature difference between the flue gas and the deposit surface. The deposit changes the flow around the tube and therefore the impaction process. Particle impaction on the water wall is shown in the lower part of Fig. 36. It is dependent on the configuration of the tubes, i.e. whether the tubing is vertical or in a meandering pattern. There are also publications reporting a deposit growth starting at the bridge in between tubes, due to increased surface temperatures at those locations [288]. Once the deposit layer grows, it can form a molten slag layer threatening boiler operation, as shown in the bottom right corner. T a g g e d P Fig. 39 shows a compilation of photographs taken from various power plants [288]. Typical areas affected by ash deposition are presented. Fig. 39 shows:T a g g e d P Predictions of deposit formation and growth over time are illustrated in Fig. 35(a) and (b). Wagoner and Yan [278] predicted changing deposit shape for different tube diameters, flue gas velocities, particle diameters and densities, by considering inertial impaction. The model predicts an increase in deposit layer thickness, when tube diameter decreases, and, flue gas velocity, particle diameter or density increases. The model reveals a high sensitivity towards particle diameter and velocity, and thus the particle kinetic energy. However, the deposit formation is highly over predicted. The layer formed within six hours at a tube temperature of 593 °C indicating a missing sticking criterion. Tomeczek and Wac»awiak [253] conducted two-dimensional CFD simulations for different tube longitudinal pitches and particle sizes. The free-stream flue gas velocity is set to u 1 ¼ 8.36 m/s. Their study shows the influence of particle size in particular on the cylinder rear. In general, the deposit formation on the cylinder front is considerably higher compared with the cylinder rear, which agrees with observations from power stations. T a g g e d P The formation of ash deposits on superheater tubes and water walls is illustrated in Fig. 36. The surface temperature of a clean superheater tube, e.g. at the commissioning of a power plant, is around 0.5À10 K higher than the water-steam temperature and thus significantly lower than flue gas temperatures. Ash particles impacting on the cold surface solidify and rebound. The initial layer is formed by heterogeneous condensation [15] or the migration of small particles to the surface. Inorganic vapors cool down in the boundary layer, start to saturate, and condense either directly on the surface or to sub-micron particles which are then captured. The inner layer is rich in K/Na, S and Cl, while the outer layer is often more slag like, porous and rich in Ca, Si, Al, Fe and other elements depending strongly on what fuel is fired. The outer layer is often reported to be loosely bound and can be more easily removed by soot-blowing compared with the inner layer. This inner layer is typically white, composed of alkali-or earth alkali-compounds and tightly bound, as shown in Fig. 37 T a g g e d P However, if KCl deposits as a condensed aerosol or as a vapor is not completely understood. The exact role of aerosols during initial layer formation is unknown. Aerosols might act as glue and probably accelerate consolidation and chemical reactions. They fill up gaps and voids, and thus, increase contact area between particles. Jensen et al. [289] studied deposition rates in straw-fired grate boilers using a deposition probe simulating superheater coils. Results are shown in Fig. 38. An increase in aerosol concentration resulted in higher deposition rates. These findings were confirmed for two different boilers. Furthermore, their study revealed that the potassium content in the raw fuel correlates well with deposition rates. Again a T a g g e d P linear increase in deposition rate with increasing K-content in the fuel was found. Sinquefield [244] collected deposits using submicron particles simulating ash deposition in black liquor boilers. He found a dendritic structure composed of long chains and strings of particles growing radially outwards. The author reported sintering of particles in these chains, however there was little contact between different chains [244]. Kaufmann et al. [281] also showed the importance of aerosols during deposit formation, when firing herbaceous biomass. The authors found sub-micron particles in the deposit and explained their deposition due to thermophoresis. An overview on typical deposition rates for different fuels and firing T a g g e d P systems can be found in Table 7. It can be seen that most experimental studies report values around 20À100 g/(m 2 ¢ h). The deposition rate mainly depends on the flue gas temperature, as well as the fuel quality. Bashir et al. [284] showed that deposition rate was influenced by flue gas temperature and straw-share, while changes in probe surface temperature had no significant influence. This suggests that large particles are controlled by the gas temperature and are not affected by boundary layer effects. On the contrary, aerosol temperatures is not crucial assuming that these particles cool down in the boundary layer. Aerosol sticking seems to be independent of their temperature. However, confirmation for this behavior is needed. Weber et al. [287] reported a similar finding, where the deposition rate and thus the sticking efficiency strongly increased with increasing fly ash particle temperatures. Highest sticking efficiencies were found for a bituminous coal ash followed by sawdust and mixed wood, where lowest values are reported for low melting ashes from grain and fermentation residues. There was no relation between sticking efficiency and ash softening temperatures or calculated viscosity values found. A possible explanation could be an increased collection efficiency of a porous deposit -in the case of bituminous coal -compared with a molten layer -grain and T a g g e d P fermentation residues -as shown in Fig. 71(a) and discussed later on. Every incoming particle is captured in a porous layer, whereas when a molten layer exists, particles travel around this smooth surface. Kupka et al. [285] found increasing deposition rates with increasing co-firing shares of sewage sludge, when fired with a bituminous coal. This was caused by the low melting ashes of sewage sludge. A high deposition rate was reported when firing RDF [286]. A relatively high carbon content in the deposit might be caused by the condensation of tars. Much lower deposition rates are reported for the initial layer formation in a bituminous coal-fired boiler [188], probably due to low quantities of aerosols and alkali vapors. Furthermore, this table indicates that CFD studies are likely to over estimate deposition rates. The time required to form an initial layer is relatively long and can take several weeks. Condensation is particularly important for lignites and biomass with high shares of organicallybound inorganics. As the layer grows, the surface temperature increases and the formation of a liquid interface starts collecting ash particles. In the next step, larger ash particles start to adhere and form a powdery deposit. Again, the thicker the layer gets, the smaller is the temperature difference between the flue gas and the deposit surface. The deposit changes the flow around the tube and therefore the impaction process. Particle impaction on the water wall is shown in the lower part of Fig. 36. It is dependent on the configuration of the tubes, i.e. whether the tubing is vertical or in a meandering pattern. There are also publications reporting a deposit growth starting at the bridge in between tubes, due to increased surface temperatures at those locations [288]. Once the deposit layer grows, it can form a molten slag layer threatening boiler operation, as shown in the bottom right corner. T a g g e d P Fig. 39 shows a compilation of photographs taken from various power plants [288]. Typical areas affected by ash deposition are presented. Fig. 39 shows:</p>

Furthermore, it is known to be crucial for deposit shedding [265]. The material strength is usually governed by the yield stress Y, a quantity above which a material deforms irreversibly. Below this value, the material deforms elastically upon load, and once the load is removed, it retains its original shape. A typical material test yielding the stressstrain curve is the tensile test. The stress-strain curve for steel and a brittle material are illustrated in Fig. 40. The stress expressed as load per area (N/mm 2 ) is determined by measuring the force applied to a specimen.

Within the proportional region, the slope of the stressstrain curve reveals the materials elasticity, referred to as Young's modulus E and given by Eq. ( 41). Typically, brittle materials such as ceramics have a considerably higher Young's modulus compared with steel. Analogously, the shear modulus G of a solid, elastic material can be determined. The shear modulus describes the deformation, which takes place when a force is applied parallel to one face of an object while the opposite face is fixed by another equal force. A further important quantity describing the response of a material is the Poission's ratio n. It relates lateral strain to longitudinal strain.T a g g e d P easily by creeping.

        <p>The material properties Y, n and E are well documented for steel and other materials at room temperature. A compilation of typical values is given in Table 8. Even though values have been quantified for ash particles [296], glass or minerals such as quartz or mullite, the variation among reported values can be high and temperature dependence is often unknown. Fig. 41 shows Young's modulus as a function of temperature for different materials. Most of the measurements are conducted for temperatures below 1000 °C and with increasing temperature, a decrease in Young's modulus is observed, except for vitreous SiO 2 [294]. However, it is mentioned that a decrease is expected at higher temperatures. The lower curve shows values for soda-lime glass measured by Marx and Sivertsen [292]. Data is extrapolated towards the melting temperature determined either with an ash melting microscope or predicted using thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. Uncertainty in this region is high. The Poisson's ratio is often reported to slightly increase with temperature, but again literature is not consistent and materials behave differently. Furthermore, particle structures vary significantly and material properties for structures such as agglomerates are difficult to determine. Therefore, it is doubtful that temperature-dependent data for various ash particle compositions and structures can be found. Ai and Kuhlmann [297] used the following temperaturedependent relation T a g g e d P where a and b are fitting parameters. They used deposition experiments for coal fly ash particles of different size, in order to fit coefficients a and b for the prediction of Young's modulus. However, it is questionable if results are applicable for other experiments, and the influence of chemistry is missing. Here more effort for temperatureand composition-dependent correlations is needed, similar to work of Roberts and Garboczi [298], who presented a model for elastic constants as a function of porosity.The material properties Y, n and E are well documented for steel and other materials at room temperature.

        <p>T a g g e d P The melt fraction is often used to describe the stickiness of ash particles, or the flow behavior of slags, in entrained flow gasifiers. The melt fraction f p of ash particles is the total mass of liquid phases or components within an ash particle or, more general, in a system, relative to the overall mass. It is usually defined by weight, and can take values from zero to unity, according to the following equation:T a g g e d P The melt fraction is often used to describe the stickiness of ash particles, or the flow behavior of slags, in entrained flow gasifiers.

It is usually defined by weight, and can take values from zero to unity, according to the following equation:</p>
        <p>where m p,liquid and m p,solid are the liquid and solid particle mass, respectively. A method measuring the melt fraction is the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Fig. 42 shows the signal of a T a g g e d P differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This data is derived from simultaneous thermal analysis (STA), where the temperature and mass change of a sample to an inert reference sample is continuously recorded during constant heating. The signal is shown in a DSC-Tplot of an ash sample. The irregular shape or peaks of the signal identifies endothermic melting events, reactions or phase transitions, while sample mass remains constant. Changes in sample mass usually indicate thermal decomposition and release of gases or chemical reactions with the surrounding gas. By assuming, that the melt fraction is proportional to the area of the DSC signal over temperature, the following equation can be used to interpret the melt fraction:where m p,liquid and m p,solid are the liquid and solid particle mass, respectively.

        <p>where A is the area underneath the measured curve to a certain temperature (shown in Fig. 42) and A tot the total area. The above equation leads to a continuous melting curve as shown in the melt fraction-temperature plot in the bottom illustration of Fig. T a g g e d P Besides the fact that the composition of individual mineral inclusions or ash particles can differ significantly from the bulk ash, the composition of a single particle can consist of multiple species and is influenced by a multitude of different reactions. In order to obtain a fundamental understanding of phase transitions and melting processes it is of crucial importance to investigate systems with only few components to isolate single effects and reduce cross sensitivity T a g g e d P or influences from other reactions. To understand the single mechanisms thermodynamic equilibrium calculations (TEC) are often used to predict stable phases in dependence of different parameters, e.g. composition, temperature, or atmosphere. The thermodynamic equilibrium is based on the minimization of the Gibb's enthalpy, which is implemented in various commercial software codes, such as 
            <rs type="software">FactSage</rs> thermochemical software and databases [306] or 
            <rs type="software">Chem-App</rs> [307]. The results are plotted in so-called phase diagrams. An example is shown in Fig. 44, for the binary system KCl-K 2 SO 4 . The solid black lines denote phase transitions. The blue dashed line shows exemplarily a system of constant composition of KCl and K 2 SO 4 , which is heated from 500 to 900 °C. After exceeding the temperature at point 3, the first liquid phase occurs, but K 2 SO 4 is still in the solid phase. Exceeding 850 °C at point 2, the solid phase K 2 SO 4 gets liquefied. Both components (KCl and K 2 SO 4 ) are entirely in the liquid phase at point 1. When evaluating results it is important to consider that the thermodynamic equilibrium represent an ideal stable state after infinite time. Reaction rates or catalytic effects cannot be included. T a g g e d P A comparison of STA measurements and results from the phase diagram is shown in Fig. 43. Results are presented for the vertical blue line in Fig. 44 using a system composed of 15 mol.% KCl and 85 mol.% K 2 SO 4 . Hansen et al. [87] conducted STA measurements for different binary salt mixtures, as well as for straw and coal ashes. Salt mixtures show a good repeatability; the melting onset is determined within 10 °C and the melt fractions at a given temperature within 10% when compared with phase diagrams. Ash samples T a g g e d P showed lower melting temperatures, between 50 and 100 °C when compared with the ash fusion test results [87]. The authors suggest to use CCSEM results to identify individual melting events recorded in the STA curve. A more complex ternary phase diagram for K 2 O-CaO-SiO 2 , can be seen in Fig. 45. This figure can explain the troubling behavior of straw ash compared with wood ash. Straw ash particles are typically composed of K-silicates, having an eutectic melting temperature as low as 750 °C, at a mixture of 70 wt.% SiO 2 and 30 wt.% K 2 O. On the contrary, Ca-rich particles have melting temperatures above 1500 °C (not shown for pure CaO) and thus a low stickiness and adhesiveness. In real combustion systems, particles are compounds of even more than three species and equilibrium is not reached due to small time scales complicating the application of phase diagrams. Nevertheless, they can be a useful indicator explaining certain ash behavior. Another application was presented by Jak [310]. The author used thermodynamic equilibrium calculations in order to predict the ash melting behavior. Results are calculated for Al-Ca-Fe-O-Si systems, and compared with ash fusion test results. Results show good agreement underlining the capability of theoretical predictions. Masi a et al. [311] studied biomass and waste ashes using leaching methods, STA and thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. STA measurements did not prove to be suitable for their ashes. In contrast, equilibrium calculations showed good results and are recommend by the authors for the determination of the melt fraction. Wieland et al. [312] found that the predictions from STA are shifted towards higher temperatures, compared to results from thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. Differences are explained by heat transfer limitations and reaction kinetics. Babat et al. [186] explained iron-rich deposits collected in a full-scale power station using thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. The authors could show that pyrite forms low melting eutectics in reducing conditions, where melting starts at temperatures as low as 950 °C. In general, TEC or STA methods provide useful information on the melting behavior of ashes, however they have to be applied with care. For predictions using TEC, databases have to be selected, which are not fully available for the vast set of ash chemistry systems, in particular for biomass or waste ashes. Furthermore, these predictions assume infinite time and kinetics of chemical transformations cannot be T a g g e d P considered. Kinetics are known to be important for instance for relatively slow pyrite transformation.

        <p>T a g g e d P The dynamic viscosity m (sometimes h is used instead) of ashes or slags is frequently applied in modeling studies. Sticking criteria are often based on particle viscosity, and flow behavior of slags in entrained flow gasifiers is mainly described by its viscosity. Typical slag flow is occurring when the dynamic viscosity is in the range of m slag ¼ 15D 2 8 2 X XÀ25 PaD 2 8 3 X X ¢ D 2 8 4 X Xs, at temperatures of around 1400À1500 °C, depending on the fuel and ash composition [313]. At these temperatures, slag can be described as a Newtonian fluid, where viscous stresses are linearly proportional to strain rates. However, once the slag cools down, crystals can form in the melt, and the slag can no longer be treated in such a way. This transition point is often defined as the critical viscosity temperature T cv [16], and is shown in Fig. 46. The temperature viscosity curve changes abruptly at T cv [323]. This temperature is time dependent and strongly affected by the crystal formation rate and thus, there might be no single value. Instead, the temperature of critical viscosity can change over time. Nevertheless, attempts were made for an estimation. In order to find viscosity values, empirical relations were developed, relating slag composition and temperature to measured viscosity values [314]. Nicholls and Reid [315] were the first to observe that at a given viscosity the gradient of the viscosity-temperature curve is similar for all coal ash slags within the Newtonian region. This behavior is expressed by the following equation [314]:T a g g e d P The dynamic viscosity m (sometimes h is used instead) of ashes or slags is frequently applied in modeling studies.

Browning et al. [314] give a brief overview on advances in describing slag viscosity by empirical equations. Another good review is provided by Vargas et al. [323]. Table 9 shows a selection of viscosity models, available in literature. There are more models available, in particular in the glass industry or vulcanology. Mathematical descriptions of the models can be found in the Appendix AD 2 8 8 X X. Early models, such as the one by Watt and Fereday [319] or the S 2 -correlation, were developed for British coals with a limited range of application (only valid for a certain range of Si and Fe content, as shown in Table 9). A widely used model considering different elements and their role in the melt was proposed by Urbain [321]. They used the analogy of slag and glass melts. They fitted viscosity measurements of different SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO systems to the Weymann-type equation [314,321]. Kalmanovitch and Frank [322] re-evaluated the data of Urbain [321], and modified their equations for improved accuracy. They included all major ash forming elements into the proposed equations, calculating the coefficients a and b. But still, the range of applicability was limited to high temperatures, with viscosity values m &lt; 10 3 PaD 2 8 9 X X ¢ D 2 9 0 X Xs.

Fig. 46 compares different slag viscosity measurements for two coal ashes with high silica content (Reid [324] -glassy coal ash slags with SiO 2 % 57 wt.%, and Oh et al. [325] -Sufco coal ash with SiO 2 % 60 wt.%), and three other coal ashes with medium SiO 2 content (Pittsb. #8, Shenfu, Boadian, with SiO 2 &lt; 50 wt.%). The glassy slags do not show a change in slope at given temperatures. It is assumed that the change will occur at lower temperatures, as mentioned by Senior and Srinivasachar (when m ¼ 10 4 PaD 2 9 3 X X ¢ D 2 9 4 X Xs). The three other coals with low silica content show a steep increase in the dm/dT-slope at around 10D 2 9 5 X XÀ20 PaD 2 9 6 X X ¢ D 2 9 7 X Xs, which is considerably lower than those of glassy slags. The slope parameter B in Eq. ( 46) increases from around B ¼ 1:1 to B ¼ 6:4. All coals show a similar slope in the low-and high-temperature regime, underlining the validity of Eq. ( 45). Often, the change in slope is referred to as the critical temperature T cv . Different approaches have been used to predict the critical temperature. Sage and McIlroy Fig. 46.

A change in the slope can be observed for the latter class at lower temperatures.where a, and b are composition-dependent fitting parameters. Eqs. ( 46) and ( 47) are commonly used and fitted to a set of slag compositions and temperature-viscosity measurements. Browning et al. [314] give a brief overview on advances in describing slag viscosity by empirical equations. Another good review is provided by Vargas et al. [323]. Table 9 shows a selection of viscosity models, available in literature. There are more models available, in particular in the glass industry or vulcanology. Mathematical descriptions of the models can be found in the Appendix AD 2 8 8 X X. Early models, such as the one by Watt and Fereday [319] or the S 2 -correlation, were developed for British coals with a limited range of application (only valid for a certain range of Si and Fe content, as shown in Table 9). A widely used model considering different elements and their role in the melt was proposed by Urbain [321]. They used the analogy of slag and glass melts. They fitted viscosity measurements of different SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO systems to the Weymann-type equation [314,321]. Kalmanovitch and Frank [322] re-evaluated the data of Urbain [321], and modified their equations for improved accuracy. They included all major ash forming elements into the proposed equations, calculating the coefficients a and b. But still, the range of applicability was limited to high temperatures, with viscosity values m &lt; 10 3 PaD 2 8 9 X X ¢ D 2 9 0 X Xs.

        <p>T a g g e d P The elements Ti 4+ and P 5+ can also act as glass formers, similar to Si 4+ . Modifier ions lead to a lowered viscosity by disrupting the glass structure. The last group can act as a glass former in combination with a modifier ion by balancing their charge and thus forming a stable metal oxygen anion group fitting into the silicate network [316]. However, when modifier ions are missing in the mixture, amphoteric cations can act as modifiers themselves. This behavior of the elements is often used in the glass industry or for example by Senior and Srinivasachar in order to develop a model for the viscosity of coal ash particles. Their goal is to provide a model being able to predict the ash particle viscosity, based on ash composition for a wide range of temperatures. This region includes the beginning of particle sticking at around m ¼ 10 4 À10 8 PaD 3 1 6 X X ¢ D 3 1 7 X Xs [316]. Therefore, they used a high-and low-temperature regime in which the dm/dT-slope changes. In contrast, the majority of viscosity models only focuses on the region of high temperatures, in which the slag acts as a Newtonian fluid. However, at lower temperatures, crystals may form in the melt, leading to a sharp increase in viscosity as shown by Fig. 46 [106]. A compilation of ash particle viscosities for different fuel ashes and chemical compositions can be seen in Fig. 47(a). The measured viscosity ranges over a wide span from 10 À3 for liquid salts to 10 5 PaD 3 1 8 X X ¢ D 3 1 9 X Xs for coal slags and glasses. The lowest values are observed for salts even at temperatures as low as 800 °C. High viscosity values can be found at low temperatures, e.g. for glassy slags, but also at high temperatures as soon as crystals form in the melt. In general the viscosity of ash particles from straw combustion exhibit lowest T a g g e d P values followed by woody ash and coals. However, variations in chemistry among different ash particles within one sample can lead to a different order. T a g g e d P Browning et al. [314] recently published an interesting approach, in which they investigated 1715 data points of 117 slag compositions, and developed an empirical equation similar to Eq. ( 45). The temperature shift is calculated composition-dependent and is given in Appendix AD 3 2 0 X X. The authors suggest that potassium acts as a network former, unlike Urbain [321], who counted K + to the network modifiers. The reason why potassium increases the viscosity is its effect on the amphoteric aluminum oxide in the slag. They further state that the model is not valid for alumina-free samples containing K 2 O [314]. A comparison of models and measured viscosities is shown in Fig. 47. The best agreement for the high-temperature regime is achieved with the correlation suggested by Browning et al. [314]. Viscosity models not shown in Fig. 47 showed larger deviations. None of the models is able to predict the changing slope at lower temperatures. It is concluded that viscosity can be predicted relatively well in the region of high temperatures for typical coal slags. However, predicting ash particle viscosity at lower temperatures and with a highly variable composition is still challenging. The model of Senior and Srinivasachar [316] is validated for glassy slags containing modifiers. However, if particles have no modifiers or high Fe or Ca contents in the absence of Si, the correlation might yield unsatisfying results. Nevertheless, this model is the only available one in literature being capable of predicting the viscosity at lower temperatures of 800À1300 °C, which are typical for ash particle deposition in a boiler. T a g g e d P In general, there is a need for better viscosity models in particular for Ca-rich or salt-rich ashes -typical for biofuels. Vargas et al. [323] compared viscosity models and their predictive capabilities with a number of viscosity measurements mainly for silicates. Best performance was attributed to the model of Bottinga and Weill [320]. Another model showing good agreement with measurements, is the model of Browning et al. [314]. However, both are only valid for silicates in a certain range of composition and in the Newtonian region at high temperatures. Therefore, more fundamental work should be directed towards models for biomass ashes and for lower temperatures. T a g g e d P A method considering the formation of crystals in the melt, and their influence on the viscosity, was presented by a number of studies. Vargas et al. [323] present an overview on models relating the solid fraction of crystals in the melt to the viscosity of the mixture T a g g e d P m mix and the liquid phase m liq , respectively. The models differ in their complexity -all models consider the amount of crystals and some can consider the crystal shape. Vargas et al. [323] describes two classes, models for dilute suspensions with mostly spherical crystals such as the work of Einstein [334], Vand [335], Sherman [336], Roscoe [337], and models for dense slurries, e.g. Quemada [338]. A validation of these models is beyond the scope of this work, however, data of Oh et al. [325] is used to compare model predictions. Therefore, the viscosity of the melt is predicted using the composition of the Pittsburgh #8 ash and a fit of the model of Browning et al. [314]. The measurements and predictions are shown in Fig. 48(a) as points and dashed line, respectively. Relatively good agreement is observed at high temperatures. With decreasing temperature, a sharp increase of the measured viscosity is observed at around 1270 °C due to crystal formation. The fraction of crystals (solids) in the melt is determined using thermodynamic equilibrium calculations (FactSage and the FToxide database [306]). The blue curve shows the fraction of solids as a function of temperature. First crystals are predicted at around 1650 °C. A significant increase in the solid fraction is observed at around 1350 °C.

        <p>T a g g e d P The fluid flow behavior, often referred to as rheological behavior, of coal ashes and/or slags is complex and controversy. Fluids are classified as time-independent fluids or time-dependent fluids. Both are illustrated in Fig. 49. The most common time-independent fluid is a Newtonian fluid describing most gases and liquids. Viscosity is expressed as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate. Pseudoplastic fluid, often called shear-thinning material, shows a decrease in viscosity with increasing rate of deformation. The fluid is termed plastic, if this effect is very strong. Typical examples are polymeric Within shorter periods, the material is deformed and recovers to its original shape after deformation [341]. Losurdo et al. [342] used viscoelatic models to describe ash behavior. This is an interesting approach, however experimental confirmation for this behavior is still due.

[343] investigated the flow behavior of coal ash slags, using a high-temperature rheometer. The effect of shear rate and temperature on viscosity are studied between 1200 and 1340 °C. The authors found that the sensitivity of slag viscosity to temperature variation decreased with increasing shear rate. They observed a thixotropic behavior, which could be related to the formation of crystalline phases during cooling. Vargas et al.

One technique is the so-called Moza-Austin sticking test [349]. A pellet of mineral or ash is formed, and held in the center of a ring burner flame, until it melts and falls onto a pretreated steel specimen (typically oxidized), maintained at a certain temperature relevant for heat exchangers.

        <p>3.9. Thermal conductivity and radiative properties T a g g e d P Thermal conductivity and radiative properties of deposits define the temperature profile in the deposit and thus, heat transfer to the water-steam cycle as illustrated in Fig. 32. Therefore, these parameters are of importance not only for modeling studies, but also for boiler operation. Heat transfer through the deposit is often expressed by an effective thermal heat conductivity, k eff that combines heat conduction and radiation which might occur in parallel or in series [273]. Radiation increases the heat conductivity through a porous deposit by penetrating the inside structure and absorption of radiation. Heat conduction through a deposit can then be expressed as one-dimensional, transient heat transfer through a cylindrical shell by:3.9.

        <p>T a g g e d P The deposit porosity p dep has the strongest impact on the thermal conductivity. A decrease in porosity leads to an increase in the effective thermal conductivity, and enhances heat transfer. Robinson et al. [358] found that the initial layer has a relatively low thermal conductivity due to its particulate structure and relatively high porosity. However, in the case of biomass, this layer can consist of condensates and therefore have a molten, dense structure and high conductivity. Outer layers show a sintered structure with strongly increased thermal conductivities. Fig. 54(a) shows measurements of deposit thermal conductivity with varying porosity values. Rezaei et al. [246] measured the thermal conductivity for a set of different coal ashes. The porosity strongly depends on the deposit type. It decreases in the order of: powdery &gt; particulate &gt; sintered &gt; molten type of deposit. Typical values range from 0.1 for molten deposit with gas inclusions, up to 0.9 for a looslybound, powdery deposit layers [358À360]. The porosity is reduced with time due to sintering. This causes a densification of the deposit, and thus, an irreversible increase in effective thermal conductivity [273]. T a g g e d P Fig. 54(b) shows the influence of temperature on measured thermal conductivities. As a general rule, a slight increase in thermal conductivity with increasing temperature, can be observed. Rezaei et al. [246] found that the change in thermal conductivity, is more pronounced at higher temperatures. They explain this behavior by sintering. Above temperatures of 600À800 °C sintering occurs, leading to an irreversible change in morphology and thereby a change in deposit thermal conductivity. Gupta et al. [357] found coal ash sintering between 900 and 1200 °C. This change in structure and particle connectivity leads to a higher thermal conductivity during the cooling of the sample, as shown in Fig. 54(b). A description of the measurement device can be found in the work of Rezaei et al. [246]. Anderson et al. [361] give another explanation for the strong increase at higher temperatures: Thermal radiation is causing an increase, at temperatures above 500 °C. Their measurements show a strong increase at around 1200 °C, which might also be due to fusion of the sample. The samples of Rezaei et al. [246] did not show a significant change in porosity after cooling. They explained the increased thermal conductivity during cooling by sintering, which caused a better connectivity between the individual particles, but only a slight change in porosity. Zbogar et al. [273] give a further explanation, based on changes in emissivity upon structural changes. T a g g e d P Not much literature is available on the influence of particle size on heat conductivity.

        <p>T a g g e d P Both unsintered ash samples show an increased thermal conductivity by 30% to 100%, when coarse particles are used. But the authors do not explain this behavior. The review of Zbogar et al. [273] found an increase with increasing particle size at higher temperatures, whereas at low temperatures no change is observed. A possible explanation are changed radiative properties for larger particles. Wall et al. [362], found a sharp decrease in deposit absorbance, a dep , for an initial layer composed of small, sub-micron particles. They further state that small particles reflect most of the incident radiation, whereas large particles show a high absorbance. T a g g e d P The influence of the chemical composition dominates the sintering and melting behavior of ash deposits and therefore also its structure and thermal conductivity. Rezaei et al. [246] found only small changes at identical sample porosities. But they refer to the glass industry, where correlations were developed yielding an equation for a composition-dependent thermal conductivity [366]. Raask [12] found a lowered sintering temperature for iron-rich slags, and, thus, an increased thermal conductivity. This is confirmed by comparing thermal conductivities of different materials, as shown in Table 11. It can be seen that glasses (silica-rich) have a considerably lower thermal conductivity, compared to magnetite (Fe 2 O 3 ). A volume-weighted correlation might be suitable to calculate the thermal conductivity of the mixture [273,362]. Wall et al. [367] also state that the chemical composition affects emissivity. The presence of coloring agents, such as iron, leads to an increased absorptivity, and, thus, a higher deposit temperature, which then influences sintering and deposit properties. An interesting approach is presented by Mills et al. [368] relating the thermal conductivity of a solid ash particle k p at room temperature to its chemical composition. The authors use NBO/T ratio, defined as the ratio of non-bridging oxygens to tetrahedral/bridging oxygens in a melt (see [14] or the Appendix A, T a g g e d P Eq.

Fig. 57(a) shows the melting temperature of aluminum particles as a function of particle size. Different theoretical studies are in agreement with measurements of Eckert et al. [373].

        <p>T a g g e d P Fig. 58 shows five possible scenarios of a particle (molten, partially molten or solid) impacting on a clean, solid substrate. The 62), ( 67) and ( 68) are calculated with ɛ dep ¼ 0:8. T a g g e d P particle impacts at an angle ', with a well-defined kinetic energy. The particle kinetic energy E p;kin ¼ 1=2 ¢ m p ¢ v 2 p ; without rotational energy, depends on the particle mass m p and its velocity v p . A particle will remain on the surface ( 2), if its kinetic energy is dissipated during the collision. If the particle kinetic energy is higher than the energy dissipated during collision, it will rebound (1) [290,384,385]. The dissipation of energy can be due to deformation, friction between particle and surface, or adhesion [222]. Typically, it is distinguished between an elastic and an inelastic D 3 3 5 X XÀ sometimes referred to as plastic D 3 3 6 X XÀ collision. An elastic collision is defined as a collision of two bodies, where there is no loss in kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of two bodies after collision equals to their total kinetic energy before the encounter. This type only occurs in theory, when there is no conversion of kinetic energy into other forms such as heat. An inelastic collision, in contrast, is a collision in which kinetic energy is converted in other forms. There are energy losses due to e.g. internal friction, plastic deformation, vibrations and others. Ash particles occur as pure solids, liquids and mixtures [323], and are therefore assumed to collide inelastic, with and without plastic deformation. Examples of collisions with plastic deformation are particles with low viscosity values at high temperatures spreading during impact (3). Particles deform at the surface and retain their deformed shape, either due to cooling and solidification, or low surface tensions. The maximum spread diameter d p,max is frequently used to describe this phenomenon. This type of impaction can be identified by deformed ash particles found in the cross-section of a deposit. Splash (4) or rebound with breakup ( 5) are not reported for ash particles due to their relatively high viscosity and high surface tension. T a g g e d P The forces acting on a particle settled on a substrate are shown in Fig. 59. The particle is in contact with the surface, forming an interface, which depends on particle and surface properties. The contact diameter d p,max (also called spread diameter) mainly depends on the particle viscosity, surface tension/energy and roughness. The contact angle Q c is typically large for ash particles, which indicates poor adhesiveness, low wettability due to high surface tension, and low free surface energy. This behavior can also be observed for a liquid water droplet on a hydrophobic surface. The forces acting on the particle can be divided into forces acting parallel and perpendicular T a g g e d P to the substrate. Parallel forces are drag, friction and shear forces induced by the flow in the boundary layer. Perpendicular forces are lift, buoyancy, gravity, thermophoresis, and surface forces, being caused by adhesion or van der Waals forces. Depending on the geometry, forces can act in different directions, in particular for a superheater tube. Another parameter affecting particle sticking can be due to shock cooling upon impaction on the surface. The temperature difference between flue gas and clean heat exchanger can be as high as DT ¼ T 1 À T W ¼ 500 K, leading to a rapid cooling of ash particles within the boundary layer and/or during the impaction. Here, the Biot number plays an important role, whether there is a temperature gradient inside the particle (Bi &gt; 0.1), or not (Bi 0.1). The Biot number is defined as Bi ¼ h ¢ d p =k p ; where h is the total heat transfer coefficient between particle and flue gas. The effects taking place in the boundary layer are rarely addressed in literature. Despite this lack, many different particle sticking criteria have been developed. They can be classified in three main groups -sticking criteria based on the melt fraction of a solid particle, based on the particle viscosity or based on energy conservation during the collision.T a g g e d P Fig. 58 shows five possible scenarios of a particle (molten, partially molten or solid) impacting on a clean, solid substrate. The 62), ( 67) and ( 68) are calculated with ɛ dep ¼ 0:8. T a g g e d P particle impacts at an angle ', with a well-defined kinetic energy. The particle kinetic energy E p;kin ¼ 1=2 ¢ m p ¢ v 2 p ; without rotational energy, depends on the particle mass m p and its velocity v p . A particle will remain on the surface ( 2), if its kinetic energy is dissipated during the collision. If the particle kinetic energy is higher than the energy dissipated during collision, it will rebound (1) [290,384,385]. The dissipation of energy can be due to deformation, friction between particle and surface, or adhesion [222]. Typically, it is distinguished between an elastic and an inelastic D 3 3 5 X XÀ sometimes referred to as plastic D 3 3 6 X XÀ collision. An elastic collision is defined as a collision of two bodies, where there is no loss in kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of two bodies after collision equals to their total kinetic energy before the encounter. This type only occurs in theory, when there is no conversion of kinetic energy into other forms such as heat. An inelastic collision, in contrast, is a collision in which kinetic energy is converted in other forms. There are energy losses due to e.g. internal friction, plastic deformation, vibrations and others. Ash particles occur as pure solids, liquids and mixtures [323], and are therefore assumed to collide inelastic, with and without plastic deformation. Examples of collisions with plastic deformation are particles with low viscosity values at high temperatures spreading during impact (3). Particles deform at the surface and retain their deformed shape, either due to cooling and solidification, or low surface tensions. The maximum spread diameter d p,max is frequently used to describe this phenomenon. This type of impaction can be identified by deformed ash particles found in the cross-section of a deposit.

Table 14 summarizes reference and critical viscosity values, found in literature. A large variation between 2 and 10 9 PaD 3 4 6 X X ¢ D 3 4 7 X Xs, can be seen. This variation can have several reasons. The chemistry and melting behavior can have an influence, where at a given viscosity one particle is sticky and another is not. Another reason could be different particle velocities. Studies with low critical/reference viscosity used relatively high particle velocities (Walsh et al. [395] with 15 m/s and experiments of Liebetruth et al. [396] are estimated around 8 m/s). This would indicate a dependence on particle kinetic energy. Another problem is the use of bulk ash chemistry and bulk ash viscosity values. Bulk ash can have significantly higher viscosities compared to individual ash particles forming low-melting eutectics for example. A large number of modeling studies use bulk ash chemistry and results can be misleading. T a g g e d P Srinivasachar et al. [1] conducted experiments with soda-lime glass particles. The advantage of such a material is that there are no particle-to-particle variations in density, structure or chemical composition, and it has a well-known temperature-viscosity curve. Furthermore, it is reported to behave similar to coal ashes [1]. They used a heated laminar flow furnace, and placed the deposition probe in a conical section. The fluid velocity can be set by changing the position within this conical section. Narrow-sized soda-lime glass particles (28D 3 4 8 X XÀ53 and 53D 3 4 9 X XÀ74 mm) were used to fix particle kinetic energy. At a given kinetic energy, the temperature in the system is varied and the threshold, at which sticking begins is determined. This temperature corresponds to the critical viscosity value. Fig. 60 shows the particle kinetic energy E p,kin as a function of critical viscosity m p,crit . With increasing particle kinetic energy, a lower particle viscosity and thus higher temperature is needed for a particle to stick. In other words, the smaller a particle the higher its sticking Experiments for very small particles are missing. A further binary sticking criteria was proposed by Richards et al. [408]. They define a particle as sticky, when the particle viscosity is below the ash melting viscosity. However, the melting viscosity is difficult to determine and various definitions exist in literature.

They applied this model to simulate glass particle deposition experiments, conducted at ECN, and also used in the study of Schulze et al. [201]. Glass particles in the size of 71À105 mm are injected in a lab-scale methane combustor. Particles are then collected on a steel tube maintained at 500 °C with a surrounding gas temperature of 1200 °C. The simulation shows adequate results and the authors recommend this model. T a g g e d P Wall et al. [414] compared literature data on the critical velocity below which the particle will adhere to the surface. The critical velocity strongly depends on the particle size, and increases with decreasing particle diameter. Different material combinations yield different slopes, ranging from ¡0.39 to ¡6.11 as shown in Fig. 61. Dong et al. [420] determined the critical velocity of fly ash particles on stainless steel, however, only at room temperatures. Their data show a strong dependence on the diameter with the highest slopes. A difficulty is the inhomogeneity in fly ash, where particles are not perfectly spherical and differ in chemistry. The authors report that the majority of fly ash particles is composed of quartz and mullite [420]. This data should be extended to higher temperatures, where the ash softens, and impact behavior changes. There is currently no theory incorporating all energies involved during impact and rebound, and thus being able to predict different rebound behavior shown in Fig. 61. Table 16 summarizes major experiment using solid particles impacting on a solid substrate. Typically, this data is used to set up and validate models including elastic and plastic deformation effects. Table 16 focuses on particle impaction studies with diameters and velocity values relevant for ash deposition. Again, studies using high temperatures are not available. Furthermore, the majority uses exotic materials, mostly polymers or metals, with limited application to ash deposition. T a g g e d P Brach and Dunn [428] derived a mathematical model for the impaction of micrometer-sized spheres, at moderate velocities and arbitrary angles of impaction on a flat substrate. According to the authors, the model can be applied for solids, for spheres in the transition regime between solid and liquid (i.e. viscoelastic, elastic-plastic), and other materials or combinations. Assumptions of this model, are that the processes of adhesion and material deformation, are independent of each other. They argue that energy loss due to adhesion only occurs during rebound [428]. The model is validated using experimental data from the impaction of ammonium fluorescein spheres against a molybdenum surface. The model is based on Newton's law, the conservation of momentum, and given by: T a g g e d P where P n is the resultant normal impulse, P def is the impulse due to particle deformation, P ad is the impulse of the adhesion force and the impulse P ext is caused by external forces such as van der Waals forces or electrostatic forces [428]. These external forces lead to a lower particle rebound velocity and therefore to a higher sticking probability. The proposed model does not include external forces, however, they can be incorporated. Another, external force might be caused by thermophoresis, which is not included in this study or any other study. By using expressions for the individual terms in Eq. ( 82), the authors describe the critical velocity by: ;T a g g e d P where v n , v t and e n , e t are the normal and tangential velocity components and restitution coefficients. The calculation of the restitution coefficients is not given in their publication. If v tot,r v p,crit the particle is assumed to stick. They applied this model to simulate glass particle deposition experiments, conducted at ECN, and also used in the study of Schulze et al. [201]. Glass particles in the size of 71À105 mm are injected in a lab-scale methane combustor. Particles are then collected on a steel tube maintained at 500 °C with a surrounding gas temperature of 1200 °C. The simulation shows adequate results and the authors recommend this model. T a g g e d P Wall et al. [414] compared literature data on the critical velocity below which the particle will adhere to the surface. The critical velocity strongly depends on the particle size, and increases with decreasing particle diameter. Different material combinations yield different slopes, ranging from ¡0.39 to ¡6.11 as shown in Fig. 61. Dong et al. [420] determined the critical velocity of fly ash particles on stainless steel, however, only at room temperatures. Their data show a strong dependence on the diameter with the highest slopes. A difficulty is the inhomogeneity in fly ash, where particles are not perfectly spherical and differ in chemistry. The authors report that the majority of fly ash particles is composed of quartz and mullite [420]. This data should be extended to higher temperatures, where the ash softens, and impact behavior changes. There is currently no theory incorporating all energies involved during impact and rebound, and thus being able to predict different rebound behavior shown in Fig. 61. Table 16 summarizes major experiment using solid particles impacting on a solid substrate. Typically, this data is used to set up and validate models including elastic and plastic deformation effects. Table 16 focuses on particle impaction studies with diameters and velocity values relevant for ash deposition. Again, studies using high temperatures are not available. Furthermore, the majority uses exotic materials, mostly polymers or metals, with limited application to ash deposition. T a g g e d P Brach and Dunn [428] derived a mathematical model for the impaction of micrometer-sized spheres, at moderate velocities and arbitrary angles of impaction on a flat substrate. According to the authors, the model can be applied for solids, for spheres in the transition regime between solid and liquid (i.e. viscoelastic, elastic-plastic), and other materials or combinations. Assumptions of this model, are that the processes of adhesion and material deformation, are independent of each other. They argue that energy loss due to adhesion only occurs during rebound [428]. The model is validated using experimental data from the impaction of ammonium fluorescein spheres against a molybdenum surface. The model is based on Newton's law, the conservation of momentum, and given by: T a g g e d P where P n is the resultant normal impulse, P def is the impulse due to particle deformation, P ad is the impulse of the adhesion force and the impulse P ext is caused by external forces such as van der Waals forces or electrostatic forces [428]. These external forces lead to a lower particle rebound velocity and therefore to a higher sticking probability. The proposed model does not include external forces, however, they can be incorporated. Another, external force might be caused by thermophoresis, which is not included in this study or any other study. By using expressions for the individual terms in Eq. ( 82), the authors describe the critical velocity by: ;</p>

Liquid droplet impacting a solid smooth surface T a g g e d P The impaction of liquid droplets on a solid surface has been investigated in a large number of studies, often in the T a g g e d P field of internal combustion engines, aiming at the deposition of fuel droplets on walls [436À438], fundamental studies using water or alcohol droplets impacting on various solid surfaces [390,435,439À444], or, spray coating [445]. Most studies are used to develop mechanistic or semi-empirical models describing the impaction process for variable droplet sizes, viscosities, surface tensions at different impaction angles and speeds. Fig. 63 shows the stages of a low viscosity droplet such as water impacting on a flat solid surface. The schematic is based on the work of Chandra and Avedisian [435], who used a camera system in order to record different stages of droplet impaction and deformation. Particle or droplet impaction on a solid substrate can be divided into six consecutive stages. Fig. 63 illustrates different stages for a low viscosity liquid. The incoming particle of size d p and impact velocity v p starts to wet the substrate during stage "1". This process is strongly dependent on the contact angle Q c between the surface and the droplet, which depends on liquid properties and surface characteristics. Young's equation given by Eq. ( 52) can be used to relate the contact angle to the surface tension and surface energy. At stage "2", the maximum spread diameter d p,max is reached and the kinetic energy approaches zero. At this point, the droplet height finds its minimum h p,min . During the next two stages, the droplet starts to deform back to a sphere and oscillate, forming the maximum height at stage "4". At stage "5" the droplet either rebounds or sticks, depending on energy dissipation during previous stages. For a low viscosity droplet the sticking probability is quite high due to large deformations. However, splashing is untypical for ash particles since viscosity is still high compared to liquids such as water or gasoline. [449]). This differentiation is used to establish regime maps, as shown in Fig. 64. The droplet Weber number is used in combination with the substrate temperature in order to differentiate between a sticking, rebound and splash regime.

Fig. 65(b) illustrates the process of deposit formation. A clean tube collects only sticky particles, which then solidify as long as the layer is thin [395]. With an increasing deposit layer, the surface temperature increases becoming sticky itself, causing an increase in collection efficiency. Non-molten, dry ash particles can adhere to a sticky surface.

However, within solid fuel-fired boilers different and much more complex scenarios can occur. Fig. 66 summarizes a number of possible phenomena. Ash particles can be trapped by a molten sticky layer, as outlined in the previous section. Furthermore, a solid, powdery deposit can act as a filter element for particles. The flow might be able to penetrate the inside of the deposit, however, the particles are not. They are collected by the porous structure. Condensation and/or chemical reactions of alkali vapors with fly ash particles can change the stickiness as found by Wibberley and Wall [406]. A thin, low viscosity layer forms around silicate ash particles and allows particles to deposit on a cooled steel surface (600 °C) free from condensed material [406]. Another mechanisms is the cementation of solid fly ash particles. Particles impacting on the surface are followed by a molten droplet acting as a glue between the surface and the fly ash particle. This mechanism, however, is difficult to verify in experiments. A further interesting aspect is the deposition of unburnt char containing molten and/or solid ash grains.

Alkali chloride or alkali sulfate vapors begin to condense on the oxide layer. Reactions between Cl/S and the oxide layer further increase the growth and porosity, where the porosity might be caused by the release of volatile metal chlorides. Furthermore, it was found that an increasing Kcontent in the ash leads to a strong increase in oxide layer thickness, as shown in the SEM images (c)À(e) in Fig. 67. . Detachment can occur due to thermal stresses or growth stresses between different layers. An increase in surface temperature leads to an accelerated particle collection promoting ash deposition. The temperature increase is caused by the insulating oxide layer and/or by detachment and insulating gas between oxide layers.

According to this theory, particles smaller than d p ¼ 2 nm will rebound. This controversy effect is known as thermal rebound [473]. However, for ash deposition it is most likely not relevant, since, even aerosols are significantly larger. As shown in Fig. 70, all larger particles will stick. Since typical combustion aerosols are much larger, with sizes around 100-300 nm, it is confirmed that these particle will stick no matter of bulk flow conditions or temperatures. However, a recent experimental study reported a different behavior for nanoparticles. Rennecke and Weber [468] used for the first time a low pressure impactor in order to determine the critical velocity of nanometer-sized NaCl and Ag particles on a mica substrate, avoiding contact charging. The authors used the JKR theory assuming full plastic failure of the particle during the approach regime, adhesion during particle rebound and constant hardness as well as constant surface energy during collision.

Rennecke and Weber [468] found a relatively steep curve for the particle critical velocity, which implies that particles around 50 nm rebound above velocities much smaller than predicted by the JKR and B-H model. They further showed a relatively high critical velocity for porous NaCl particles compared with dense NaCl particles. This is useful information for aerosols, which are typically agglomerates, and thus, also porous. Hence, it is assumed that agglomerates dissipate much kinetic energy during collision due to deformation and rearrangement and, thus, have a high sticking probability. It was further predicted that very small particles experience plastic deformation, which is in contradiction to previous studies assuming that aerosols impact perfectly elastic. There are many unknown phenomena and to date there are only few experiments in this area.

T a g g e d P Two important characteristics for aerosol deposition on heat exchanging surfaces are illustrated in Fig. 71. Fig. 71(a) shows the effect of a porous deposit layer collecting all incoming particles. If particles are small, inertia is low and the probability of shedding diminishes. All incoming particles are collected no matter if they are sticky or not. A second important parameter is the particle shape. As illustrated in Fig. 71(b) agglomerates impact on a wall, deform and rearrange their structure. It is assumed that a large fraction of the particle kinetic energy is dissipated during this process, leading to an increased sticking efficiency of agglomerates compared with perfectly spherical ash particles. However, further work in this field is needed. T a g g e d P Further frequently cited aerosol deposition models can be found in health studies dealing with particle deposition in the respiratory tract. Typical particle capture efficiencies as a function of particle size can be seen in Fig. 72. These models incorporate particle impaction and sticking efficiency in the form of the capture efficiency. It can be seen that very small and coarse particles are captured within the respiratory tract, whereas only 20À30% of particles with a size of around 400 nm reach the surface and stick. The capture efficiency depends on the breathing frequency and the tidal volume, and thus, the channel diameter. Various, mostly empirical models have been developed and used to validate experimental results. Predictions show that only smallest particles are able to travel down to the alveolar, whereas larger particles deposit much earlier in the bronchial and extrathoracic tract. In general, an increased capture efficiency is observed for a larger tidal volume, probably caused by lower velocities and increased residence times.

        <p>T a g g e d P Modeling solid fuel combustion, ash formation and deposition started using one-dimensional stand-alone tools. There are various studies reporting good agreement of ash formation models with measurements, such as the work of Kang et al. [477,478], who calculated time-dependent char combustion and coalescence of ash grains with a cluster composed of char and ash sites. In this model, oxidation leads to particle shrinkage and partial coalescence of ash or char fragmentation. Monroe [23] studied ash formation at the MIT and developed a stand-alone tool based on Monte Carlo simulations of single coal particles for the prediction of ash formation. An interesting work was proposed by Charon et al. [85] and Barta et al. [72], the so-called "urn"-model, as mentioned earlier. This model enables the prediction of ash PSD and chemistry, simultaneously. A number of eleven mineral classes is used, which might be too low in order to predict the vast variance among fly ash particles, and their chemistry. Nevertheless, the approach is promising. Another highlight is the work of Wilemski and Srinivasachar [104], who used a scaled Monte Carlo simulation for mineral distribution. Char conversion includes a fragmentation model and considers different char structures. Good agreement for a bituminous coal is reported, whereas a second coal fails. The authors underline the importance of knowledge on the non-random mineral distribution and char structure. In general, most of the above mentioned stand-alone models report relatively good agreement with measured particle size distribution. These fundamental models are much more sophisticated compared with current CFD methods. Models predicting both, ash PSD and chemistry, are rare and require in-depth fuel characterization methods. Early deposition models used an Eulerian approach and go back to Friedlander and Johnstone [217]. In this model, there is no slip between the gas flow and the particle velocity. The concentration of particles in the flow parallel to the wall, is used to estimate a deposition rate. It is assumed that turbulent diffusion to T a g g e d P particle transport towards the laminar sublayer. Only particles with high velocities are able to penetrate through this layer. However, this velocity has to be estimated and leads to high uncertainties. Baxter and DeSollar [13] developed the standalone code ADLVIC, which includes inertial impaction, thermophoresis, condensation, chemical reactions and uses bulk ash composition in order to predict the deposit chemistry. A good agreement with measurements is reported. Further standalone tools are included in the "Fuel Quality Advisor" developed at the Electric Power Reasearch Institute (EPRI). They include FOULER and SLAGGO, which have several submodels for ash formation, mineral transformation, and ash deposition. They predict the heat penalty caused by deposits. A similar code is developed at the University of North Dakota called LEADER predicting fouling propensities inside a boiler [57]. An inclusion of these or other sophisticated models in a CFD code enables the prediction of fuel conversion, slagging and fouling locations, their extent, and the optimization of operation or design. However, the incorporation of such standalone models into CFD codes is lacking behind [70]. Often too simple models are used, which may lead to wrong conclusions. A comprehensive overview of CFD studies on industrial boilers or pilot-scale test-rigs, is given in Table 21. Most studies on predicting ash deposition can be found for PF systems. There are some studies dealing with grate and FB combustion, however, modeling the combustion and ash formation process in fixed or moving beds is challenging. An overview on CFD studies dealing with FB can be found in the work of Singh et al. [479]. T a g g e d P Among the pioneers in using CFD codes for the prediction of slagging and fouling are the studies of Boysan et al. [398], who calculated the rate of char impacting on walls, Richards et al. [408], and Wang and Harb [480]. Both of the latter two studies used the PCGC code, developed at the Brigham Young University. Richards et al. [408] applied two-dimensional simulations for a 1 MW th test facility to calculate deposition rates. A first three-dimensional model was applied for a PF boiler, by Wang and Harb [480]. The PCGC code uses a different particle treatment compared with Lagrangian tracking, where particle clouds and their transport are calculated instead of individual tracks. Particle impaction and deposition rates are estimated based on particle concentrations near the walls. The authors use the viscosity concept of Walsh et al. [395] to calculate the deposition of a representative number of particles. The positions, at which slagging and fouling rates were predicted inside a boiler, were reduced to approximately 100À200 [480] and deposition rates were interpolated in between. Pseudo-transient calculations are used to account for deposit stickiness. A highlight is the use of CCSEM data, which enables the prediction of deposit chemistry. Many of today's CFD studies are still not able to predict chemistry and do not consider individual particle composition. T a g g e d P Lee and Lockwood [492] studied ash deposition of three British coals in a small combustion test rig using the CFD code CINAR. They use CCSEM data to predict fly ash composition in a pre-processor. A specified number of particle size classes and chemistry classes are used. This enables the prediction of deposit chemistry. Lee and Lockwood [492] used a critical velocity and viscosity approach. Particles with a velocity higher than the critical value are able to reach the wall. In the next step the viscosity decides whether a particle sticks or not. An increased iron deposition was found for early stages, whereas in later stages, the deposit composition was similar to the fly ash. T a g g e d P Bo zic̀[184] used the code FLOREAN of University of Braunschweig to predict mineral transformation and deposition. He used a post-processor and included 50 mineral matter transformation processes, in which chemical reactions and their kinetics, diffusion limitations, fusion, crystal and glass formation are incorporated. This process is highly complex, but enables studying the role of atmosphere and time on ash deposition. This model was further used and improved by Strelow [488]. Both report a relatively good agreement T a g g e d P with measurements in test facilities and conducted calculations for full-scale boilers. An interesting approach is presented by Bernstein et al. [481], in which they conducted coupled calculations between the fireside and the water-steam cycle. By using such a method, more appropriate boundary conditions, in particular temperatures, can be obtained for the fouling and slagging propensity.

        <p>T a g g e d P In the early 2000's, modeling studies for biomass combustion and ash deposition emerged; mainly in the Scandinavian region. Pyyk€ onenD 3 9 6 X X and Jokiniemi [99], developed a condensation model for the formation of alkali chloride aerosols. The transport of aerosols is computed using a general dynamic equation in the Eulerian frame of reference. In this equation, additional velocity components on particles due to thermophoresis or Brownian diffusion are incorporated leading to aerosol deposition. Three deposition paths are identified, which are the formation of sub-micron fume particles in the flow and their deposition via thermophoresis, the direct condensation of vapors on heat exchangers, or the nucleation of finest particles in the boundary layer during cooling and their deposition. Kaer [497] conducted CFD simulations on a straw-fired grate using ANSYS CFX. In a later study, Fluent was used instead [360]. The simulations include the release of combustible gases and fly ash particles from a grate model. The model considers both fine sub-micron particles similar to Pyyk€ onenD 3 9 7 X X and Jokiniemi [99], and coarse fly ash particles. Melting curves were obtained using thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and used for an ash particle sticking criterion. Location, amount and chemistry of ash deposits were predicted and were inline with observations during real operation. Lepp€ anen et al. [103] developed a condensation model for the sub-micron particle formation in a Kraft recovery boiler burning black liquor, a residue of the paper industry. The modeling included particle dynamics and equilibrium chemistry for alkali compounds in a full, three-dimensional CFD model of the boiler. Fine particle transport is modeled using the Eulerian formulation and deposition is calculated based on a similar approach as used by Pyyk€ 
            <rs type="software">onenD</rs> 3 9 8 X X and Jokiniemi [99], considering diffusion effects and thermophoresis. The model is partially validated with measurements from heat exchanging surfaces. The predicted chemistry of particles extracted from the flue gas agrees well with model results. T a g g e d P The majority of studies mentioned above estimate the amount of ash accumulation using the particle concentration near the wall and the concept of the deposition velocity, e.g. see [360]. The actual calculation would require a highly resolved boundary layer, and the exact geometry of thousands of convective heat exchanger tubes. Single tube studies were conducted by Tomeczek and Wac»awiak [253], Haugen and Kragset [226], Venturini et al. [496], Weber et al.
        </p>
        <p>[206], P erez et al. [300À302]. Typically, all these studies do not include combustion and ash formation processes. Ash particles are injected in a small domain, such as the flow around a superheater tube. Tomeczek and Wac»awiak [253] were among the first to present an interesting deposit built-up model accounting for the forming layer. Later on, Weber et al. [206,384] identified an important and crucial aspect when predicting impaction rates of small T a g g e d P particles. If the boundary layer is not resolved properly by a specified number of nodes in radial as well as circumferential direction, impaction rates for small Stokes numbers St &lt; 1 are highly overestimated. This is crucial in particular for predicting the deposition of particles with small sizes and clean tubes. Furthermore, this effect can explain relatively high deposition rates predicted by early CFD studies as shown in Table 7. The group of Weber [206,384] recommends to place at least one node in radial direction within the displacement thickness and 384 nodes around the cylinder circumference in order to accurately predict particle tracks and deposition rates. P erez et al. [301,302], who used a highly-resolved grid, studied the deposition of small ash particles on tubes using unsteady simulations. They developed a comprehensive energy-based sticking criterion, found time-dependent deposition around the full circumference of the tubes and vortexes between the tubes affecting ash deposition. A further model including a dynamic built-up by grid manipulation was presented [300]. By using this model, they found that tube arrangement affected vortexes and by this also deposition rates. T a g g e d P An important question is, how to use information from CFD simulations for practical aspects, such as boiler operation and optimization. First of all, if predictions are able to accurately predict locations of deposit formation, the position of soot-blowers as well as sootblowing intervals can be optimized. Furthermore, this allows to design flow paths as well as the ideal location for the injection of additives.

        <p>T a g g e d P critical particle velocity was found to depend on the impact angle [419] and on the particle size [414]. The study of Wang and John [419] showed that at constant impact velocity v i and with decreasing impact angle ' i , the critical velocity v p,crit decreased. Wall et al. [414] conducted a large number of experiments on the collision of different-sized particles with surfaces. Different material pairs were investigated by varying both, particle and substrate. The authors studied the collision over a broad spectrum of particle impact velocities (1 m/s &lt; v i &lt; 100 m/s). They found a critical particle velocity, which decreases with increasing particle size. Fig. 74 shows the restitution coefficient e, as a function of the impact velocity v i , for a normal impact experiment. The results are obtained using ammonium (NH 4 ) fluorescein particles with varying size on molybdenum (Fig. 74(a)) and tedlar surfaces (Fig. 74(b)). It can be seen that the critical velocity depends on the particle size and the substrate when comparing both figures. The softer surface tedlar leads to a larger critical velocity and lower restitution coefficients. The particles of size d p ¼ 2.58 mm show a critical velocity of around 10 m/s, which decreases to around 3.8 m/s on a molybdenum substrate. The rebound velocity strongly increases with increasing impact velocity, reaching to a uniform value of e % 0.8, for all particle sizes. This behavior is explained by a strong decreasing ratio of E ad /E kin , i.e. the relevance of adhesive forces decreases with increasing impact velocities [222]. Wall et al. [414] furthermore observed a decreasing restitution coefficient at very high impact velocities (v i &gt; 100 m/s).

        <p>T a g g e d P Often, the restitution coefficient e is measured as a function of the particle normal impact velocity v i,n .

Fig. 75(a) shows measurements on the restitution coefficient e ¼ v n;r =v n;i as a function of the normal impact velocity v i,n . The data taken from Dunn et al. [424], was obtained using Ag-coated glass spheres on a stainless-steel surface. Given intervals show the scattering within which 95% of all data were found. It can be seen that the restitution coefficient increases with increasing impact velocity until a material-dependent, steady-state value of around e % 0.8 is reached. No decrease is observed indicating that no plastic deformation occurred. Dong et al. [420] studied the normal rebound behavior of fly ash particles, with a size of 75 § 5 mm, which were mainly composed of quartz and mullite. A maximum value of e % 0.43 was observed followed by a decrease at higher impact velocity values. A similar behavior was found with the same device and material in an accompanying study as shown in Fig. 75(b). The role of particle size was studied and higher restitution coefficients were observed for larger particle sizes probably caused by higher kinetic energy. Interesting is the point where the restitution coefficient decreases, which is shifted to higher values when using larger particle sizes. They relate this phenomena to the work needed to break the connection between the two bodies. A possible explanation for the relatively low values of e is the particle shape, which was not perfectly spherical.D 4 1 2 X X T a g g e d P Thornton and Ning [290] developed a mathematical description of the restitution coefficient for adhesive elastic and adhesive elastic- T a g g e d P plastic spheres. In the latter case, plastic deformation occurs after the particle deforms elastically, as shown in Fig. 73. The model for both scenarios is based on the theory of Johnson,Kendall and Roberts [431], commonly known as the JKR-theory. According to this theory, when two colliding surfaces come into contact, the normal force between the two bodies drops to a certain value (defined in [290]), due to van der Waals attractive forces. The velocity of the impacting sphere is then reduced gradually, accompanied with elastic wave propagation into the substrate. The incoming (loading) stage is completed as soon as the contact force reaches the maximum value, and the velocity reduces to zero. During the recovery stage, the stored elastic energy is then released and converted into kinetic energy moving the particle in the opposite direction. The work done during the loading stage is then recovered, but the particle still remains adhered to the surface caused by adhesive forces [290]. This idea is used in Eq.

In the case T a g g e d P of elastic deformation, the maximum stress distributes as shown in Fig. 77(a) according to the Hertz theory [507] and Hertz pressure distribution.

A comparison of Eqs. ( 125) and ( 126) with experimental values of Li et al. [516] is shown in Fig. 79(a). The rebound angle can be calculated using the continuous line of Fig. 79(b), Eqs. ( 124) and ( 125). The result is illustrated in Fig. 80(a). At low impaction angles, higher rebound angles are predicted. However, the random distribution of rebound angles cannot be covered. The random rebound angle, often mentioned in experimental studies, can be explained by Fig. 80(b). The microscopic surface is rough and small particles barely hit the surface at the macroscopic angle. Therefore, following the suggestion of P erez et al. [301] to use a probability function to calculate a random rebound angle, seems meaningful. However, the limit of these angles should be determined experimentally. P erez et al. [301] suggested limits between ' r ¼ arcsin Àv r;n =v r À Á and ' r ¼ ' i (equations differ in original publication due to a different angle definition). T a g g e d P Tabakoff [519] studied the rebound characteristics of fly ash particles of 15 mm size on different metal surfaces and varying impact angles. Studied surface materials were stainless steel, aluminum, titanium and some others. Furthermore, equations predicting T a g g e d P erosion behavior at high temperatures were presented. Findings of Tabakoff are presented in Figs. 81(a) and (b). Fig. 81(a) shows the velocity ratio of incoming and rebounding particles. With decreasing impact angle, the ratio approaches unity. The trend of mean measured points is well captured by Eq. ( 126), however with an offset. In addition, statistical distributions are shown within the figure for each measured point. Values are typically found within 20% showing a Gaussian distribution. Fig. 81(b) illustrates the so-called particle directional coefficient, which is obtained by dividing the rebound angle with the impact angle. The rebound angle seems to equal the impact angle at low impingement angles. However, with increasing impingement angles, the ratio drops to around 0.6 implying a reduced rebound angle compared with the impaction angle. A similar study was performed by Reagle et al. [520] using elevated temperatures (up to 800 °C) and high velocities (up to 102 m/s). The study uses road dust particles impacting stainless steel surfaces simulating the deposition of micro-particles under gas turbine conditions. Results indicate that temperature plays a minor role in energy transfer between particle and impact surface below a critical temperature. At 800 °C, the coefficient of restitution is reduced by an average of 16% compared with ambient temperature experiments. Their decrease is explained by an increase in velocity accompanied T a g g e d P by the temperature rise. At higher temperatures reduced elastic modulus and yield strength are assumed to become relevant. A summary and overview on experiments aiming at particle deposition in gas turbines can be found in the work of Hamed and Tabakoff [502]. Particle velocities are considerably higher compared to power plants and therefore not included in this study. Values range from 65 up to 366 m/s [502]. A recent study dealing with ash and char particle rebound behavior was presented by Troiano et al. [456]. The authors studied particle-wall interaction phenomena for entrained flow gasifier using biomass ash and char particles from wood chips and corn stover. The impaction of particles on inclined hot and cold refractory material was recorded using a high speed camera. The authors found that even at ambient temperature, there are indications for plastic deformation. At high temperatures, there is a drop of the restitution coefficients in particular for low impact velocities. Typical restitution coefficients at room temperature were in the region of e ¼ 0.2D 4 2 8 X XD 4 2 9 X XÀD 4 3 0 X X0.6D 4 3 1 X X.

[301] to use a probability function to calculate a random rebound angle, seems meaningful. However, the limit of these angles should be determined experimentally. P erez et al. [301] suggested limits between ' r ¼ arcsin Àv r;n =v r À Á and ' r ¼ ' i (equations differ in original publication due to a different angle definition). T a g g e d P Tabakoff [519] studied the rebound characteristics of fly ash particles of 15 mm size on different metal surfaces and varying impact angles. Studied surface materials were stainless steel, aluminum, titanium and some others. Furthermore, equations predicting T a g g e d P erosion behavior at high temperatures were presented. Findings of Tabakoff are presented in Figs. 81(a) and (b). Fig. 81(a) shows the velocity ratio of incoming and rebounding particles. With decreasing impact angle, the ratio approaches unity. The trend of mean measured points is well captured by Eq. ( 126), however with an offset. In addition, statistical distributions are shown within the figure for each measured point. Values are typically found within 20% showing a Gaussian distribution. Fig. 81(b) illustrates the so-called particle directional coefficient, which is obtained by dividing the rebound angle with the impact angle. The rebound angle seems to equal the impact angle at low impingement angles. However, with increasing impingement angles, the ratio drops to around 0.6 implying a reduced rebound angle compared with the impaction angle. A similar study was performed by Reagle et al. [520] using elevated temperatures (up to 800 °C) and high velocities (up to 102 m/s). The study uses road dust particles impacting stainless steel surfaces simulating the deposition of micro-particles under gas turbine conditions. Results indicate that temperature plays a minor role in energy transfer between particle and impact surface below a critical temperature. At 800 °C, the coefficient of restitution is reduced by an average of 16% compared with ambient temperature experiments. Their decrease is explained by an increase in velocity accompanied T a g g e d P by the temperature rise. At higher temperatures reduced elastic modulus and yield strength are assumed to become relevant. A summary and overview on experiments aiming at particle deposition in gas turbines can be found in the work of Hamed and Tabakoff [502]. Particle velocities are considerably higher compared to power plants and therefore not included in this study. Values range from 65 up to 366 m/s [502]. A recent study dealing with ash and char particle rebound behavior was presented by Troiano et al. [456]. The authors studied particle-wall interaction phenomena for entrained flow gasifier using biomass ash and char particles from wood chips and corn stover. The impaction of particles on inclined hot and cold refractory material was recorded using a high speed camera. The authors found that even at ambient temperature, there are indications for plastic deformation. At high temperatures, there is a drop of the restitution coefficients in particular for low impact velocities. Typical restitution coefficients at room temperature were in the region of e ¼ 0.2D 4 2 8 X XD 4 2 9 X XÀD 4 3 0 X X0.6D 4 3 1 X X. At 1400 °C, values dropped to e ¼ 0.05D 4 3 2 X XD 4 3 3 X XÀD 4 3 4 X X0.4D 4 3 5 X X.</p>

        <p>T a g g e d P Fig. 83(a) shows a recorded image illustrating the impaction of a particle and the ejection of bed particles from a powdery surface. These images are used for the determination of rebound angles and velocity ratios. The measurements on the absolute rebound angle as a function of normal velocity ratio are shown in Fig. 83(b). The maximum rebound velocity ratio and thus the normal restitution coefficient is around e n ¼ 0:58. Most values are in the region 0.1 e n 0.3, indicating a high damping of a powdery glass layer. The absolute rebound angle shows a broad scattering with most particles rebounding at an angle of ' r % 40°. A rebound in the negative tangential direction (left side) was nearly as common as a rebound to the positive tangential direction (right side). Therefore, when a particle impacts a rough surface a random distribution around c r % 50°to c r % À50 B is observed. Van Beek et al. [268] used the two-body collision model described by Eqs. ( 127)À(130) together with Eq. ( 133) with C m ¼ 3:5 in order to predict rebound angles. Relatively good agreement with experiments is reported for the rebound angle and its distribution as well as the rebound velocity ratio. Thus, this kind of model can be applied. T a g g e d P It can be summarized that the normal coefficient of restitution and the friction coefficient are highly dependent on material properties of both collision partners -Young's modulus, yield stress -and process parameters -impaction velocity, impaction angle, particle sizes and surface roughness [268].

[268] and studied the interaction and ejection of particles from a bed upon incoming particles. The two-body collision model was replaced by the so-called discrete element method (DEM), in which every particle contact including rearrangements in the bed, is described. Konstandopoulos [434] reports that the two-body collision model (with a higher effective mass for the target particle according to Eq. ( 133)) fails at higher kinetic energies of impacting particles, when they induce rearrangements or erosion of pre-deposited particles [434,524]. The DEM, developed by Cundall and Strack [525], treats every particle as a discrete entity, which interacts at its interface when in contact with other particles [524]. This method is T a g g e d P often extended for plastic deformation upon contact using e.g. the model of Thornton and Ning [290] or the one proposed by Rogers and Reed [418].

        <p>T a g g e d P An early study using DEM simulations in order to predict deposit growth for uniform particles was presented by Konstandopoulos [434]. Simulations were carried out in a three-dimensional domain using the FORTRAN code "
            <rs type="software">FROZEN</rs>". The calculation is performed until a total number of 10 5 particles are on 63x63 particle radii substrate with periodic boundaries [434]. The following parameters were chosen for the simulation: e ¼ 0:9; f ¼ 0:2; E v ¼ 0; 0:01; 0:1; and n ¼ 0:33 [434,527], where E v is a dimensionless number relating kinetic energy to rotational energy. It relates the rotational energy barrier to the normal adhesion barrier [434]. Simulations are carried out using dimensionless parameters, where the velocity is normalized using the kinetic energy and particle mass. Model results are shown as two-dimensional cross-sections in Fig. 86 for different dimensionless impact velocities and impact angles. The author reports many commonD 4 4 9 X X features compared with real particulate deposit pictures in literature. At low impact velocities, a "roughening" is observed which increases with decreasing impact angle. Orientated voids are caused by regions, where particle deposition is prevented and rebound will occur. These voids decrease with increasing particle velocity. At high impact velocities, the effect of impact angle diminishes and denser deposits are obtained. This is also reported by other studies such as the work of Ots [528]. Another finding shows that with increasing deposition velocity the number of rebounding particles increases. This is supported by experiments of Tsai and Cheng [529] using high loadings and an uncoated flat impaction surface. Furthermore, the number of impactions that a particle requires until it rests/sticks increases with increasing impact velocity. The results show that rebound velocity shows a multimodal nature and particles take up spin after collision. DEM simulations can be a useful, but computationally expensive, tool for the prediction of deposit structure, in particular at low temperatures such as the economizer region. At higher temperatures, sintering and melting occur leading to changes in structures and deposit growth. With this method, effects such as shedding and erosion can be predicted.

        <p>T a g g e d P Studies of particles impacting a solid substrate overlaid with a liquid layer are rare. These collision can be relevant for a variety of industries such as filtration or ash particle impaction on a slagged wall. Barnocky and Davis [530] conducted a series of experiments in which a solid ball drops on a quartz disk overlaid with a thin layer of Newtonian oil. Ball size and thus kinetic energy was varied from 1.6 to 6.4 mm, and material was either steel or polymer (lucite). Studied parameters comprise of the fluid layer thickness and viscosity, the ball size, density and elasticity. In their experiments, Barnocky and Davis [530] determined the critical drop height, and thus the critical velocity, that allowed the ball to rebound out of the fluid layer. The critical velocity, below which particles will stick, can be approximated by neglecting the air resistance v p;crit ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 2 ¢ g ¢ h crit p . According to the authors, this equation is valid within 5% accuracy for their experiments [530]. Results of their study can be seen in Figs. 87(a) and (b). In general, an increased critical drop height (height of falling, above which rebound begins) is observed with increasing fluid layer thickness. The particle is able to penetrate the fluid layer deeper and thus dissipation of the initial kinetic energy is increased. In the case of rebound, particles must deform elastically and thus be in close contact with the underlying solid surface. Fig. 87(a) shows the effect T a g g e d P of fluid viscosity on the rebound behavior of 3.2 mm steel balls. With increasing fluid viscosity, the drop height increases since a fluid with higher viscosity is able to dissipate more of the particle's kinetic energy. This energy misses for particle deformation and rebound. Fig. 87(b) illustrates the effect of surface roughness on the rebound behavior. Here, 75 mm glass beads (particles) were fixed to the landing surface using epoxy resin. The density was 17 beads/mm 2 [530]. The beads were half imbedded in the epoxy yielding a surface with 38 mm hemispherical bumps with a mean center to center distance of 150 mm. These bumps with a radius of x b ¼ 38 mm are overlaid with a film of viscous fluid. When comparing experimental results with a smooth surface, approximately one order of magnitude thicker fluid film is needed for the same critical height leading to particle rebound. Thus, the liquid film can be considerably thicker and the particle will still stick. A ball of the size 1.6 mm dropped from 0.6 m, rebounds at a film of approximately 60 mm for a smooth substrate compared to around 220 mm, for a rough surface.

        <p>T a g g e d P In order to eliminate the influence of particle to particle variation in chemistry and size, soda-lime glass particles within a narrow size range are used. These particles have been applied in previous studies [1,201,222] and exhibit similar properties as ash particles. Glass particle deposition tests are conducted using an entrained flow reactor (EFR) for three size-graded particle classes (40À70, 150À210 and 500 mm) and three wall temperatures (800, 900 and 1000 °C). A detailed description of the test rig can be found elsewhere [185,188]. Tests are conducted for a short period, t exp % 10 min, in order to eliminate sintering and erosion effects and reduce the influence of the deposit on capture efficiency. Experimental conditions and results are given in Table 23. Deposited mass is determined by weight difference. A previously described optical system is D 4 6 5 X Xused to determine layer thickness and growth dynamics [188,312]. Deposition rates _ m dep ; given in Table 23, show that at 800 °C only the smallest particle size leads to deposit formation. A minor amount is found for the intermediate particle size and no deposition occurs for large particles. The main reason for this is the lower temperature of large particles when impacting on the deposition probe. Residence times are too short and heating rates too low for larger particles to reach the wall temperature. At 900 °C, deposit formation is also observed for the intermediate particle size, 150À210 mm, whereas the largest T a g g e d P particles still rebound. Increasing the EFR wall temperature to 1000 °C revealed similar results with increased deposition rates.

        <p>T a g g e d P Experimental results are used, and recalculated with a CFD model. The model predicts the flow field, temperatures as well as glass particle trajectories. The computational grid has a total number of 1.56 million nodes. Special attention is paid to an adequate resolution of the deposition probe, following suggestions established in the work of Weber et al. [206]. Two nodes are placed within the displacement thickness in radial direction in order to resolve the boundary layer and predict accurate particle tracks as well as impaction rates. A total number of 96 nodes around the circumference of the probe revealed independent deposition rates. The number is lower compared to the recommendation of Weber et al. [206], who suggested 384 nodes around the circumference. This could lead to an over prediction of the impaction efficiency at small Stokes numbers St &lt; 1. However, since glass particles in the present work are relatively large, with smallest sizes in the range of 24.3 mm as given in Table 24, deposition rates are not over predicted and numerical accuracy is given. This grid revealed identical deposition rates compared to a mesh with four million nodes. More details on the computational mesh, the model selection and sensitivity studies can be found elsewhere [185,188]. In the CFD model, glass particles are injected as inert material, with a narrow-sized RosinÀRammler distribution, fitted to measurements. Particle temperature is calculated using heat balance [534]. Particles close to the reactor wall almost reached the wall temperature, whereas particles in the center stayed below this value. Temperature-dependent properties of soda-lime glass are implemented in the CFD code, based on a literature review. Thermophysical properties of glass particles are calculated at each position T a g g e d P using the local particle temperature, and thus consider a temperature change within the boundary layer of the probe. Hence, adhesion properties are calculated using local temperatures and not bulk values, which is a crucial aspect, in particular for small particles d p &lt; 10 À 20 mm, which cool down in the vicinity of a cold tube. Properties, PSD and glass composition are summarized in Appendix B. In addition, properties for the deposition probe, composed of Al 2 O 3 , are given. The only required quantity that is not found in the literature is a temperature-dependent contact angle of soda-lime glass on a ceramic substrate. In order to obtain values, the ash melting microscope EM 201 of the company "Hesse Instruments" is used [532]. A soda-lime glass sphere with a diameter of 1.5 mm is placed on a ceramic plate composed of the same material as the deposition probe. Three different heating rates are tested to ensure independent results. Fig. 88 shows shadow images recorded at different temperatures. The contact angle Q c is determined graphically from these images using the software ImageJ. The results are fitted with Eq. ( 54). The coefficients are determined as A ¼ 0; B ¼ 180; C ¼ 930 and D ¼ 100. The results are illustrated in the left part of Fig. 88. Deviations at lower temperatures are due to an insufficient resolution of the camera. The image at ambient temperature does not change up to 700 °C. Only values above that temperature can be determined properly, caused by a shade of the ceramic plate. The plate shadow makes it difficult to determine small changes in the contact angle at low temperatures. Nevertheless, values above Q ¼ 100 B can be calculated using Eq. ( 54). Once all required properties of soda-lime glass are known, sticking criteria can be investigated. A total of eight sticking criteria are implemented in the code and CFD results are compared with measurements. The sticking criteria are: 73), [1,222]. ) and C5 (Walsh et al. [395]). The model of Zhou et al. [391] uses the melt fractionD 4 7 1 X X in order to calculate the sticking behavior. In the present case, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations using the software FactSage are applied to obtain the melt fraction as a function of temperature. However, it is questionable if it is meaningful to calculate the melt fraction for amorphous material, where there is no crystal formation. Nevertheless, this criterion is tested for completeness. Further details on FactSage can be found in the publication of Wieland et al. [312]. The model of Walsh [395] 23. The best correlation coefficient and RMSE are obtained for the model of Srinivasachar et al. [1] (C3) using Eq. ( 73), where critical viscosity is dependent on particle kinetic energy and thus its size, density and velocity. A parity plot comparing experiments and simulations is shown in Fig. 89(b). It can be seen that all three sticking criteria underpredict deposition rates, with the best agreement for Srinivasachar et al. [1] (C3). The higher deposition rates in the experiments are probably due to the stickiness of the deposit during build-up. The highest deposition rates are calculated for C4 and C5 as shown in Table 23. Both use a viscosity value at which sticking begins. They might yield better results by changing the critical or reference viscosity. However, Scholz [459] tested the sensitivity towards this threshold and results only improved slightly. Criteria based on energy or momentum conservation (C6, C7 or C8) yield acceptable results, when comparing the RMSE and correlation coefficient in Table 23. Here, the main difficulty is to find appropriate material properties, such as the Young's modulus as a function of T a g g e d P temperature and for different ash particle chemistry. Relatively good results are achieved with criteria based on the melt fraction. A solution could be the coupling of thermodynamic equilibrium calculations with CFD. By far the best agreement is achieved by using criterion C3, which is simple, reliable and only requires one chemistry-dependent parameter: particle viscosity.T a g g e d P Experimental results are used, and recalculated with a CFD model.

( 152) and ( 148), including equations for p and q of the cubic expression given by Eq. ( 148) [532]. The goal is to find the critical viscosity as a function of particle kinetic energy. Therefore, the particle kinetic energy is varied using a different particle velocities, whereas the particle diameter is kept constant at d p ¼ 50 mm. The same particle size was used in experiments shown in Fig. 91. T a g g e d P A comparison of the above-mentioned model, and equations originally proposed by Mao et al. [390] with glass particle measurements is presented in Fig. 91(a). It can be seen that the present model fits considerably better than the original equations of Mao et al. [390]. The difference between both approaches is the particle shape at stage 4 -given by Eq. ( 150). Equations of Mao et al. [390] under predict the critical viscosity by four to five orders of magnitude. Hence, resulting deposition rates are also expected to be under predicted. This is confirmed by simulations in Table 23 [390]. Some uncertainty concerning the grid resolution exists in this study. Weber et al. [206] found in a later study, that a relatively fine grid is needed for predicting accurate particle impaction rates. Nevertheless, it is concluded that this model might be suitable for larger particles and fails in the case of small ash particles [532]. T a g g e d P An explanation, why the model of Mao et al. [390] works for larger particles, can be seen in Fig. 91(a). The critical viscosity increases at a particle kinetic energy of E p;kin ¼ 10 À9 J, which implies that high inertia particles are sticky even at lower temperatures. It can be explained by an increased particle deformation, and thus, less remaining energy for rebound. This behavior is more pronounced for particles impacting at high velocities or for large particles. However, experimental evidence is still due, and should be studied in future work. The presented equations can explain why particles with low T a g g e d P kinetic energy exhibit a higher sticking probability, as found in the glass particles tests of Srinivasachar et al. [1].

It can be seen that viscosity is strongly reduced, when the angle deviates slightly from ' ¼ 90 B . Fig. 93(a) shows a calculated sticking regime map for different angles of impaction.

The corresponding threshold temperatures are 606 °C for normal and 816 °C for non-normal (75°) impact. Thus, a decrease in impaction angle reduces the sticking probability at a given temperature.

Furthermore, they are obtained for a clean and solid substrate. However, clean heat exchanger surfaces can only be found during the commissioning of a power station. Therefore, there is a need to consider an existing deposit layer and its stickiness. Typically, deposits are classified into three categories: particulate, sintered or molten [266]. The impaction of solidified fly ash particles on a particulate deposit is highly complex, as shown and discussed in Section 5.3. These solid and maybe sharp particles can lead to erosion, shedding, or they can be captured in the porous structure. In case of a molten deposit layer, e.g. on a wall of a slagging gasifier, the problem simplifies [532]. If either the particle or the surface is sticky, the particle will adhere:[390].

        <p>T a g g e d P Modeling ash formation, deposition and predicting the deposit chemistry, require simple and reliable models in particular when coupled with CFD in order to predict slagging and fouling propensities. There are excellent individual/standalone models available for predicting ash formation, rebound behavior or fuel conversion, however, if all models are combined and one model is inaccurate, others might suffer and the overall accuracy is not satisfying. The particle transport and the sticking criterion play a crucial role since they lead to selective deposition, where the sticking propensity mainly depends on the particle chemistry, size, velocity and temperature. Future studies predicting slagging and fouling should avoid using bulk ash chemistry. Instead detailed information on individual particle chemistry, e.g. provided by CCSEM, should be used instead. Otherwise, the prediction of the deposit chemistry, which is known to differ from the bulk ash, is not possible. Often, it is shown that ash deposits are enriched in iron [186] and/or alkali metals [535], depending on the fuel and location inside the boiler. Studies on co-combustion of wood and coal have shown that the deposit chemistry on the cylinder front face is similar to the fly ash fraction at around 2.5 mm, and the leeside deposit is similar to the sub-micron fraction at around 150 nm [66]. Hence, T a g g e d P models using bulk ash cannot predict ash deposit chemistry properly. A modeling approach should include solid fuel combustion, ash formation including the release of inorganics and aerosol formation, ash particle transport, ash deposition and deposit buildup. In order to describe the first three steps a number of fuel properties have to be measured or determined in advance. Fig. 97 shows the most important properties. They can be divided into fuel composition and fuel reaction kinetics. Fuel composition uses standard fuel characterization methods (ultimate, proximate and heating value analysis), particle size distribution, mineral analysis using CCSEM, as well as chemical fractionation. The first two are essential. CCSEM analysis are needed for individual particle inorganic chemistry, enabling the prediction of ash formation and deposit chemistry. X-ray powder diffraction analysis might also be a good alternative, in particular for biomass. For coal, the maceral-mineral association is important in order to model the distribution and number of mineral inclusions/grains per fuel particle. Chemical fractionation becomes more important for lower-grade fuels such as lignite or biomass with a high share of organically-bound inorganics. Components leachable in water and ammonium acetate are assumed to vaporize during devolatilization and char combustion, and thus, be responsible for chemical reactions and aerosol formation. T a g g e d P Reaction parameters include the kinetic parameters for devolatilization, and char combustion. The determination of these parameters requires high experimental efforts, and, carefully conducted experiments. Often, kinetic data is taken from literature using similar fuels. However, this can lead to high uncertainties. If fuel conversion and flame properties are of interest, the kinetic parameters have to be T a g g e d P measured. With all fuel properties and kinetics being available, simulations on ash formation and deposition can be conducted. The ash formation model should be able to predict the vaporization of inorganic elements and the re-condensation of these inorganic vapors. Furthermore, coalescence, char and mineral fragmentation as well as shedding should be included -a challenging and difficult task. Here, a promising approach are percolation models such as the work of Kang et al. [477,478]. Devolatilization and char combustion are known to influence ash formation. Once ash formation can be predicted accurately in terms of chemistry and size distribution, ash deposition mechanisms are required. The most important ones are inertial impaction, thermophoresis and diffusion of aerosols. Eddy impaction can only be predicted when using unsteady simulations, ideally resolving small turbulent scales in space and time. T a g g e d P The ash particle sticking and rebound behavior can be described by a large number of models with varying level of detail. The following suggestions are based on the review in this work. Four different scenarios are discussed and recommendations are given: T a g g e d P Salt-rich ashes: typical for straw and herbaceous biomass T a g g e d P Recommendation: Melt fraction as proposed by Isaak et al. [388,389] using Eq. ( 70). The melt fraction should be calculated as a function of temperature, ash particle chemistry, and gas composition surrounding the particle. Again, bulk ash should be avoided and particle to particle variation in chemistry should be considered. For the calculation of the melt fraction, commercially available tools can be used.T a g g e d P Modeling ash formation, deposition and predicting the deposit chemistry, require simple and reliable models in particular when coupled with CFD in order to predict slagging and fouling propensities.

Here, a promising approach are percolation models such as the work of Kang et al. [477,478]. Devolatilization and char combustion are known to influence ash formation. Once ash formation can be predicted accurately in terms of chemistry and size distribution, ash deposition mechanisms are required. The most important ones are inertial impaction, thermophoresis and diffusion of aerosols. Eddy impaction can only be predicted when using unsteady simulations, ideally resolving small turbulent scales in space and time. T a g g e d P The ash particle sticking and rebound behavior can be described by a large number of models with varying level of detail. The following suggestions are based on the review in this work. Four different scenarios are discussed and recommendations are given: T a g g e d P Salt-rich ashes: typical for straw and herbaceous biomass T a g g e d P Recommendation: Melt fraction as proposed by Isaak et al. [388,389] using Eq. ( 70). The melt fraction should be calculated as a function of temperature, ash particle chemistry, and gas composition surrounding the particle. Again, bulk ash should be avoided and particle to particle variation in chemistry should be considered. For the calculation of the melt fraction, commercially available tools can be used.</p>

A similar situation is found for ashes rich in P (found in manures) or S (for instance in lignites). In general, an energy conservation approach calculating a critical parameter is recommend.

Particle sticking or rebound behavior is predicted for different impact angles, an impact velocity of 2.5 m/s and a particle size of 20 mm at 800 and 1200 °C, respectively. It can be seen that a 800 °C particle only sticks at normal impact, whereas at 1200 °C particles stick at impact angles down to ' i ¼ 60 B . The normal and tangential restitution coefficient increase with decreasing impact angle leading to a decrease in the rebound angle. The rebound velocity on the contrary increases with decreasing impact angle. Since both Eqs.

        <p>T a g g e d P The present work aims for a deeper understanding of ash deposition in particular the ash particle sticking and rebound behavior. The whole process of ash formation and ash deposition is discussed critically, and main findings and mechanisms are presented for a broad spectrum of solid fuels including coals, woody and herbaceous biomass. T a g g e d P Ash formation is a highly complex process, which can only be predicted when distribution, form and association of inorganic species in the fuel is known. Inorganics can be found as organicallybound inorganic elements, as dissolved salts, as mineral inclusions in the fuel matrix or as excluded mineral grains separated from the fuel. The chemical composition of individual mineral grains in a fuel sample differs significantly. This variation requires the use of sophisticated methods such as SEM/EDX or CCSEM characterizing the individual particle composition and revealing information on the T a g g e d P amount and chemistry of inorganic species. A substantial number of particles has to be detected in order to obtain independent and statistically meaningful results. It is crucial to use SEM/EDX data instead of bulk ash chemistry when predicting ash formation and ash deposition. Otherwise, wrong conclusions concerning slagging and fouling behavior can be drawn. Often, single particle types with relatively low quantity in the fuel (individual minerals/inclusions or clusters of mineral grains) are causing ash related problems, whereas the majority of fly ash particles is unproblematic and harmless. For instance, when firing bituminous coal, pyrite in reducing conditions can be such a component leading to excessive slagging of heat exchangers. Another example are small, salt-rich particles in straw combustion systems. Therefore, bulk ash composition can be misleading and models should not be based on bulk ash analyses. Ash formation mechanisms are well understood for coal, however in the case of biomass further research is needed. The exact role of fusion, fragmentation and shedding during ash formation is more or less unknown. Relatively well understood is the vaporization and recondensation of inorganic elements for straw and wood combustion.

        <p>T a g g e d P The particle melt fraction is a popular approach for biomass in particular salt-rich particles. It has often been applied to predict the deposition and sticking tendency when firing biomass [202,258,391]. This approach can incorporate the effect of reducing conditions on the melting behavior of ash particles. Furthermore, modern tools can predict meaningful results for the melt fraction over a wide range of chemical compositions. Problems arise when describing the sticking tendency of solidified particles such as sub-T a g g e d P micron particles, which experience rapid cooling in the boundary layer or ash particles in the economizer region. Here, other approaches are required. A further missing effect is the angle of impact. It has been shown that particles impacting under a small angle of impact are very likely to rebound. Thus, a massive molten particle, which slightly touches a superheater tube at 90°, will not stick -it will rebound. T a g g e d P Another quite popular approach is to use the viscosity of an ash particle at contact with a surface. This approach, however, is often applied inaccurately. There are two concepts: the reference viscosity suggested by Walsh et al. [395] and the critical viscosity first proposed as a criterion by Srinivasachar et al. [1,407]. The reference viscosity is the value at which particles start to stick partially. The critical viscosity on the other hand is the value at which the whole particle will stick. The model of Walsh et al. [395] is often used as a theoretical case for bulk ash. An intermediate sticking probability, where only a small portion of the particle will stick might occur for liquids, however for high surface tension ash particles, it is unlikely. Frequently, the reference and critical viscosity are mixed up and bulk ash composition is used. Bulk ash composition will give an inaccurate and misleading deposition rate. Furthermore, the deposit composition will equal the bulk ash composition, which is known to be incorrect. Srinivasachar et al. [1] presented an interesting approach, where the critical viscosity for glass particles was measured to be a function of the particle kinetic energy. With this approach, small particles will still adhere even at lower temperatures. The problem with this approach is that a viscosity model is required. Models have been developed for silicate-rich ashes found in coal and to some extent in straw; however, not for wood ash or waste-based fuel ashes. Furthermore, these models do not consider the angle of impaction. T a g g e d P Energy conservation methods have been applied in two research fields: the impaction of liquid droplets and of solid, elastic spheres. In general, these methods use energy balances in order to calculate whether a particle sticks -kinetic energy of the incoming particle is completely dissipated -or a particle rebounds -particle kinetic energy is not completely dissipated. In the case of liquid droplets, the crucial parameters are the work of deformation (against the particle viscosity) and the adhesion to the substrate (surface tension, the wetted area and contact angle). Here, the theory of Mao et al. [390] proved to be a good approach. In the case of solid particles, a critical velocity is typically measured or predicted. Here it is commonly distinguished between elastic and elastic-plastic impaction processes. In the latter case, the particle is deformed permanently. A frequently used and accurate model is presented by Thornton and Ning [290], which requires Young's modulus and Poisson number of both collision partners. T a g g e d P A review on modeling studies reveals that most studies use the model of Walsh et al. [395] in combination with the bulk ash composition. Here, the latter is seen as problematic. In order to evaluate the accuracy, eight different sticking criteria based on all three methods and variants of these models are implemented in a CFD code and compared with measurements conducted in an entrained flow reactor. The mass deposited on probes is measured using three narrow size grades of soda-lime glass particles at three different temperatures mimicking coal ash particles. The best performance is found for the model of Srinivasachar et al. [1], where the critical viscosity, below which particle will stick, depends on the particle kinetic energy. A mechanistic explanation based on energy conservation and the work of Mao et al. [390] is extended in order to explain the dependence of the critical viscosity on the particle kinetic energy. Furthermore, the model now considers the impact angle and the stickiness of the substrate similar as it is proposed by Walsh et al. [395]. T a g g e d P The particle rebound behavior is summarized for different scenarios: normal impact on a smooth surface including elastic and elastic-plastic deformation, oblique impact on a smooth T a g g e d P surface, impact on a powdery layer, and impact on a liquid layer with an underlying solid substrate. Selected models from literature are discussed and equations are presented. These models are based on impact mechanics and require knowledge of material strength properties. Several experimental studies suggest that there is a distribution of rebound angles caused by the microscopic rough surface area. For small impact angles, rolling and sliding effects can become important depending on the friction coefficient. Interesting are the results of small spheres impacting a powdery layer. At high particle kinetic energy there is an increased chance, that particles are ejected from the bed depending on the connectivity between resting particles. A promising approach is the discrete element method for predicting the deposit formation at low temperatures, e.g. economizer region with solidified particles. T a g g e d P In the end, a holistic modeling approach including solid fuel combustion, ash formation and deposition is presented and recommendations for predicting particle sticking and rebound behavior are given. Currently, different approaches are recommended depending on the physical state of the particles, i.e. molten or solid, and, depending on the fuel ash chemistry. Research needs are identified and summarized in the following two sections.T a g g e d P The particle melt fraction is a popular approach for biomass in particular salt-rich particles. It has often been applied to predict the deposition and sticking tendency when firing biomass [202,258,391]. This approach can incorporate the effect of reducing conditions on the melting behavior of ash particles. Furthermore, modern tools can predict meaningful results for the melt fraction over a wide range of chemical compositions. Problems arise when describing the sticking tendency of solidified particles such as sub-T a g g e d P micron particles, which experience rapid cooling in the boundary layer or ash particles in the economizer region. Here, other approaches are required. A further missing effect is the angle of impact. It has been shown that particles impacting under a small angle of impact are very likely to rebound. Thus, a massive molten particle, which slightly touches a superheater tube at 90°, will not stick -it will rebound. T a g g e d P Another quite popular approach is to use the viscosity of an ash particle at contact with a surface. This approach, however, is often applied inaccurately. There are two concepts: the reference viscosity suggested by Walsh et al. [395] and the critical viscosity first proposed as a criterion by Srinivasachar et al. [1,407]. The reference viscosity is the value at which particles start to stick partially. The critical viscosity on the other hand is the value at which the whole particle will stick. The model of Walsh et al. [395] is often used as a theoretical case for bulk ash. An intermediate sticking probability, where only a small portion of the particle will stick might occur for liquids, however for high surface tension ash particles, it is unlikely. Frequently, the reference and critical viscosity are mixed up and bulk ash composition is used. Bulk ash composition will give an inaccurate and misleading deposition rate. Furthermore, the deposit composition will equal the bulk ash composition, which is known to be incorrect. Srinivasachar et al. [1] presented an interesting approach, where the critical viscosity for glass particles was measured to be a function of the particle kinetic energy. With this approach, small particles will still adhere even at lower temperatures. The problem with this approach is that a viscosity model is required. Models have been developed for silicate-rich ashes found in coal and to some extent in straw; however, not for wood ash or waste-based fuel ashes. Furthermore, these models do not consider the angle of impaction. T a g g e d P Energy conservation methods have been applied in two research fields: the impaction of liquid droplets and of solid, elastic spheres. In general, these methods use energy balances in order to calculate whether a particle sticks -kinetic energy of the incoming particle is completely dissipated -or a particle rebounds -particle kinetic energy is not completely dissipated. In the case of liquid droplets, the crucial parameters are the work of deformation (against the particle viscosity) and the adhesion to the substrate (surface tension, the wetted area and contact angle). Here, the theory of Mao et al. [390] proved to be a good approach. In the case of solid particles, a critical velocity is typically measured or predicted. Here it is commonly distinguished between elastic and elastic-plastic impaction processes. In the latter case, the particle is deformed permanently. A frequently used and accurate model is presented by Thornton and Ning [290], which requires Young's modulus and Poisson number of both collision partners. T a g g e d P A review on modeling studies reveals that most studies use the model of Walsh et al. [395] in combination with the bulk ash composition. Here, the latter is seen as problematic. In order to evaluate the accuracy, eight different sticking criteria based on all three methods and variants of these models are implemented in a CFD code and compared with measurements conducted in an entrained flow reactor. The mass deposited on probes is measured using three narrow size grades of soda-lime glass particles at three different temperatures mimicking coal ash particles. The best performance is found for the model of Srinivasachar et al. [1], where the critical viscosity, below which particle will stick, depends on the particle kinetic energy. A mechanistic explanation based on energy conservation and the work of Mao et al. [390] is extended in order to explain the dependence of the critical viscosity on the particle kinetic energy.

        <p>T a g g e d P Future experimental work should be directed towards a number of issues and research fields. The morphology, association and distribution of inorganic species within biomass fuels should be studied using advanced methods, such as SEM/EDX. Individual particle composition is essential for a relying ash formation model. This data should then be used as a model input. Sophisticated ash formation models, such as the percolation models developed for coal, should be applied for biomass and/or waste-based fuels. Mechanisms forming coarse fly ash particles are still not understood. Since biofuels are rich in volatile species, ash formation should be studied during devolatilization, and results should be compared to final ash composition. This helps in order to understand the interaction of Ca, Si and K species and the formation of coarse fly ash. Another crucial field of research are material properties. Viscosity measurements for typical biomass ashes, rich in Ca and/or salts are needed. Currently, viscosity measurements focus strongly on aluminosilicates. Material properties including Young's modulus, yield strength and Poisson number are more or less unknown for ash particles. These properties should be quantified for different chemical compositions and as a function of temperature focusing on higher temperatures in the range of 300À1000 °C. In order to find a generally valid sticking criteria, fundamental particle impaction studies are required. High speed cameras should record the impaction process. These fundamental studies should be carried out for other materials such as salt particles (pure salts or mixtures of two or more salts), Ca-rich or Fe-rich particles. It is crucial to use uniform particle size and chemistry. The particle sticking threshold should be determined for each size and chemical composition, and be related to particle properties such as viscosity, melt fraction and the particle kinetic energy. Furthermore, the role of cenospheres and non-spherical particles should be studied. A difficult field is the particle sticking behavior of sub-micron particles. Experimental studies are rare and should be carried out. In addition, studies on particles impacting on a powdery layer have to be extended. They are valuable since clean tubes never appear in a power plant. Another controversy parameter is the impact angle. Models and experimental results often disagree here and more fundamental work on the role of impact angle on the sticking tendency is needed, in particular at high temperatures. Most of the above mentioned fields cover fundamental research. Today, the majority of studies found in literature use fuels and/or bulk ash, and try to relate their findings to empirical correlations. However, computational T a g g e d P methods, such as CFD or DEM, require more fundamental data and no empirical equations or indices.T a g g e d P Future experimental work should be directed towards a number of issues and research fields.

        <p>T a g g e d P An urgent need is a more sophisticated ash formation model in CFD codes. This is particular challenging for lower-grade fuels such as biomass or when fuel mixtures are fired, e.g. co-firing of coal and biomass. Here, various chemical reactions and interactions are possible leading to further complexity. The are numerous studies using a constant mineral matter content per fuel particle. Furthermore, it is assumed that mineral matter equals ash content. Therefore, standalone tools should be developed and subsequently be included in the code. There is also a need for a more fundamental viscosity model considering the network former theory. The applicability of viscosity models should be widened for straw ashes (salt-rich and K-aluminosilicates), wood ashes (Ca-rich), and SRF ashes (various compositions). An interesting aspect, is the particle cooling and deceleration within boundary layers. T a g g e d P CFD methods should be used to accurately predict particle behavior in the vicinity of heat exchanging surfaces. Here, the criterion of Weber et al.
