        <p>Membranes based on polymers as the selective layer are used for the energy efficient separation of gas mixtures including those of key relevance to energy and the environment. [1][2][3][4] The development of new polymers with greater gas permeability and selectivity would further enhance the efficiency of membrane gas separations of current industrial interest, 5 including hydrogen recovery during ammonia preparation (H 2 from N 2 ), oxygen or nitrogen enrichment of air (O 2 from N 2 ) 6 and natural gas or biogas upgrading (predominantly CO 2 from CH 4 ). [7][8][9][10] Increasingly, polymer membranes are also being considered as a practical alternative to solvent absorption for large-scale capture of CO 2 from power plant flue gas (predominantly CO 2 from N 2 ). 7,9,[11][12][13][14] For gas separations on such a massive scale, membranes with very high permeance (i.e. flux) are desirable to minimise energy costs for gas compression and to reduce the active surface area of the membrane, thereby, optimising the overall size and manufacture cost of the membrane system. 5,15 However, polymer membrane materials suffer from the well-established trade-off between gas permeability (P x ) and selectivity for one gas over another (P x /P y ), 16,17 so that established ultrapermeable polymers, such as the polyacetylene poly(trimethylsilylpropyne) (PTMSP), 18,19 and recently reported examples 20 are insufficiently selective for use in gas separations.Membranes based on polymers as the selective layer are used for the energy efficient separation of gas mixtures including those of key relevance to energy and the environment.

        <p>The general trade-off between polymer permeability and selectivity was first quantified by Robeson in 1991 when he identified upper bounds in plots of log(P x /P y ), versus log P x for O 2 /N 2 , H 2 /N 2 , He/N 2 , H 2 /CH 4 , He/CH 4 , CO 2 /CH 4 , and He/H 2 gas pairs based on the gas permeability of the best performing polymers at that time. 21 Subsequently, for a newly prepared polymer (or a mixed matrix membrane) 22,23 the position of its gas permeability data relative to the upper bounds on Robeson plots allows for its potential for gas separations to be estimated. Robeson updated all of the upper bounds in 2008 using initial data for two spirobisindane-based Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIM-1 and PIM-7; Table S1, ESI †), 24 whose rigid and contorted macromolecular structures provided exceptionally high permeability with moderate selectivity. 25 In addition, data for these two PIMs were also used to define an upper bound for the CO 2 /N 2 gas pair, which is of key importance to post-combustion carbon capture but had been considered of no practical interest in 1991. 24 Since 2008, many PIMs with enhanced rigidity have demonstrated gas permeability data that lie well above some of the 2008 upper bounds. 26 These highly shape-persistent PIMs were obtained by replacing the relatively flexible spirobisindane structural unit with spirobifluorene 27,28 units or highly rigid bridged bicyclic components such as ethanoanthracene, [29][30][31][32] triptycene, 33-36 methanopentacene 37 and Tro ¨gers base. 29,35 Indeed, in 2015 Pinnau et al. 38 proposed that the O 2 /N 2 , H 2 /N 2 and H 2 /CH 4 upper bounds should be updated using permeability data from aged films of highly selective triptycene-based PIMs (e.g. PIM-Trip-TB 35 and TPIM-1 33 ). However, revisions of the upper bound for CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 were not proposed at that time due to the data for these polymers and other high-performing PIMs being close to the existing 2008 CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 upper bounds (Table S1, ESI †).The general trade-off between polymer permeability and selectivity was first quantified by Robeson in 1991 when he identified upper bounds in plots of log(P x /P y ), versus log P x for O 2 /N 2 , H 2 /N 2 , He/N 2 , H 2 /CH 4 , He/CH 4 , CO 2 /CH 4 , and He/H 2 gas pairs based on the gas permeability of the best performing polymers at that time. 21 Subsequently, for a newly prepared polymer (or a mixed matrix membrane) 22,23 the position of its gas permeability data relative to the upper bounds on Robeson plots allows for its potential for gas separations to be estimated.

        <p>Recently, we introduced a new PIM derived from a benzotriptycene monomer, PIM-TMN-Trip, which proved to be as ultrapermeable to gases as PTMSP due to enhanced intrinsic microporosity arising from its 2D chain structure. 39 PIM-TMN-Trip demonstrates higher selectivity than PTMSP due to its greater chain rigidity providing enhanced molecular sieving (i.e. diffusivity selectivity). Furthermore, it was found that the unsubstituted benzotriptycene-based PIM (PIM-BTrip) demonstrates even greater selectivity placing its data above the proposed 2015 O 2 /N 2 , H 2 /N 2 and H 2 /CH 4 upper bounds and even above Robeson's 2008 upperbounds for CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 / CH 4 . 40,41 Here we report on the synthesis and properties of some new members of the benzotriptycene-based PIM series (Fig. 1), all of which demonstrate high permeability and selectivity. In particular, this polymer series demonstrates permeability data for CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 that suggest new positions of the Robeson upper bound for these important gas pairs that are of key interest for separations of relevance to energy and the environment.Recently, we introduced a new PIM derived from a benzotriptycene monomer, PIM-TMN-Trip, which proved to be as ultrapermeable to gases as PTMSP due to enhanced intrinsic microporosity arising from its 2D chain structure. 39 PIM-TMN-Trip demonstrates higher selectivity than PTMSP due to its greater chain rigidity providing enhanced molecular sieving (i.e. diffusivity selectivity).

        <p>In addition, the potential benefit of introducing one or two trifluoromethyl (TFM) solubilising groups onto the benzotriptycene unit was evaluated by the synthesis of PIM-TFM-BTrip and PIM-DTFM-BTrip, respectively. Each polymer was prepared from its tetrahydroxy benzotriptycene monomer (1a-f) using the well-established benzodioxinforming polymerisation reaction devised for PIM synthesis (Fig. 1). 44 Monomers were prepared by adaptation of the classic benzotriptycene synthesis, involving the Diels-Alder reaction between 2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy-9,10-dimethylanthracene and the appropriate 1,4-dihydro-1,4-epoxynaphthalene 39 -with the latter prepared from the Diels-Alder reaction between the appropriate benzyne intermediate and furan. [45][46][47] PIM-TMN-Trip and PIM-HMI-Trip are both soluble in chloroform, facilitating analysis using Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) that confirmed that high molecular mass polymer was achieved for both polymers (Table 1). In contrast, PIM-DM-Btrip, PIM-TFM-BTrip and PIM-DTFM-BTrip proved soluble only in quinoline. The success of this high-boiling aromatic solvent for dissolving these otherwise intractable polymers prompted a re-investigation of the solubility of unsubstituted PIM-BTrip, which we had previously described as insoluble. 39 Pleasingly, this polymer also proved soluble in quinoline. Although quinoline is not an appropriate solvent for GPC analysis, solutions of PIM-DM-BTrip, PIM-TFM-BTrip, PIM-DTFM-BTrip and PIM-BTrip could be used to cast mechanically flexible and robust films, implying that a reasonably high molecular mass had been achieved during the synthesis.

        <p>In their powder form, all benzotriptycene-based PIMs adsorb a large amount of nitrogen (N 2 , 77 K) at low relative pressure. Analysis of the N 2 adsorption isotherms (Fig. S1, ESI †) gives apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas (SA BET ) within the range of 848-1034 m 2 g À1 (Table 1), which are amongst the highest obtained from solution processable polymers. 29,39 The shapes of the N 2 isotherms are similar for all polymers except for PIM-TMN-Trip and PIM-DTFM-BTrip, for which there is larger uptake at higher pressures associated with a large hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption isotherms. This might be related to the TMN and CF 3 substituents protruding out of the 2D plane of the polymer chain and thus interfering with the electrostatic nitrile-nitrile interactions which are likely to dominate polymer cohesion. Adsorption of CO 2 at 273 K (Fig. S2, ESI †) shows similar uptakes for the benzotriptycene-PIMs (2.5-3.3 mmol g À1 ). The uptake for PIM-BTrip is slightly higher at lower pressures, which may be ascribed to a greater concentration of ultramicropores (diameter o 0.7 nm in its pore size distribution (Fig. S3, ESI †)).In their powder form, all benzotriptycene-based PIMs adsorb a large amount of nitrogen (N 2 , 77 K) at low relative pressure.

        <p>Solvent cast films (Fig. S4, ESI †) of the benzotriptycenebased PIMs all demonstrate exceptionally high gas permeability (Table 2). However, the evaluation of gas permeability data for a new polymer requires careful consideration of its film history and thickness as these factors influence greatly the observed values. 32 Generally, the highest reported values of gas permeability for high free volume polymers such as the PTMSP and PIMs were obtained from films freshly treated with methanol (or ethanol), which removes any residual casting solvent but also induces additional free volume. 31,48 The values of gas permeability from freshly methanol treated thick films (135-176 mm) of the benzotriptycene PIMs are some of highest reported for a pure polymer film (e.g., P CO 2 = 21-53 Â 10 3 Barrer) and are comparable to those from ethanol treated ultrapermeable polyacetylenes (e.g., P CO 2 = 28-47 Â 10 3 Barrer). 19,42 For each of the methanol treated films the order of decreasing gas permeability is CO 2 4 H 2 4 O 2 4 He 4 CH 4 4 N 2 with the exception of those from the less permeable and more sizeselective PIM-BTrip for which He permeates faster than O 2 . The ideal selectivities of all of the methanol treated films are significantly higher than those obtained for the ultrapermeable polyacetylenes and fall in the range of those reported for methanol treated films of less permeable PIMs such as PIM-1 (e.g., P O 2 /P N 2 = 2.6-3.6). 48 As noted for all PIMs and highly permeable polymers, 31,32,49-51 the extremely high values of gas permeability measured initially from the freshly methanol treated films are not maintained on ageing. 52 However, the reduction in permeability is accompanied by an increase in ideal selectivity for all gas pairs. In addition, on ageing, He permeability surpasses the value of O 2 for all the polymers, indicating enhanced size selectivity. Comparing data from approximately like-for-like samples (i.e. B120 day aged and 110-180 mm thick films) the order It can be deduced that the bulky TMN and HMI substituents both enhance permeability greatly, with the more rigid HMI substituent providing slightly higher selectivity over TMN. The relatively small -CF 3 substituents of PIM-TFM-BTrip and PIM-DTFM-BTrip also enhance permeability relative to unsubstituted PIM-BTrip. Interestingly, the -CF 3 substituents appear to slow ageing, with 54% of the value for P O 2 of the methanol treated film of PIM-DTFM-BTrip retained after one year, and 56% for PIM-TFM-BTrip, as compared to only 30-36% for films without -CF 3 substituents. Depending on the gas, the standard deviation of the permeability is in the range 4-18% for the freshly MeOH treated PIM-HMI-Trip and PIM-DM-BTrip films, and 3-6% for the aged PIM-BTrip film. These are small compared to the effect of the ageing in this work, and almost negligible when represented on the double-logarithmic Robeson diagrams (Fig. S6, ESI †).Solvent cast films (Fig. S4, ESI †) of the benzotriptycenebased PIMs all demonstrate exceptionally high gas permeability (Table 2).

        <p>A thinner film of PIM-BTrip (64 mm) demonstrates lower initial permeability after methanol treatment, consistent with the well-established trend that thinner films age more rapidly than thicker films. 32,52,53 It is also more size selective than the thicker film of the same polymer with H 2 4 CO 2 4 He 4 O 2 4 CH 4 4 N 2 the order of decreasing gas permeability. Due to the commonly encountered variability of gas permeability from differing film thicknesses and history, data for a new polymer are best compared to those of existing polymers by using Robeson plots (Fig. 2). As noted, the position of the data from a new polymer relative to the Robeson upper bounds provides a useful indicator of its potential performance as gas separation membranes. All data points for the benzotriptycene polymers lie far above the 2008 upper bounds for O 2 /N 2 (Fig. 2a), H 2 /N 2 (Fig. 2b), H 2 /CH 4 , CO 2 /N 2 (Fig. 2c) and CO 2 /CH 4 (Fig. 2d). Data for the B1 year aged films for all of the polymers lie close to the proposed 2015 upper bound for O 2 /N 2 . In particular, aged PIM-BTrip demonstrates exceptional selectivity for a highly permeable polymer so that its data lie well above the proposed Table 2 Thickness (l, mm), ideal gas permeabilities (Px, Barrer) and selectivities of freshly methanol treated and aged films measured at 25 1C and 1 bar of feed pressure 2015 upper bounds for O 2 /N 2 (Fig. 2a), H 2 /N 2 (Fig. 2b), and H 2 /CH 4 . A notable feature of the permeability data from aged samples of the benzotriptycene-PIMs on the O 2 /N 2 and H 2 /N 2 Robeson plots is the near linear correlation at a steeper slope than that of the upper bounds (Fig. S5,ESI †). This reflects the far larger reduction of permeabilities on ageing for gases composed of larger molecules such as N 2 and CH 4 as compared to those composed of the smaller O 2 and H 2 molecules.A thinner film of PIM-BTrip (64 mm) demonstrates lower initial permeability after methanol treatment, consistent with the well-established trend that thinner films age more rapidly than thicker films. 32,52,53 It is also more size selective than the thicker film of the same polymer with H 2 4 CO 2 4 He 4 O 2 4 CH 4 4 N 2 the order of decreasing gas permeability.

This reflects the far larger reduction of permeabilities on ageing for gases composed of larger molecules such as N 2 and CH 4 as compared to those composed of the smaller O 2 and H 2 molecules.</p>
        <p>Gas transport through a polymer is described by the solutiondiffusion model 54 with P x = D x Â S x , where D x is the diffusivity coefficient (Table S2, ESI †) and S x is the solubility coefficient for gas x (Table S3, ESI †). Therefore, the ideal selectivity (P x /P y ) for a polymer comes from a combination of diffusivity selectivity (D x /D y ) and solubility selectivity (S x /S y ). The remarkable positions of the data for the benzotriptycene-PIMs on the H 2 /N 2 , and O 2 /N 2 Robeson plots are due to very high diffusivity selectivity originating from the size-sieving behaviour of the polymers, which differentiates between gas molecules of differing effective diameters (d x ). 40 This is best illustrated by the correlation between d x 2 and the diffusivity coefficient (D x ), 55 which is steepest for PIM-BTrip and less steep for benzotriptycene PIMs that possess a substituent, although the absolute value of the diffusion coefficient is larger (Fig. 3). Ageing decreases the diffusion coefficient for all polymers but steepens the correlation between d x 2 and D x , especially for PIM-BTrip, which is evidence of its further enhanced size selectivity (Fig. S7, ESI †). 40 The extraordinary performance of PIM-BTrip can be attributed to its ultramicroporosity, which facilitates the diffusivity of small Energy &amp; Environmental Science Paper polymers, reported by Park et al., 15,61 ''with exceptional CO 2 /CH 4 separation capabilities'', 24 appeared to form an upper bound above that proposed for solution processable polymers. Such insoluble network polymers as the TR polymers often perform above the 2008 upper bounds defined for solution processable polymers due to their rigidity approaching that of carbon molecular sieves (i.e. polymers carbonised at high temperatures). Remarkably, the CO 2 /CH 4 upper bound defined by the solution processable benzotriptycene-based PIMs lies at the same position as that of Robeson's tentatively proposed TR polymer upper bound with a selectivity 2.5 times higher than that for the 2008 upper bound.Gas transport through a polymer is described by the solutiondiffusion model 54 with P x = D x Â S x , where D x is the diffusivity coefficient (Table S2, ESI †) and S x is the solubility coefficient for gas x (Table S3, ESI †). Therefore, the ideal selectivity (P x /P y ) for a polymer comes from a combination of diffusivity selectivity (D x /D y ) and solubility selectivity (S x /S y ). The remarkable positions of the data for the benzotriptycene-PIMs on the H 2 /N 2 , and O 2 /N 2 Robeson plots are due to very high diffusivity selectivity originating from the size-sieving behaviour of the polymers, which differentiates between gas molecules of differing effective diameters (d x ). 40 This is best illustrated by the correlation between d x 2 and the diffusivity coefficient (D x ), 55 which is steepest for PIM-BTrip and less steep for benzotriptycene PIMs that possess a substituent, although the absolute value of the diffusion coefficient is larger (Fig. 3). Ageing decreases the diffusion coefficient for all polymers but steepens the correlation between d x 2 and D x , especially for PIM-BTrip, which is evidence of its further enhanced size selectivity (Fig. S7, ESI †). 40 The extraordinary performance of PIM-BTrip can be attributed to its ultramicroporosity, which facilitates the diffusivity of small Energy &amp; Environmental Science Paper polymers, reported by Park et al., 15,61 ''with exceptional CO 2 /CH 4 separation capabilities'', 24 appeared to form an upper bound above that proposed for solution processable polymers. Such insoluble network polymers as the TR polymers often perform above the 2008 upper bounds defined for solution processable polymers due to their rigidity approaching that of carbon molecular sieves (i.e. polymers carbonised at high temperatures). Remarkably, the CO 2 /CH 4 upper bound defined by the solution processable benzotriptycene-based PIMs lies at the same position as that of Robeson's tentatively proposed TR polymer upper bound with a selectivity 2.5 times higher than that for the 2008 upper bound.</p>
        <p>The benzotriptycene-based PIMs provide exceptional gas permeability data for most important gas pairs and allow for the redefinition of the CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /N 2 Robeson upper bounds. This is important in order to set aspirational targets for chemists in the design and synthesis of novel polymers. In addition, it will help parametric studies of energy and cost efficiency for carbon capture and natural/bio gas upgrading by providing enhanced but realistic state-of-the-art values for membrane permeability and selectivity. The resulting estimates of energy efficiencies and costs will be more attractive relative to both previous calculations for membrane systems and to competitive CO 2 separation processes. The resulting improved credibility of polymer membranes for these crucial separations will stimulate research activity in this technological area of prime importance to energy and the environment.The benzotriptycene-based PIMs provide exceptional gas permeability data for most important gas pairs and allow for the redefinition of the CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /N 2 Robeson upper bounds.

The extreme rigidity of PIM-BTrip accounts for the very high activation energy for the diffusion of larger gases such as N 2 and CH 4 . 40 The gas transport properties of PIM-BTrip appears similar to those reported for the two triptycene-derived polymers, PIM-Trip-TB 35 and TPIM-1, 33 which were used to define the proposed 2015 upper bounds for O 2 /N 2 , H 2 /N 2 and H 2 /CH 4 . 38 It should be noted that the data from PIM-Trip-TB used to define the 2015 upper bounds were taken from a film that was aged for only 100 days after methanol treatment. 35 [56][57][58][59] which is the lower limit of interest for a first-pass polymer membrane for post-combustion carbon capture (Table S1, ESI †). 12 Although all of the data for the benzotriptycene PIMs are above the 2008 upper bound for CO 2 /N 2 , the data from PIM-BTrip are particularly promising with both thick and thinner aged films providing P CO 2 4 4000 Barrer and P CO 2 /P N 2 4 30. The impressive performance of PIM-BTrip appears to be due to an unusually high D CO 2 /D N 2 of 2.0, whereas that of the substituted members of the series relies on greater S CO 2 /S N 2 resulting from the greater number of CO 2 adsorption sites provided by the larger amount of intrinsic microporosity (Table S3, ESI †). The eleven data points on the Robeson plot from four different polymers that fall into a linear correlation parallel to that of the 2008 upper bound allows us to propose a substantially improved new upper bound for CO 2 /N 2 (Fig. 2c and Tables 2 and3). These data points are distributed over a large P CO 2 range of 4400-52 000 Barrer.gas molecules, together with very high chain rigidity, 16,54 which hinders the activated transport of larger gas molecules by reducing thermal motions that allow gaps to form between voids.

        <p>In addition, the data for all of the benzotriptycene PIMs lie well above the 2008 upper bound for CO 2 /CH 4 at a higher selectivity than those of previously reported polymers. Indeed, only data for the highly rigid ''intermolecularly-locked'' derivative of PIM-1 (PIM-C1) 60 and PIM-SBF-2 43 come close to those of the benzotriptycene PIMs (Table S1, ESI †). This exceptional performance appears due to a combination of both high diffusivity selectivity, with D CO 2 /D CH 4 in the range 5.7-9.5 for aged films, and good solubility selectivity (S CO 2 /S CH 4 4 3). Ten data points from two different polymers allows us to propose a new upper bound for CO 2 /CH 4 parallel to that of 2008 (Fig. 2d and Tables 2 and3). The benzotriptycene PIMs that either define or provide data that are very close to this revised upper bound are either unsubstituted (PIM-BTrip) or possess only small substituents (i.e. PIM-DM-BTrip; PIM-TFM-BTrip and PIM-DTFM-BTrip). In contrast, those possessing larger cyclic solubilising groups (i.e. PIM-TMN-Trip and PIM-HMI-Trip) are slightly less selective.In addition, the data for all of the benzotriptycene PIMs lie well above the 2008 upper bound for CO 2 /CH 4 at a higher selectivity than those of previously reported polymers.
