        <p>Magneto-rheological (MR) materials belong to the category of smart materials, and their rheological and mechanical properties can be changed with respect to an externally applied magnetic field. An MR material can be a fluid, a gel, or a solid-like elastomer [1][2][3]. Depending upon the type of matrix material and magnetic particles, MR fluid [3], ferrofluid [4], ferrogels [5,6], MR foam [3], and MR elastomer [3] can be distinguished. The magnetorheological fluids (MRFs) and magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) are the two main branches of the MR materials. In MR fluids, magnetic particles are suspended in a carrier fluid such as silicone oil, whereas magnetic particles are locked in a place within a polymeric matrix in the case of MREs.Magneto-rheological (MR) materials belong to the category of smart materials, and their rheological and mechanical properties can be changed with respect to an externally applied magnetic field.

        <p>Apart from the MREs and MRFs, MR plastomers (MRPs) are another emerging category of MR materials that exhibit promising properties to develop smart materials and structures and demonstrate higher MR effects than MREs and lower sedimentation than MRFs [8][9][10][11][12]. The first MRP was reported in 2011 [9]. MRPs are known for showing plastic properties at room temperature and higher MR effects than MREs due to highly mobile magnetic particles. However, MRPs possess very low initial moduli and are not suitable materials for applications such as vibration isolators and absorbers. Yet, MRPs are potential candidate materials in the field of flexible, stretchable, and conductive sensors and actuators, for example, on-off switches [12,13].Apart from the MREs and MRFs, MR plastomers (MRPs) are another emerging category of MR materials that exhibit promising properties to develop smart materials and structures and demonstrate higher MR effects than MREs and lower sedimentation than MRFs [8][9][10][11][12].

        <p>Magneto-rheological elastomers (MREs) are multi-functional materials with manifold characteristics, in which the mechanical properties such as stiffness, natural frequency, and damping capacity can dynamically be changed with respect to an external magnetic field. Every now and then the magnetic field responsive elastomeric materials are referred as magneto-active polymers, magneto-active elastomers, magnetosensitive elastomers, and magneto-rheological elastomers [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]. However, in a recent survey based on the publications over the last two decades, Pelteret and Steinmann [14] found that the magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) is the most widely used name to refer to the magnetic-responsive polymers. So, this review also uses the term 'MREs' throughout the article. As demonstrated in Figure 1, over the last twenty years starting from 2002, the interest in MREs' has been increased significantly. The early investigations of MREs were on obtaining small strain properties such as the change of storage modulus and the natural frequency, which have been extensively reported in [7,15,16,19,25]. On the other hand, research focused on MREs as smart materials by studying magnetostrictive behavior can be found in the literature [26]. Shape changing capacity determines the magnetostrictive behavior, Diguel et al [27] demonstrated a maximum stretch of 10% for an MRE. However, such shape-changing behavior is not as popular as property-changing behavior such as a change in modulus/stiffness. Thus, the property-changing behavior of MREs has been extensively investigated in recent years [15,16,28]. The popular property-changing behavior of MREs includes the changes in storage/loss modulus, stiffness, natural frequency, damping capability as well as complex viscosity.Magneto-rheological elastomers (MREs) are multi-functional materials with manifold characteristics, in which the mechanical properties such as stiffness, natural frequency, and damping capacity can dynamically be changed with respect to an external magnetic field.

        <p>The investigation of the mechanical properties of MREs both in the presence and in the absence of a magnetic field is essential to use them in real engineering applications. The common magneto-mechanical characterizations of MREs include static and dynamic uniaxial and biaxial compression, tensile, and shear tests in both off-field and on-field conditions. On the other hand, studies devoted to the fatigue properties of MREs can also be found in the literature [29][30][31]. In addition, the deformation property of MREs exposed to a magnetic field has also been reported [32]. An optical method, known as digital holographic interferometry, can be applied to analyze the morphology transformation of the MREs. It was found that an MRE sample goes under contraction and stretch deformation when it is exposed to the magnetic field [32].The investigation of the mechanical properties of MREs both in the presence and in the absence of a magnetic field is essential to use them in real engineering applications.

        <p>One of the promising ways to enhance the properties of MREs in both off-field (no magnetic field applied) and on-field (magnetic field applied) is the addition of magnetic and non-magnetic additives. Several additives materials such as plasticizers, carbon-based additives, and magnetic nanoparticles have been considered.One of the promising ways to enhance the properties of MREs in both off-field (no magnetic field applied) and on-field (magnetic field applied) is the addition of magnetic and non-magnetic additives.

        <p>Additives help prevent the accumulation of magnetic particles and aid the compatibility of the matrix material with the magnetic particles; thus, additives enhance both off-field and on-field properties. Common additives such as mineral oils, Phthalate esters, and silicone-based natural esters were considered as early as 2003 [33] and are continuously increasing [34][35][36][37][38]. On the other hand, the addition of particulate additives such as carbon black (CB), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was considered starting from 2008.Additives help prevent the accumulation of magnetic particles and aid the compatibility of the matrix material with the magnetic particles; thus, additives enhance both off-field and on-field properties.

        <p>A number of research works devoted to the mathematical and phenomenological modeling of MREs' are extensively available in the literature. Jolly et al [2] in 1996, modeled the MRE behavior for the first time, whereby MREs were also treated similar to MR fluids. The approach is widely known as the particle interaction-based model, which is further investigated by Ivaneyko et al [45][46][47]. Multiscale-based approaches are another class of successful modeling schemes to obtain microscale information in the MRE composites [48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55]. Furthermore, continuum-based models are popular tools to understand magneto-elastic responses [52,[56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66], magneto-viscoelastic phenomena [67-69], and temperature-dependent responses of MREs [70][71][72][73][74][75][76].A number of research works devoted to the mathematical and phenomenological modeling of MREs' are extensively available in the literature.

        <p>These mathematical models are summarized in a recent article by Cantera et al [77]. These modeling approaches offer an in-depth understanding of the MREs' behavior subjected to various loading conditions as well as help to predict the behavior of MREs for long-term use.These mathematical models are summarized in a recent article by Cantera et al [77].

        <p>The most common applications of the MREs include vibration absorbers, vibration isolators, dampers, and shock absorbers for vehicles [15,16,[78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86]. Another type of application of MREs composites is sandwich structures, where an MRE acts as a smart core in the structures such as sandwich beams [87][88][89][90][91][92]. More recently, MREs receive significant attention in other applications such as sensors, for example, MRE-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) magnetometer, magneto-resistor, flexible tactile sensor/display [93][94][95][96], flexible microfluid transport system [97], and peristaltic pump [98] and even as a shape memory polymer [99]. For the advancement on MRE materials and systems, refer to a recent topical review [100]. In all the above-mentioned applications, MREs subject to the different loading conditions such as shear load, compressive load, tensile load or even biaxial loadings in both off and on-field conditions (i.e., absence and presence of a magnetic field). Similarly, the mechanical properties of MREs over time (e.g., fatigue properties) are important features that need to be investigated for the sustainability of the MRE-based devices for longterm applications.The most common applications of the MREs include vibration absorbers, vibration isolators, dampers, and shock absorbers for vehicles [15,16,[78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86].

        <p>MREs offer specific responses categorized as the alteration of elastic and viscous properties in a time domain, for example, the change in storage/loss modulus, stress, strain, and complex viscosity as well as the alteration in electrical resistance and capacitance. Hence, it is noteworthy to investigate the mechanical properties of MREs in detail. Having said that, the existing reviews [15,16,37,77,[100][101][102][103][104] reported on the advancements of the MREs only focus on the modifications of MRE materials, their potential applications, and constitutive modeling. Nonetheless, as can be seen in Figure 1, every year more than 50% of the MRE based research works focus purely on magneto-mechanical characterizations using various experimental techniques. The mechanical properties of MREs play a crucial role in successful applications such as vibration absorbers or isolators. Therefore, it is strongly believed that there is a growing demand to report only mechanical properties and characterization methods for the MREs.

        <p>The main constituents of an MRE composite are given in Figure 2. An MRE material comprises a nonmagnetic polymeric matrix loaded with magnetizable particles of various fractions and additives. Table 1 summarizes some key MRE composites that have been synthesized over the last two decades, in which research works only focusing on the magneto-mechanical characterizations of MREs have been considered. The choice of matrix material highly influences the mechanical properties of MREs such as initial modulus, field-dependent modulus, and MR effect. Several matrix materials have been employed to manufacture MREs, including but not limited to silicone rubbers, vinyl rubbers (VR), polyurethanes (PU), thermosets/thermoplastics elastomers, and natural/synthetic rubbers [3,15,16,37,107,110,149,150].The main constituents of an MRE composite are given in Figure 2.

        <p>However, silicone rubbers are the most widely used materials among other polymers. They have some exotic properties that make them attractive in MRE applications. For instance, silicones are readily available as resin (liquid state), which facilitates a homogenous distribution and easy suspension of the magnetic particles during the synthesis process. Moreover, silicone resins have low viscosities, which help the magnetizable particles to easily move to form chains along the magnetic flux direction for the development of anisotropic MREs. In addition, silicone-based matrix materials are vulcanizable faster at an elevated temperature as well as at room temperature and they are also non-flammable, non-toxic, less dissipative, less temperature-sensitive, and highly deformable [151][152][153].However, silicone rubbers are the most widely used materials among other polymers.

        <p>Silicone rubbers used to develop MREs are either one-part silicones or two part-silicones. Usually, silicone rubbers used in MREs are heat-curable either at room temperature or at an elevated temperature. Sometimes, two-part silicone is an addition-cured platinum-catalyzed system. A few common types of silicone rubber are elevated temperature vulcanizing or also known as high temperature vulcanizing (HTV) [32] Magnetic particles are field-sensitive components of MREs and are mainly responsible for the magnetic field dependent properties (i.e., MR or magnetostrictive effect). Carbonyl iron powders (CIPs) are the most widely used magnetizable particles. CIPs are considered to be one of the best choices in synthesizing MREs because of their high magnetic saturation (&gt;700 mT), low magnetic remnant, softness, and high magnetic permeability [16,33]. Furthermore, magnetic particles such as Cobalt, Nickel, and Nd-Fe-B and even Fe3O4, CoFe2O4, and iron sands have also been considered to develop MREs [42,[155][156][157][158][159]. In MREs, the spherical CIPs with an average size below 10 µm have been widely considered. The primary reason for the use of smaller particles is that the smaller particle size offers a higher effective area of interfacial friction between magnetic particles and the matrix materials. Nonetheless, larger particles reaching up to 100 µm or even higher up to 200 µm have also been considered [160]. Even the use of bimodal iron and magnetite particles have been demonstrated [17].Silicone rubbers used to develop MREs are either one-part silicones or two part-silicones.

        <p>Additives are the additional components of MREs. [39]. The second member of carbon-based additives is carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that gain popularity thanks to their high aspect ratio, high surface to mass ratio, and lightweight. The first use of CNTs was reported by Li et al [40] in 2011. In the same way, the additions of graphite microparticles and graphene nanoparticles have also been used to provide the sensing capability by decreasing the electrical resistance of MREs [161].Additives are the additional components of MREs.

        <p>Magneto-active additives include the nanoparticles based on iron and nickel or cobalt oxides. These nanosized magnetic particles can fill the voids among the micro-sized CIPs and thus offer higher MR effects. In 2009 [162], the use of Fe and Co-based nanowires in MREs was reported for the first time. They demonstrated that the nanowire-based MREs displayed higher modulus compared to MREs with only pure CIPs. Likewise, the use of nano-flakes Fe particles has also been considered to develop MREs: the MR effect (based on the loss factor) was found to be 1.56 times higher when Fe nano-flakes were added up to 6 wt.% [136]. It has also been reported that the MR effect of MREs can also be enhanced by adding rodshaped γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles [44].Magneto-active additives include the nanoparticles based on iron and nickel or cobalt oxides.

        <p>Moreover, surface modifications of CIPs are also one of the emerging areas to improve the properties of MREs [163]. MREs made of the surface-modified CIPs exhibit higher MR effects than those with pristine CIPs [163].Moreover, surface modifications of CIPs are also one of the emerging areas to improve the properties of MREs [163].

        <p>Having said that the CNTs belong to non-magnetic additives, there are a number of works, which have proven that CNTs help in improving the MR effect in addition to the enhancement of zero-field properties of MREs.Having said that the CNTs belong to non-magnetic additives, there are a number of works, which have proven that CNTs help in improving the MR effect in addition to the enhancement of zero-field properties of MREs.</p>
        <p>Therefore, it can also be argued that the CNTs or even other carbon-based materials can be considered as magneto-active additives. For example, Li and Sun [164] reported that the MR nanocomposites exhibited not only higher zero-field stiffness and damping than the conventional MR elastomers, but also a greater magneticfield-induced increase, or absolute MR effect. They used multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs) up to 3.5 wt.%, MREs with MWCNTs exhibited a 30% increase in the stiffness compared to MREs without MWCNTs. A similar type of results has also been reported in Aziz et al [165,166], in which MREs containing the functionalized MWCNTs (COOH-MWCNTs) showed a higher MR effect (13.7% increase) compared to MREs comprising of pristine MWCNTs. In some applications, a high initial stiffness/modulus and damping are demanded but upholding a high relative MR effect is a challenging task and supplementary materials (e.g., a higher CIP content) or efforts (e.g. a higher magnetic field) are required to improve the MR effect. Interestingly, the addition of MWCNTs offers a higher MR effect at a fixed concentration of CIPs. Therefore, it is worthy to consider CNTs as magneto-active additives for MREs and a further investigation is required to understand the physics behind the phenomenon.Therefore, it can also be argued that the CNTs or even other carbon-based materials can be considered as magneto-active additives. For example, Li and Sun [164] reported that the MR nanocomposites exhibited not only higher zero-field stiffness and damping than the conventional MR elastomers, but also a greater magneticfield-induced increase, or absolute MR effect. They used multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs) up to 3.5 wt.%, MREs with MWCNTs exhibited a 30% increase in the stiffness compared to MREs without MWCNTs. A similar type of results has also been reported in Aziz et al [165,166], in which MREs containing the functionalized MWCNTs (COOH-MWCNTs) showed a higher MR effect (13.7% increase) compared to MREs comprising of pristine MWCNTs.

        <p>The manufacture of magnetorheological elastomers is similar to a conventional polymer-based material processing technique. Figure 3 depicts a typical conventional manufacturing technique to develop MREs. The commonly adopted matrix material is the silicone rubber, which is initially a fluid. As a result, an MRE can be manufactured simply by mixing a silicone rubber and magnetic particles sometimes by adding supplementary materials such as carbon black and other additives. The processing of raw materials is usually performed at room temperature and thereafter the mixture is poured into a mold and allowed to cure ranging from several minutes to several hours depending on the polymer curing time.The manufacture of magnetorheological elastomers is similar to a conventional polymer-based material processing technique.

        <p>In the conventional methods, the mixture of magnetic particles and the matrix material is crosslinked or cured or vulcanized in a mold. Therefore, magnetizable particles stay locked within the polymeric network after the mixture is completely vulcanized. The mold defines the dimensions such as the thickness and width of an MRE to be developed. On the other hand, of course, desired samples can be obtained by cutting the molded bulk MRE into the right dimension. Typically, the mixing of the raw materials is performed at room temperature and the crosslinking is achieved at a higher temperature in order to accelerate the curing process. Furthermore, if the matrix material is an RTV (room temperature vulcanization) polymer, the curing can also be performed at room temperature. Sometimes, a magnetic field is applied to configure the CIPs into the direction of the magnetic flux lines. In that case, magnetic particles are aligned and locked in a place, such MR composites are known as the anisotropic MREs. Otherwise, if the mixture is cured in the absence of a magnetic field, isotropic MREs are achieved.

        <p>The shear mode of testing is one of the most popular modes that has been adopted to characterize MRE properties. This fact can also be supported from the applications point of view, as a magneto-responsive composite is subjected to the shear loading in most of the MRE-based devices such as in vibration isolators and absorbers [15,16]. Shear tests can be of two types; single lap shear and double lap shear. Test conditions are also similar to that of compression/tensile testing. However, strain levels and strain rates cannot be as high Table 3 summarizes a set of experimental investigations on MREs under tensile testing protocols. In the literature, experimental results up to 100% strains are available. However, as expected, the MR effect is higher at a low strain. This is due to the fact that during a mechanical stretching, the distances among magnetic particles are increased that results in reduced interactions between them. The maximum relative MR effect of 3000% has been reported by Stepanov et al [ 117 ] , which was mainly observed at a low strain level. Recently, in 2019, Hernández et al [ 181 ] performed tensile tests on isotropic MREs by varying CIP concentrations ranging from 20% to 70 % (by wt.%) and found that when a 52 mT of magnetic flux density is induced on the material samples, the one with 63 wt.% of CIPs shows the maximum MR effect. However, the relative MR effect reported by Hernández et al [ 181 ] is still lower compared to the MR effect reported by Stepanov et al [ 117 ] .
