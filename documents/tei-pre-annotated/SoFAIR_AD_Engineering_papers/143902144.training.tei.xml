        <p>Design and synthesis of effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline environments is critical to reduce energy losses in alkaline water electrolysis. Here we report a hybrid nanomaterial comprising of one-dimensional ultrathin platinum nanowires grown on two-dimensional single-layered nickel hydroxide. Judicious surface chemistry to generate the fully exfoliated nickel hydroxide single layers is explored to be the key for controllable growth of ultrathin platinum nanowires with diameters of about 1.8 nm. Impressively, this hybrid nanomaterial exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline solution, which outperforms currently reported catalysts, and the obviously improved catalytic stability. We believe that this work may lead towards the development of singlelayered metal hydroxide-based hybrid materials for applications in catalysis and energy conversion.Design and synthesis of effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline environments is critical to reduce energy losses in alkaline water electrolysis.

        <p>utstanding energy storage density and perfect environmental friendliness make hydrogen an ideal energy carrier or clean fuel 1,2 . Among different strategies to produce hydrogen, alkaline water electrolysis has been receiving special attention due to its unique advantages including unlimited reactant availability, good manufacturing safety, stable output and high product purity [3][4][5][6][7] . However, the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a basic environment (2H 2 O þ 2e-H 2 þ 2OH À ) causes high overpotential and associated large energy consumption, which greatly hinder practical application of alkaline electrolysis 8 . As a typical example, though platinum (Pt) is generally believed as one of the best electrocatalysts for HER, its catalytic activity is about two orders of magnitude lower in alkaline environment compared with that in acidic electrolyte [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] . A plausible way to enhance the HER activity of Pt in basic media is a combination of Pt with metal hydroxides, that is, electrochemical deposition of ultrathin Ni(OH) 2 nanoclusters on Pt electrode surfaces 8,[19][20][21][22][23] . In this type of hybrid materials, the edges of the Ni(OH) 2 clusters promote dissociation of water and production of hydrogen intermediates, which subsequently adsorb on the nearby Pt surfaces and recombine into molecular hydrogen 8 . These pioneering works hold the promise that the sluggish kinetics of HER might be circumvented if rational fabrication of the hybrid materials could be accomplished and the synergetic interactions between noble metal and metal hydroxide are exploited. However, unlike many reports on successful deposition of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) on 2D graphene oxide (GO) sheets [24][25][26][27] , controllable growth of noble metal NPs on the layered metal hydroxide sheets is rarely realized. The difficulty lies in the fact that, with respect to the GO sheets, much fewer surface functional groups (like carboxylic acid and carbonyl) result in the reduced adsorption of noble metal ions onto the metal hydroxide sheets, making it unfavourable for heterogeneous nucleation and growth of noble metal NPs on the surface of the layered metal hydroxides.utstanding energy storage density and perfect environmental friendliness make hydrogen an ideal energy carrier or clean fuel 1,2 .

        <p>In this work, we report a design strategy in which we grow onedimensional (1D) ultrathin Pt nanowires (NWs) on twodimensional (2D) Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets to construct the high performance catalysts for HER in basic solution. We demonstrate that single-layered Ni(OH) 2 (SL-Ni(OH) 2 ) nanosheets with the suitable surface modification are the key to immobilization and growth of ultrathin Pt NWs (defined as Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 ), and the obtained Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 hybrid materials exhibit unprecedented catalytic activity and stability towards HER in basic solution.

        <p>Growth of ultrathin Pt nanowires on single-layered Ni(OH) 2 . The synthesis procedure of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 is schematically depicted in Fig. 1a. First, well-dispersed SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets in formamide were prepared by exfoliation of layered Ni(OH) 2 intercalated with dodecyl sulfate (DS) ions 33 . The single-layered nature of the exfoliated SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets was confirmed by the corresponding atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement (Supplementary Fig. 1). Subsequently, 300 ml K 2 PtCl 4 (60 mM) and 50 ml KOH (5 M) aqueous solutions were added to 10 ml SL-Ni(OH) 2 formamide dispersion (0.5 mg ml À 1 ), respectively. Finally, the mixture was subjected to solvothermal treatment in a 20-ml Teflon-lined autoclave at 120 °C for 4 h to obtain the Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 hybrids. In this synthesis, formamide acts as both the solvent for dispersing SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets and the reducing agent for generation of Pt NWs 33,45 . Figure 1b,c presents the typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of as-synthesized products. It is evident that the Pt nanostructures are exclusively formed on the surface of SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets, and about 94% Pt nanostructures are 1D ultrathin NWs with the uniform diameters of B1.8 nm and varying lengths of 10 to 50 nm (Supplementary Fig. 2). We also note that both the SL-Ni(OH) 2 substrates and the immobilized ultrathin Pt NWs are very sensitive to the electron beam during TEM analysis, and many breakages are discerned when exposed to the electron beam (Supplementary Fig. 3). High-resolution TEM image indicates that the ultrathin Pt NWs are composed of multiple crystalline segments with the lengths of 5 to 10 nm (black arrows in Fig. 1d). The crystallinity characteristics of Pt NWs are further investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, in which the diffraction peaks can be indexed to (111), ( 200), ( 220) and (311) reflections of face centred cubic (fcc) Pt (JCPDS No. 87-0647), respectively (Fig. 1e). The XRD result also excludes formation of Pt-Ni alloy 46 . The Ni(OH) 2 -Pt contact area in Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 is qualitatively measured by determining the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Pt NWs within Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 and Pt NWs completely exposed after removing SL-Ni(OH) 2 (Supplementary Figs 456and Supplementary Note 1). The contacted part of Pt NWs with SL-Ni(OH) 2 deduced from their ECSA result is B35%, and hence the exposed Pt atoms account for B65%.Growth of ultrathin Pt nanowires on single-layered Ni(OH) 2 .

        <p>In addition to the shape and structure, the composition and chemical state of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 are recognized by energydispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum (Fig. 1f) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2). The EDX analysis clearly distinguishes Pt element from Pt NWs, as well as O and Ni elements from SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets (Fig. 1f). Interestingly, small amount of S element is also detected in EDX spectrum, revealing the adsorption of DS ions on the surface of SL-Ni(OH) 2 sheets. Deconvolution of Pt 4f XPS doublet (4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 ) gives rise to two pairs of peaks, corresponding to dominant Pt (0) atoms (82.9%, green curves in Fig. 2a) and less amount of surface Pt (II) ions (18.1%, red curves in Fig. 2a), respectively. Another feature coexisted in Pt 4f region is the presence of Ni 3p peaks that are ascribed to Ni (II) species in SL-Ni(OH) 2 (blue curves in Fig. 2a) [47][48][49] . It is also discerned by Ni 2p XPS spectra that there is no significant change in the chemical state of Ni (II) after growing Pt NWs on SL-Ni(OH) 2 surfaces (Fig. 2b). This phenomenon is coincident with both TEM and XRD observations (Fig. 1b,c,e), disclosing that Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets maintain the lamellar structure and do not react with Pt ions to form the alloy after the solvothermal reaction. The total Pt content in Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 is about 38.0 wt.%, which is quantitatively measured with a inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique.In addition to the shape and structure, the composition and chemical state of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 are recognized by energydispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum (Fig. 1f) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2).

        <p>The experimental parameters including the added amount of KOH, reaction temperature and reaction time were investigated in detail for better understanding of formation mechanism of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 hybrid materials. It is found that the reduction rate of Pt precursors by formamide is decreased as the amount of KOH is increased. In the absence of KOH, large amount of Pt NPs is rapidly formed outside the SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets (Supplementary Fig. 7); small amount of adding KOH (5 ml of 5 M KOH solution into 10 ml of 0.5 mg ml À 1 SL-Ni(OH) 2 formamide dispersion) gives rise to production of spherical Pt NPs with average diameter of B3.2 nm on surface of SL-Ni(OH) 2 (Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 ) (Supplementary Fig. 8), whereas the reduction of Pt precursors by formamide is hardly happened even after 12 h in the presence of excessive amount of KOH (that is, 100 ml of 5 M KOH solution was added in 10 ml of 0.5 mg ml À 1 SL-Ni(OH) 2 formamide dispersion). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 9, the reaction temperature and duration also have large impact on the final products. The aggregates of ultrathin Pt NWs are formed when the reaction time is prolonged from 4 to 12 h at 120 °C, while Pt NPs assemblies are produced when the reaction temperature is increased from 120 to 140 °C under 4 h reaction. This result indicates that the progressive decomposition of SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets in the formamide occurs during solvothermal reaction, most likely owing to coordination of N groups of formamide molecules with Ni 2 þ ions of SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets. Altogether, the reaction time and temperature should be restricted to avoid decomposition of SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets, while the added amount of KOH that determines the reduction rate of Pt precursors has to be controlled to benefit the heterogeneous growth of 1D Pt NWs on the surfaces of SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets. The presence of DS-stabilized SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets appears to be another prerequisite for producing the immobilized Pt NWs. As displayed in Fig. 3a, only spherical Pt NPs with diameters ranging from 1.5 to 3 nm are prepared in the absence of SL-Ni(OH) 2 sheets. Furthermore, both DS-intercalated Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets without fully exfoliation (Supplementary Fig. 10) and carbonate (CO 3 2 À )-intercalated Ni(OH) 2 multilayered nanosheets (Supplementary Fig. 11) are prepared as the contrast substrates to compare with SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets. It is evident that as for DS-intercalated Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets without fully exfoliation, Pt NP aggregates are produced and separated from the Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets (Fig. 3b); while larger amount of Pt NPs with the diameters of around 5 nm are grown on the surfaces of CO 3 2 Àintercalated Ni(OH) 2 multilayered nanosheets (Supplementary Fig. 12). On the basis of the above results from the control experiments, we deduce that SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets affect the formation of Pt NWs through the following aspects: Meanwhile, this interaction between amide group and sulfonic groups is also recognized in the XPS spectrum of S 2p region, a peak located at 168.9 eV (ref. 50). After growth of Pt NWs on the surface of SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets, a new peak appears at 399.2 eV that is attributed to the N-Pt bond (green curve in Fig. 3c) 24 . While for S element, the peaks with obviously reduced intensity suggest the replacement of the adsorbed DS ions with Pt NWs (green curve in Fig. 3d). Evidently, the interaction between formamide molecules with DS ions on the surface of SL-Ni(OH) 2 is crucial for generation of ultrathin Pt NWs 27,44 . We also notice that similar phenomenon was found in growth of ultrathin gold nanowires on single-layered graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, in which the absorbed 1-amino-9-octadecene molecules on GO surfaces guided the anisotropic growth of gold nanowires 27 . In our system, as a comparison, CO 3 2 À -intercalated Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets in formamide do not exhibit the corresponding peaks at 401.5 or 168.9 eV (red curves in Fig. 3c,d), suggesting that there is no specific interactions occurring between CO 3 2 À and formamide. As a result, the Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets could not be fully exfoliated by using CO 3 2 À ions, and only Pt NPs are grown on the surfaces of CO 3 2 À -intercalated multilayered Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets (Supplementary Fig. 12). ( 2) When DS-intercalated Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets are exfoliated to single layers, their surface energy will be greatly enhanced, resulting in much stronger adsorption capability towards Pt precursor ions 24 . The increased adsorption ability guarantees heterogeneous nucleation and growth of Pt on the SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets. (3) Compared with multilayered systems, SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets, which possess higher defect tolerance ability, could allow for horizontal growth of anisotropic nanostructures through slight adjustment of their crystal structure 51 . Electrocatalytic performance of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 . The HER electrocatalytic activity of as-synthesized Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 is evaluated using a rotating disc electrode in 1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s À 1 with a rotation rate of 1,600 r.p.m. at room temperature (Fig. 4a,b). As comparison, the electrocatalytic activities of other typical nanocatalysts including commercial Pt catalyst (Johnson Matthey, 20 wt.% Pt on activated carbon, referred to Pt/C), Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (Supplementary Fig. 8) and pure ultrathin Pt NWs were also investigated at the same conditions. Pure ultrathin Pt NWs with average diameter of B2.0 nm (Supplementary Fig. 13) were prepared by using N, N-dimethylmethanamide as both reductant and solvent 44 . Seen from Fig. 4a, it is clear that the HER current density normalized by ECSA of Pt species (for example, À 0.07 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) at Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (2.48 mA cm À 2 ) is much higher than that at Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (1.06 mA cm À 2 ), commercial Pt/C (0.296 mA cm À 2 ) and pure Pt NWs (0.381 mA cm À 2 ). Interestingly enough, the HER activity of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 is almost one order of magnitude higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Even for the Pt/C catalyst modified by electrochemically deposited Ni(OH) 2 (Pt/C@Ni(OH) 2 ), the HER activity (0.692 mA cm À 2 at À 0.07 V versus RHE) is still far below that of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (Supplementary Fig. 14). In addition, HER electrocatalytic activity in less alkaline condition (0.1 M KOH) is investigated (Fig. 4b), and remarkably the HER current density at Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (6.31 mA cm À 2 at À 0.07 V versus RHE) is also much higher than that at Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (1.86 mA cm À 2 ), commercial Pt/C (0.662 mA cm À 2 ) and pure Pt NWs (0.969 mA cm À 2 ). The HER current density normalized by the mass of Pt species is further demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. 15. The mass current density (at À 0.07 V versus RHE) of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 is 0.679 mA mg Pt À 1 in 1 M KOH and 1.59 mA mg Pt À 1 in 0.1 M KOH solution, which is 4.35 and 4.50 times than that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. It is worth mentioning that to our best knowledge, with respect to the important parameters of HER performance (current density at À 0.07 V versus RHE and overpotential at 4 mA cm À 2 ), the Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 hybrids outperform the currently reported electrocatalyst systems (Supplementary Table 1). The reason for the superior HER activity of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 in basic condition should be ascribed to two major factors: (i) combination of Pt with Ni(OH) 2 greatly enhances the HER activity of Pt species (Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 versus commercial Pt/C and pure Pt NWs). In the hybrid systems, Ni(OH) 2 substrates can effectively activate the HO-H bond, which remedy the limited capability of Pt in water dissociation in basic solution for HER 8,23 . (ii) Ultrathin 1D Pt NWs may expose more active sites while maintaining improved electrons transport characteristics, compared with 0D Pt NPs, Pt NPs/Ni(OH) 2 and Pt/C@Ni(OH) 2 (ref. 38). Smaller charge transfer resistance of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further demonstrates this improved electron transport property in 1D Pt NWs (Supplementary Fig. 16 and Supplementary Note 2).The experimental parameters including the added amount of KOH, reaction temperature and reaction time were investigated in detail for better understanding of formation mechanism of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 hybrid materials. It is found that the reduction rate of Pt precursors by formamide is decreased as the amount of KOH is increased. In the absence of KOH, large amount of Pt NPs is rapidly formed outside the SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets (Supplementary Fig. 7); small amount of adding KOH (5 ml of 5 M KOH solution into 10 ml of 0.5 mg ml À 1 SL-Ni(OH) 2 formamide dispersion) gives rise to production of spherical Pt NPs with average diameter of B3.2 nm on surface of SL-Ni(OH) 2 (Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 ) (Supplementary Fig. 8), whereas the reduction of Pt precursors by formamide is hardly happened even after 12 h in the presence of excessive amount of KOH (that is, 100 ml of 5 M KOH solution was added in 10 ml of 0.5 mg ml À 1 SL-Ni(OH) 2 formamide dispersion). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 9, the reaction temperature and duration also have large impact on the final products. The aggregates of ultrathin Pt NWs are formed when the reaction time is prolonged from 4 to 12 h at 120 °C, while Pt NPs assemblies are produced when the reaction temperature is increased from 120 to 140 °C under 4 h reaction. This result indicates that the progressive decomposition of SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets in the formamide occurs during solvothermal reaction, most likely owing to coordination of N groups of formamide molecules with Ni 2 þ ions of SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets. Altogether, the reaction time and temperature should be restricted to avoid decomposition of SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets, while the added amount of KOH that determines the reduction rate of Pt precursors has to be controlled to benefit the heterogeneous growth of 1D Pt NWs on the surfaces of SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets.

In our system, as a comparison, CO 3 2 À -intercalated Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets in formamide do not exhibit the corresponding peaks at 401.5 or 168.9 eV (red curves in Fig. 3c,d), suggesting that there is no specific interactions occurring between CO 3 2 À and formamide. As a result, the Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets could not be fully exfoliated by using CO 3 2 À ions, and only Pt NPs are grown on the surfaces of CO 3 2 À -intercalated multilayered Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets (Supplementary Fig. 12). ( 2) When DS-intercalated Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets are exfoliated to single layers, their surface energy will be greatly enhanced, resulting in much stronger adsorption capability towards Pt precursor ions 24 . The increased adsorption ability guarantees heterogeneous nucleation and growth of Pt on the SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets. (3) Compared with multilayered systems, SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets, which possess higher defect tolerance ability, could allow for horizontal growth of anisotropic nanostructures through slight adjustment of their crystal structure 51 . Electrocatalytic performance of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 . The HER electrocatalytic activity of as-synthesized Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 is evaluated using a rotating disc electrode in 1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s À 1 with a rotation rate of 1,600 r.p.m. at room temperature (Fig. 4a,b). As comparison, the electrocatalytic activities of other typical nanocatalysts including commercial Pt catalyst (Johnson Matthey, 20 wt.% Pt on activated carbon, referred to Pt/C), Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (Supplementary Fig. 8) and pure ultrathin Pt NWs were also investigated at the same conditions. Pure ultrathin Pt NWs with average diameter of B2.0 nm (Supplementary Fig. 13) were prepared by using N, N-dimethylmethanamide as both reductant and solvent 44 . Seen from Fig. 4a, it is clear that the HER current density normalized by ECSA of Pt species (for example, À 0.07 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) at Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (2.48 mA cm À 2 ) is much higher than that at Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (1.06 mA cm À 2 ), commercial Pt/C (0.296 mA cm À 2 ) and pure Pt NWs (0.381 mA cm À 2 ). Interestingly enough, the HER activity of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 is almost one order of magnitude higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Even for the Pt/C catalyst modified by electrochemically deposited Ni(OH) 2 (Pt/C@Ni(OH) 2 ), the HER activity (0.692 mA cm À 2 at À 0.07 V versus RHE) is still far below that of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (Supplementary Fig. 14). In addition, HER electrocatalytic activity in less alkaline condition (0.1 M KOH) is investigated (Fig. 4b), and remarkably the HER current density at Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (6.31 mA cm À 2 at À 0.07 V versus RHE) is also much higher than that at Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 (1.86 mA cm À 2 ), commercial Pt/C (0.662 mA cm À 2 ) and pure Pt NWs (0.969 mA cm À 2 ). The HER current density normalized by the mass of Pt species is further demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. 15. The mass current density (at À 0.07 V versus RHE) of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 is 0.679 mA mg Pt À 1 in 1 M KOH and 1.59 mA mg Pt À 1 in 0.1 M KOH solution, which is 4.35 and 4.50 times than that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. It is worth mentioning that to our best knowledge, with respect to the important parameters of HER performance (current density at À 0.07 V versus RHE and overpotential at 4 mA cm À 2 ), the Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 hybrids outperform the currently reported electrocatalyst systems (Supplementary Table 1). The reason for the superior HER activity of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 in basic condition should be ascribed to two major factors: (i) combination of Pt with Ni(OH) 2 greatly enhances the HER activity of Pt species (Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 versus commercial Pt/C and pure Pt NWs). In the hybrid systems, Ni(OH) 2 substrates can effectively activate the HO-H bond, which remedy the limited capability of Pt in water dissociation in basic solution for HER 8,23 . (ii) Ultrathin 1D Pt NWs may expose more active sites while maintaining improved electrons transport characteristics, compared with 0D Pt NPs, Pt NPs/Ni(OH) 2 and Pt/C@Ni(OH) 2 (ref. 38). Smaller charge transfer resistance of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further demonstrates this improved electron transport property in 1D Pt NWs (Supplementary Fig. 16 and Supplementary Note 2).</p>
        <p>Finally, the stability of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 , Pt NPs/Ni(OH) 2 , pure Pt NWs and commercial Pt/C during HER process is evaluated by using the steady carbon fibre paper (CP) as a working electrode (Supplementary Fig. 17). Impressively, the chronoamperometric study indicates that, under the same conditions, the current density at as-synthesized Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 shows a considerably slower decay than that at Pt/C, pure Pt NWs and Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 both in 1 and 0.1 M KOH (Fig. 4c,d). Through analysing data shown in Fig. 4c,d, several conclusions can be achieved about the stability performance of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 catalysts. First of all, on the SL-Ni(OH) 2 substrates, the ultrathin 1D Pt NWs have higher stability compared with Pt NPs. Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 preserves 95.7 and 98.3% of its initial activity in 1 M and 0.1 M KOH, respectively, after 4,000 s test, while Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 keeps 85.4 and 90.3% of the initial activity. The excellent electrochemical stability of 1D nanostructures have been demonstrated by several previous reports 35,40,52 . It is widely accepted that the asymmetry of 1D ultrathin structure can effectively suppress physical ripening and dissolution during long-term application. Second, the SL-Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets may greatly enhance the HER stability in basic environment. Without the combination of SL-Ni(OH) 2 , pure Pt NWs only maintain 61.6 and 79.0% of its initiate activity in 1 and 0.1 M KOH after 4,000 s test. Third, Pt catalysts in lower concentration of KOH solution possess higher HER stability. Especially for commercial Pt/C and pure Pt NWs, their normalized current remains about 85.1 and 79.0% in 0.1 M KOH after 4,000 s test, which is much 469.9 and 61.6% in 1 M KOH; whereas, for Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 and Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 , the corresponding variation is much smaller compared with commercial Pt/C and pure Pt NWs. These differences further confirm that the SL-Ni(OH) 2 could effectively improve the HER stability of Pt nanostructures in strong basic environment. Moreover, to investigate the long-term HER stability of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 , we carried out 40,000 s test in both 1 and 0.1 M KOH. As displayed in Supplementary Fig. 18, Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 keeps 82.9 and 92.5% of its initial activity in 1 and 0.1 M KOH after 40,000 s test. These data highlight the superior stability of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 with respect to commercial Pt/C and pure Pt NWs. Supplementary Fig. 18c,d presents typical TEM images of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 after 40,000 s test in 1 M KOH. Generally, the Pt NWs maintain their initial 1D ultrathin nanostructures. There also appear some aggregates and shorter Pt NWs, and this morphology change that gives rise to partial loss of initial active centres should be responsible for decrease of the HER activity after long-time electrolysis.Finally, the stability of Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 , Pt NPs/Ni(OH) 2 , pure Pt NWs and commercial Pt/C during HER process is evaluated by using the steady carbon fibre paper (CP) as a working electrode (Supplementary Fig. 17).

        <p>The electrochemical tests were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell (Pine Instruments) using a Pt wire and a Ag/AgCl electrode as a counter and a reference electrode, respectively. Before measurement, a fresh batch of electrolyte with required concentration (0.1 or 1 M) was prepared in a polypropylene bottle by dissolving the required mass of KOH in Milli-Q water.

For our stability tests, CP was cut into 1 Â 1 cm 2 plate, and then 25 ml catalyst ink was dropped on it and completely dried at room temperature. The stability of commercial Pt/C, pure Pt NWs, Pt NPs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 and Pt NWs/SL-Ni(OH) 2 during HER process was evaluated by a chronoamperometric method both in 1 M KOH solution (applied potential was À 0.077 V versus RHE) and 0.1 M KOH (applied potential was À 0.086 V versus RHE).For stability test, we built an experimental device using CP as a working electrode (shown in Supplementary Fig. 17).
