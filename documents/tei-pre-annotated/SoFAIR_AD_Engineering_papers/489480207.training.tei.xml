        <p>The determination of the optical band gap energy (E g ) is important for optimization of the generation of electron/hole pairs in semiconductor materials under illumination. For this purpose, the classical theory proposed by Kubelka and Munk (K-M) has been largely employed for the study of amorphous and polycrystalline materials. In this paper, the authors demonstrate, step by step, how to use the K-M function and apply it thoroughly to the determination of the E g of TiO 2 semiconductor powder (pressed at different thicknesses) from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements. For the sample thicknesses 1-4 mm, E g values of 3.12-3.14 eV were obtained. With this work it is envisaged a clarification to the procedure of determination of the E g from the K-M theory and DRS data, since some drawbacks, and misconceptions have been identified in the recent literature. In particular, the widely used practice of determining the E g of a material directly from the K-M function is found to be inadequate.The determination of the optical band gap energy (E g ) is important for optimization of the generation of electron/hole pairs in semiconductor materials under illumination.

        <p>Semiconductor materials have received increasing attention in the photocatalysis field because of their ability to degrade various pollutants present in water or air through a sequence of redox reactions [1][2][3][4][5]. The photocatalytic ability of semiconductors is related to the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band caused by the absorption of a photon with an appropriate wavelength. The photoexcited electrons and holes are good reductant and powerful oxidant species, respectively [6][7][8]. In this scenario, the application of semiconductor materials for environmental remediation in large scale will depend, among other factors, on its activation in an effective way by solar radiation. In this sense, the scientific community has investigated different strategies that allow a more efficient absorption of visible light by wide-gap semiconductors, such as TiO 2 [9][10][11][12].Semiconductor materials have received increasing attention in the photocatalysis field because of their ability to degrade various pollutants present in water or air through a sequence of redox reactions [1][2][3][4][5].

        <p>Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) with a UV-visible spectrophotometer is a technique frequently employed to study the optical properties of solids. In this context, the classical Kubelka-Munk (K-M) model has been extensively employed to understand the light scattering from the surface of semiconductor powder materials [13,14]. Initially, Paul Kubelka and Franz Munk proposed a theoretical approach to study how the colour of a substrate is changed after the application of a paint layer with certain composition and thickness [15]. At present, the K-M model is commonly used to analyse DRS results and estimate the optical band gap energy (or simply the band gap) of semiconductor materials [16].Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) with a UV-visible spectrophotometer is a technique frequently employed to study the optical properties of solids.

        <p>Kubelka and Munk suggested that the absorption and scattering are first order phenomena [15]. The system in study consists of a substrate coated with a certain material of interest, which is illuminated with diffuse monochromatic radiation. Moreover, this system must have a disk form (cylindrical geometry) with a flat area A and a thickness L, so boundaries' effect is neglected. The incident light has intensity I and the reflected portion has intensity J, which allows to define a dimensionless quantity, the reflectance: R = J/I. Naturally, R depends on L and the absorption and scattering properties of the medium (Appendix).Kubelka and Munk suggested that the absorption and scattering are first order phenomena [15].

        <p>This section presents the dependence of the absorption (α) and scattering (s) coefficients of a semiconductor (or insulator) material as a function of the incident photon energy (E). In fact, α and s are intrinsic optical properties of the materials and represent the probabilities of light being absorbed and scattered, respectively, per unit path length [32]. The standard assumption is that the absorption occurs essentially in the material while the scattering is due to material's inhomogeneity and, to the first approximation, may be considered as independent of the absorption. The theory of scattering by fluctuations of the dielectric constant in a non-absorbing material has been developed by several authors and, while these theoretical considerations may differ in details, the main result is the following [33].

        <p>For amorphous and polycrystalline materials, the density of states is non-zero inside the gap, with disorder-induced band tails, so the band gap width is not well defined. Band tail states are, in fact, electronic states present just above the valence band or right below the conduction band. In general, these states originate from thermal, structural, impurity and/or compositional disorder [41]. So, for these materials, the common procedure is to use the so-called Tauc plot obtained by extrapolating the dependence Eq. ( 6) to zero (while the real absorption coefficient for those energies is still non-zero because of the band tails) [42]. That is, it is clear from Eq. ( 6) that the E g must be obtained by extrapolating to zero a linear fit to a plot of (F(R) × E) 1/p versus E. In general, the authors take the liberty of using the "Tauc plot" designation in other similar plots that also aim to obtain E g by extrapolation.For amorphous and polycrystalline materials, the density of states is non-zero inside the gap, with disorder-induced band tails, so the band gap width is not well defined.

        <p>The main goal of this section is to emphasize that the determination of E g from the plot F(R) versus E is an inadequate procedure, although recently practiced by several authors [20][21][22][23]. The E g of commercial TiO 2 nanoparticles will be calculated from diffuse reflectance data analysed according to Eqs. ( 1) and ( 6). For this purpose, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were carried out using a Shimadzu 2501 PC spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Barium Sulphate (BaSO 4 ) was used as reference for the reflectance spectra, which means that the value of R in Eq. ( 1) is actually taken to be the R sample /R BaSO4 ratio. TiO 2 nanoparticles, consisting of a mixture of anatase (80%) and rutile (20%) crystalline phases, were inserted into the circular cavity of the sample support and then compressed by a glass rod. To analyse the impact of thickness in obtaining F(R), different samples were compressed with 0.5, 1.0, 1.7, 2.0, 2.5 and 4.0 mm layer thickness.The main goal of this section is to emphasize that the determination of E g from the plot F(R) versus E is an inadequate procedure, although recently practiced by several authors [20][21][22][23].

Physically, this means that an increase in the thickness of the material does not cause a significant change in its reflectance or analogously in the F(R). Technically, it was verified if there are differences between the results of reflectance for the maximum sample thickness allowed by the support (the height of support cavity is equal to 4.0 mm) in comparison with thinner thicknesses (0.5, 1.0, 1.7, 2.0, 2.5 mm).

        <p>Practically, for λ &gt;430 nm all radiation is reflected by TiO 2 (R ≈ 100%), for which reason the powders appears white. On the other hand, for λ &lt; 300 nm the incident photons have the energy sufficient for the electron/hole generation and, therefore, are almost completely absorbed by the material (the reflectance is very low). In fact, the slight differences observed in the spectra are more evident for the whole wavelength range shown in Fig. 1b. It is noted that the curves are very close to each other, except for the one corresponding to the sample of thickness equal to 0.5 mm, suggesting that the sample support reflectance may have affected the spectrum of this sample. Furthermore, it is possible conclude that the wavelength correspondent to the band gap energy, or absorption edge, is most likely located between ∼420 nm or 2.95 eV (beginning of absorption of radiation by sample, which R starts to decrease) and ∼320 nm or 3.88 eV (value from which almost all radiation is absorbed, i.e., R ≈ 0). However, as discussed previously, in the vicinity of the absorption edges (320 and 420 nm), there is an influence of the band tails, which cannot be assessed by DRS measurements. From the data illustrated in Fig. 1,(F(R) × E) 1/2 (Fig. 2a) and F(R) (Fig. 2b) were plotted as a function of the incident photon energy, considering the wavelength range between ∼320 and ∼420 nm.Practically, for λ &gt;430 nm all radiation is reflected by TiO 2 (R ≈ 100%), for which reason the powders appears white.

        <p>As it is well known, anatase-rutile binary systems perform better in photocatalytic processes in terms of efficiency, compared to the case when only one of these isolated components is used [43]. So, there is an extensive range of band gap values presented in the scientific literature for TiO 2 resulting from the combination of rutile and anatase phases. Also, the optical properties, in general, show some variations depending on the experimental conditions used to synthesize the samples, chemical composition and degree of disorder [44]. Howsoever, the band gap values obtained from the linear fits to (F(R) × E) 1/2 versus E are in reasonable agreement with those (3.18 eV) reported by Rodríguez et al. [45], unlike the values presented in the last column of Table 1. Additionally, it is important to note that the E g obtained for 0.5 mm sample (3.05 eV) is slightly lower than the expected value for non-doped TiO 2 nanoparticles consisting of a mixture of anatase (80%) and rutile (20%) crystalline phases (3.19 eV) [46]. In fact, this thickness is not adequate to apply the K-M function (Eq. ( 1)), as explained in Section 2.

        <p>This work is aimed to discuss the K-M model and apply it to the analysis of diffuse reflectance data for a medium in form of powder pressed at different thicknesses. Also, the necessary steps to interpret F(R) and its use for the determination of the band gap are presented and discussed in order to avoid any misunderstanding and inconsistencies. It is shown that, for a sample with a semi-infinite thickness, the F(R) is defined as the ratio between the K-M absorption (K) and scattering (S) coefficients. Since these two coefficients have the same dimensions, the K-M function is dimensionless.This work is aimed to discuss the K-M model and apply it to the analysis of diffuse reflectance data for a medium in form of powder pressed at different thicknesses.

        <p>Tauc plots were performed for pressed TiO 2 nanoparticles with varying layer thickness in order to study the dependence of this property in the experimental determination of the band gap value. It was concluded that a thickness of about 0.5 mm is not sufficient for the use of the F(R) in the investigated samples. Finally, the authors hope that this work can be useful to supress the various inconsistencies verified in recent works about the concepts involved in the application of the K-M model and Tauc plots.Tauc plots were performed for pressed TiO 2 nanoparticles with varying layer thickness in order to study the dependence of this property in the experimental determination of the band gap value.

        <p>Indirect band gap values for TiO 2 powder layers with varying thicknesses calculated from the linear fits to (F(R) × E) 1/2 versus E(Fig. 2a, interval between 3.2 and 3.8 eV) and F(R) versus E(Fig. 2b, interval between 3.3 and 3.8 eV). Kubelka and Munk proposed differential equations for the changes of incident light intensity going downward (i) and going upward (j) at any point x within the film material medium [15]. At this moment, it is pertinent to answer the following question: how to calculate the reflectance for a layer of thickness dx located at a distance x from the substrate, inside the material? For this, it is necessary to quantify the incident and reflected flux within dx (Fig A1 ). It is important to note that dx has different signs in Eqs. A1 and A2. Therefore, when considering the positive x axis oriented upwards, dx is negative in Eq. (A1) and the di term on the left side of this equation must be replaced bydi. To solve these differential equations, it is useful to sum the results Eq. (A1) divided by i (considering the correct signal) and Eq. (A2) divided by j, resulting in the Eq. (A3). Defining K/S + 1 = a (constant for an optically homogeneous medium [36]) and integrating over the entire thickness of the sample, Eq. (A4d) can be written as:Indirect band gap values for TiO 2 powder layers with varying thicknesses calculated from the linear fits to (F(R) × E) 1/2 versus E(Fig. 2a, interval between 3.2 and 3.8 eV) and F(R) versus E(Fig. 2b, interval between 3.3 and 3.8 eV).
