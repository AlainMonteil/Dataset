        <p>The study of lithium (Li)-ion batteries is currently of huge scientific and technological interest in order to reduce fossil energy powered automobiles in the market. Hence, the automobile manufacturers are encouraged to push towards electrification. There are several major barriers for achieving a strong competitor role in the electrification market; maximum range, fast-charging ability, lifetime and safety are the key performance elements whilst a customer decides on purchasing an electric vehicle (EV) [1,2]. These key elements can be profoundly influenced by the battery degradation mechanism, which causes capacity loss and resistance increase over the lifetime [3]. Battery degradation can be a serious problem in the automotive industry affecting the vehicles warranty period and compromise an industry's reputation in the business market role [4]. Hence fundamental understanding of degradation mechanisms is critical for the development of reliable life-prediction methods for battery management systems (BMS).The study of lithium (Li)-ion batteries is currently of huge scientific and technological interest in order to reduce fossil energy powered automobiles in the market.

        <p>Identifying ageing mechanism in a Li-ion battery is the main and most challenging goal, therefore a wide range of experimental and simulation approaches have provided considerable insight into the battery degradation that causes capacity loss [3,[5][6][7]. Post-mortem analysis methods; such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [8], X-ray diffraction (XRD) [9,10], scanning electron microscopy (SEM) [4,11,12], and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) [12] techniques, have yielded refined indications for morphological changes of the electrodes, the electrolyte, the separator, and the current collectors over lifetime period [13]. Although, there is no significant morphological modification reported for the positive electrode [14][15][16], a common theme emerging from these studies is that solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) [7,13,15,17] and deposition of metallic lithium in the anode (lithium-plating) [15,18], causes substantial cell ageing [7,15,17,18]. Similar depositions of at the cathode, termed as cathode electrolyte interphase from electrolyte oxidation, has been reported [19]. However these side reactions can generate gaseous compounds (such as hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride) and is not considered as the primary ageing mechanism in this study.Identifying ageing mechanism in a Li-ion battery is the main and most challenging goal, therefore a wide range of experimental and simulation approaches have provided considerable insight into the battery degradation that causes capacity loss [3,[5][6][7].

        <p>As many studies have already showed that formation of SEI and lithium-plating passive film layers at the anode electrode are formed by consuming of the cyclable Li-ions [7,17] and can extend hundreds of nanometers in thickness [7,20]. This large non-homogeneous morphological passive films growth on active material geometry causes; (i) drastic decrease in electrode porosity and (ii) limits the kinetic transport of lithium-ions through those inactive areas and causes resistance increase and capacity fade [18]. Despite many existing ageing models showing a good comparison against experimental studies, the models consider SEI composed of a homogeneous layer with the assumption of linear solvent diffusion in the SEI with a constant base reaction rate and SEI growth. The layer is treated as a non-porous block with a sharp interphase and the effect of film growth on the anode electrode volume is ignored [17,18,[21][22][23][24][25][26], although the recent experimental studies show that these passive film formation has multi-layered structure of SEI with a dense layer of inorganic components close to graphite electrode followed by a porous organic layer close to electrolyte [7,13,27]. The nanoporous structure of SEI influence Li-ion mass transport and also kinetics as theoretical studies show that diffusion within a porous structure hinders the diffusion coefficient and causes a lack of communication of Li-ion with active material [28]. Since the performance of the battery is highly coupled with the effective diffusion coefficient of Li-ion, quantifying all these ageing features precisely will improve lifetime prediction of cell capacity during cell operation.As many studies have already showed that formation of SEI and lithium-plating passive film layers at the anode electrode are formed by consuming of the cyclable Li-ions [7,17] and can extend hundreds of nanometers in thickness [7,20].

        <p>The objective of this study is to investigate the lifetime of a NCA/ graphite Li-ion cell at a constant-current (CC) and dynamic power profile at 25 • C by deploying a well-known P2D battery model with our novel ageing mechanism of multi-layered heterogeneous SEI growth and lithium-plating and coupling the diffusion coefficients of Li-ion, EC and DMC as a function of local porosity. The experimentally measured capacity fade and terminal voltage of the cell during cycling are compared against the model and captured linear and nonlinear capacity fades at high and low C-rates, respectively.

        <p>Capacity loss and resistance increase are the consequence of cell ageing [17,23]. There are many reasons that causes cell ageing, however, the most prominent features are the side reactions, SEI layers and lithium plating that occurs at the anode electrode [8,18,31]. Here we limited the ageing mechanism with the side reactions Eqs. ( 4), ( 6) and (7) mentioned in previous section. The ageing parameterization serves vitally important to capture the structural (porosity variation) and chemical features that causes capacity loss. The equilibrium potential of the side reactions Eqs. ( 4), ( 6) and ( 7), volume fractions, and ionic conductivity values are taken from Ref. [31]. However, the kinetic rate constant, diffusion coefficient, molar weight, and density for the EC and DMC compounds are fitted to experimental measured cycling (1C discharge, C/3 charging) data at 25 • C that completed 420 cycles reaching EoL. The fitting is performed via the method of least squares and the LM optimization solver for the 420 cycles (see Table 2 for the ageing parameters).Capacity loss and resistance increase are the consequence of cell ageing [17,23].

        <p>The capacity degradation as a function of the cycle number using the optimized parameters is plotted to show the comparison of the fitted model results (black solid-line) against experimental measured data (black square symbols) in Fig. 3. The model results match fairly well with a goodness-of-fit-error (GoF) of 98.76%, indicating that the model is able to predict the internal cell characteristics (structural modification and chemical features) reliably throughout the lifespan of the cell and can simulate nonlinear capacity fade. The nominal capacity drop of 15.96% after 300 cycles in Fig. 3 is attributed to the active material loss and electrolyte consumption loss caused by the side reactions [7,18,21,31]. Moreover, after the 300th cycle the cell lost 32% of capacity in 160 cycles. This sudden capacity loss (nonlinear ageing or knee-point) is due to severe deterioration of ion kinetics and local porosity clogging at the anode/separator interface as depicted in Fig. S2 (b). This clogging likely increases the over potential for lithium-ion transport in the anode electrode and may lead to nonlinear capacity fade and lithium-plating at moderate temperatures and charging steps as explained previously by Ref. [8,15,32].The capacity degradation as a function of the cycle number using the optimized parameters is plotted to show the comparison of the fitted model results (black solid-line) against experimental measured data (black square symbols) in Fig. 3.

        <p>Using the optimized parameters (based on the C/3 charging -1C discharging cycling) the model is used to predict and validate the nominal capacity fade for the 4C discharge and C/3 charging constant current cycling. Fig. 3 shows the nominal capacity fade as a function of cycle number for the 4C discharge and C/3 charging constant current cycling. Interestingly, both the model and the measured data shows almost a linear capacity fade until 600 cycles. The results show that the ageing model can maintain sufficient accuracy in terms of capacity degradation response prediction with a GoF of 98.17%. In comparison to the 1C discharging, 4C discharging shows higher lifetime without showing a transition from linear to nonlinear. As can be seen in Fig. S3 (a), the contribution of the plating is only 5% to total capacity loss, whereas the SEI growth due to the EC reduction hits to around 70% with remarkable amount of DMC reduction, 25%. It worth to note that because of the EC denser structure, the capacity retention is quite large although Li-plating is not observed significantly. This behaviour qualitatively agrees with the results from Ref. [15,16]. Also, the capacity degradation after 200 cycles show linear behaviour, this characteristic is purely due to EC component of SEI growth as depicted in Fig. S2 (a). The yellow region in Fig. 3 is the 80% threshold of the initial capacity, which is typically considered as the EoL for an EV battery. Furthermore, we compared our experimental results against existing ageing models in Ref. [18] using the optimized parameters in Table 2. The discrepancy of the present model with the aforementioned study can be explained as follows: (i) The growth of SEI is assumed to be induced due to the diffusion of electrolyte solvent only across the surface film, which is not practical given the reality of electrolyte solvent mass transport; (ii) The ageing mechanism in the present study is modelled by two electrochemical side reactions by including the effect of EC and DMC electrolyte solvents. While Refs. [17,18,23] included the effects of only EC with a fixed EC diffusion coefficient, whereas the EC diffusion coefficient in this work varies with porosity in time and anode electrode thickness [7]; (iii) In this work, the contributions of the (CH 2 OCO 2 Li) 2 , Li 2 CO 3 solvent products and lithium deposition amount are considered for surface film resistance calculation, however, Li 2 CO 3 contribution is only assumed in Ref. [17,18]. This simplification causes inaccurate local porosity calculation, which is not ideal as one of the main reasons causing nonlinear capacity fade is the sudden local porosity clogging; (iv) The ionic conductivity is a dependent parameter of the products deposited on the active material surface and also local porosity. Therefore, these assumptions bring about the improvement in the results. We expect that our findings will play a key role in the design of better performance and longer life batteries or cells.

        <p>Up until the (~160 cycles) the model demonstrates a near linear capacity fade with a good agreement to the measured data (98.42 of GoF). Beyond the 50 cycles the model continued to predict a near linear fade and predicts an EoL of 294 cycles to reach 80% of initial capacity (indicated by the yellow region in Fig. 4c). As the simulation continues the model demonstrates that around the 370th cycle the nonlinear degradation occurs. These results are significant as they demonstrate how a physics-based ageing model parameterized for CC cycling can validate and forecast battery ageing for a dynamic power profile with nonlinear capacity fade.Up until the (~160 cycles) the model demonstrates a near linear capacity fade with a good agreement to the measured data (98.42 of GoF).

        <p>In this paper, we introduced a novel ageing mechanism that extends the common approach of transport limited models by incorporating (i) multi-layered SEI, (ii) lithium-plating, (iii) reduction of anode porosity. By this approach, we aimed to a gain a fundamental understanding for linear and nonlinear capacity fade by modelling more realistic ageing kinetics. The model is calibrated and validated against both fresh and aged NCA/graphite commercial cell through a series of experiments including (i) constant-current cycling and (ii) dynamic power profile conditions at ambient temperature of 25 • C. The parameters used in the model are experimentally measured and optimized based on the fresh and aged cell (for a C/3 charging -1C discharging CC profile). The model subsequently predicts the linear and nonlinear capacity fades for a different (C/3 charging -4C discharging) CC cycling data with 98% of GoF and predicts better than existing well-accepted ageing models [17,18,22,23]. Moreover, for the first time we validated the terminal voltage response and capacity fade based on a dynamic power profile with a 98.54% and 98.42% GoFs, respectively. Quantifying all these degradation processes precisely will improve lifetime prediction of cell capacity during cell operation. This model will allow us to better predict the lifetime of a Li-ion battery under real operating conditions which required a reliable integration of the battery into an EV application and for warranty evaluations.In this paper, we introduced a novel ageing mechanism that extends the common approach of transport limited models by incorporating (i) multi-layered SEI, (ii) lithium-plating, (iii) reduction of anode porosity.
