        <p>This study supplies contributions to the existing literature with a state-of-the-art bibliometric review of sustainable industrial and operation engineering as the field moves towards Industry 4.0, and guidance for future studies and practical achievements. Although industrial and operation engineering is being promoted forward to sustainability, the systematization of the knowledge that forms firms' manufacturing and operations and encompasses their wide concepts and abundant complementary elements is still absent. This study aims to analyze contemporary sustainable industrial and operations engineering in Industry 4.0 context. The bibliometric analysis and fuzzy Delphi method are proposed. Resulting in a total of 30 indicators that are criticized and clustered into eight study groups, including lean manufacturing in Industry 4.0, cyber-physical production system, big data driven and smart communications, safety and security, artificial intelligence for sustainability, the circular economy in a digital environment, business intelligence and virtual reality, and environmental sustainability.</p>
        <p>Sustainable industrial and operation engineering is understood as the map out and production of goods or services, along with the installation and improvement of integrating systems that based on high-quality, high-fidelity, and real-time data, optimize the operational efficiency in manufacturing systems to create sustainable value and economic growth (Junior et al., 2019;Chauhan et al., 2021). This is imperative process to pursue sustainable development goals since it enables the transformation of original materials into desirable products in order to maintain the life quality and modernization while not causing negative environmental impacts like traditional industrial engineering (Enyoghasi and Badurdeen, 2021). Due to the widespread application of new digital technologies, technological capabilities are important for enabling the transition of industrial and operation engineering to a well-organized, stable, efficient, sustainable, and autonomous form. Revolutionary changes in communication techniques have brought capabilities to firms, giving them greater control and monitoring abilities throughout their production procedures and resulting in more effective operations. Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is a huge technological concept with novel innovations, and involves both digital and physical environment combined by cyber-physical systems (CPS). This accomplishment fosters automated procedures, clever systems having analytical competences through the integration of information technologies, the knowledge from different domains, and a deep interconnection between these domains (Benitez et al., 2020;Onu and Mbohwa, 2021).</p>
        <p>Alcácer and Cruz-Machado (2019) claimed that I4.0 leads to a digitalization that ends conventional applications, and in which digital technologies allow the connection among objects and enable factory communications to build up the smart manufacturing ecosystem paradigm.</p>
        <p>Enyoghasi and Badurdeen (2021) and Chauhan et al. (2021) argued that I4.0 is a motivation for sustainable manufacturing in the industrial scenario since it focuses on creating smart products as well as procedures and offering capabilities for product reuse, remanufacture, recycling, and reduction. Therefore, as a consequence of I4.0 penetration, the need for operations planning schemes to cope with the complexity of industrial environments is highlighted. I4.0 competence has provided firms with ideal opportunities to strengthen sustainable industrial and operations engineering (Sharma et al., 2020). Digitizing manufacturing and business processes by using smarter devices are revealed to offer various advantages, such as effective resource consumption, waste reduction, more efficient control of the production system, output maximization and minimization of resource utilization, overproduction decrease, and energy saving (Kamble et al., 2020). Industrial digitization is proposed to help firms reduce the cost and complexity of waste, achieve energy sustainability across manufacturing processes, diminish defects, and increase the speed of delivering products and services (Ghobakhloo, 2020). Nara et al. (2021) argued the role of I4.0 technologies in catering to better operations control, allowing thereby for real-time adaptation and flexibility based on demands. Thus, integrating I4.0 principles to enhance sustainable industrial and operations engineering enables the maximization of economic, environmental and social benefits (Enyoghasi and Badurdeen, 2021).</p>
        <p>In recent years, many studies with regard to engineering and manufacturing topics have been implemented. For example, Alcácer and Cruz-Machado (2019) reviewed I4.0 in manufacturing environments in enabling technologies and based on the smart factory concept, focused on the fashionable and upcoming trends. Junior et al. (2019) presented the industrial engineering problems related to discrete-event entities' behavior and discussed the way to transport and modify these entities in specific processes adopted for the industrial engineering and production management optimal control scheduling throughout the supply chain. However, the studies on sustainable industrial and operation engineering in the I4.0 context are still in the infant phase; in addition, there is a lack of understanding of its effectiveness and only scattered and fragmented mention of practical examples (Rosa et al., 2020). The reviews on the topic of sustainable industrial and operational engineering are still lacking and to provide the scope of opportunities and future study avenues for enhancing sustainability performance, need to be analyzed based on the I4.0 principles and technologies (Enyoghasi and Badurdeen, 2021). A holistic concept overview describing the most appropriate indicators to advance sustainable industrial and operations engineering through the fulfillment of I4.0 is essential.</p>
        <p>In the industrial and operation engineering area, the enabling I4.0 technologies like CPSs, big data, IoTs, comprise a complex system with high independence and collaboration that enable the management of this system and the uncertainty of infrastructure delivery (Alcácer and Cruz-Machado, 2019; Oztemel and Gursev, 2020). Since sustainable industrial engineering, operations engineering and I4.0 are wide concepts with abundant complementary indicators, to address the challenges of growing complexity, dynamics, high dimensionality, and disorganized structures, an appropriate tool focusing on the conceptualization of the literature is required. This study suggests a compound method, which includes content along with bibliometric analysis, and a fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), to analyze the contemporary sustainable industrial and operations engineering toward I4.0. Content analysis is used to capture the appropriate information more accurately and enables the recognition of important topics through manual or semiautomatic approaches (Bui et al., 2021). An apparent, static and systematic description of the literature is offered by utilizing bibliometric analysis. Through this method, founded on data from Scopus database and by employing 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> to cater visual outcomes, sustainable industrial and operation engineering indicators are identified (Bui et al., 2020). Furthermore, using a systematic approach, a network analysis in a bibliometric literature review is conducted to enhance future studies by deeply analyzing the associations among papers, keywords, citations to transform thoroughly information in the area into clusters comprising study aspects (Tseng et al., 2021).
        </p>
        <p>However, this validation of the indicators can be a highly challenging task, as data provided in many different formats may suffer from various types of ambiguities and inconsistencies. Thus, the FDM is employed to validate more necessary indicators by calculating experts' linguistic evaluations (Tseng et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>There are two objectives in this study:  To examine the fashionable sustainable industrial and operations engineering towards I4.0, as revealed in the literature;  To determine arguments and trends for improving future studies.</p>
        <p>There are two contributions in this study, encompassing (1) useful directions for future studies are suggested by, founded on a review relating to extant literature, providing bibliometric status relating to sustainable industrial and operations engineering toward I4.0; and (2) the decisive matters in need of further investigations are identified for both scholars and practices.</p>
        <p>There are 4 remaining sections in this study. Methodologies, data gathering procedure, suggested analysis steps are thoroughly clarified in second section. Bibliometric analysis, content analysis, FDM results are presented in third section. Then, literature review discourse and the argumentation on upcoming study tendencies are shown in fourth section. Finally, last section gives conclusions, impediments and presentations for imminent studies.</p>
        <p>In second section, analysis stages are presented; data gathering, content and bibliometric analysis, FDM are explained rigorously.</p>
        <p>Content and bibliometric analysis, FDM were used to examine sustainable industrial and operation engineering towards I4.0. Lively diagrams were formed and data consistency was ensured by utilizing 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> software.
        </p>
        <p>The analysis stages are presented below.</p>
        <p>1. For deductive coding in content analysis, an appropriate search term is determined to gather publication knowledge from database of Scopus.</p>
        <p>This study employed content analysis to show a detailed and complete overview of the current knowledge concerning sustainable industrial and operation engineering towards I4.0.</p>
        <p>Content analysis is utilized for completely describing essences of full-text papers and developing an inherent structure for the main papers relating to forming prejudged classes from tightening sizable bundle of texts together with words (Bui et al., 2021). Main characteristic regarding content analysis is to arrange various words within text into much lesser classes. Inductive coding together with deductive coding are two kinds of coding in contemporary employment of content analysis with difference in the means categorizations are obtained. In this study, to find sustainable industrial and operation engineering toward I4.0 literature from the database, the deductive method is first applied for predefined search terms.</p>
        <p>On the account of wider publication collection well as more associated bibliometric framework, Scopus database is exerted in this study (Bui et al., 2020). Collected data include various identifiers, such as title, abstract, author, author affiliation, citation record, author keywords, publishing year, country. Thus, Scopus data are appropriate to evaluate the knowledge of sustainable industrial and operation engineering towards I4.0 literature. This study adopts the search boundary limited before December 26, 2020; narrowed to English-language papers together with reviews. Search terms used were the following: "("industr*" OR "operat*") AND ("engineering") AND ("sustain*") AND ("Industry 4.0" OR "smart technology" OR "smart production" OR "smart manufacturing" OR "internet of things" OR "big data" OR "Artificial intelligence" OR "digital" OR "cyber-physical" OR "Cloud*").</p>
        <p>Thanks to bibliometric analysis, a quantitative approach for managing completely growing literature in particular field and offers science mapping, with a focus more on the studies' aims and patterns is provided (Zupic and Cater, 2015). A full picture of the ongoing study scope is presented, explicit along with objective theoretical complex relating to the discipline are provided and the fundamental clusters in the field are disclosed by a comprehensive bibliometric analysis (Rejeb et al., 2020). This method encourages the analysis of current trends in the literature concerning a certain field, and presenting visual information in the results, it provides directions as well as motivations for future studies. 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> software is a suitable tool for dealing with large data amounts and provides many advanced choices to acquire better bibliometric vivid-image outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>Network analysis is adopted to categorize the clusters and show data variety in study area via indicating distinctions among the publications' keywords. While conventional qualitative methods employ some determined biased elements, this method offers an unbiased way to concentrate and conceptualize the literature into clusters (Tseng et al., 2021). Thus, bibliometric together with network analysis are applied for generally discovering potential research areas and, to be exact, structuring sustainable industrial and operation engineering study tendencies. The transferring process of the input data into valuable information is illustrated by bibliometric graphic visuality built from keyword network analysis.</p>
        <p>Being an inductive content analysis approach, document keywords are utilized in co-word analysis for communicating the scientific framework of a study field. Word understandings presenting co-occurrence associations in the framework are derived founded on the words' repetitiveness in the paper. A keyword is a unit of a co-word analysis, and for organizing the network relationships among varied keywords, keyword frequencies in set of data are employed (Zupic and Cater, 2015). A keyword is depicted by a node in the structure, the frequentness of keywords' co-occurrence is illustrated by magnitude of each node. Among the keywords, a cluster is built for interpreting these keywords' close interrelationships in comparable forms.</p>
        <p>This study made use of 
            <rs type="software">VOSviewer</rs> with version 
            <rs type="version">1.6.11</rs> for constructing bibliometric systems and investigate the literary framework of sustainable industrial and operation engineering towards I4.0, thus catering learning gaps as promising future study tendencies.
        </p>
        <p>For solving problem relating to fuzziness of expert judgments, FDM was beneficial in decreasing the interviews' amount along with investigation duration, offered a more</p>
        <p>Table 1 shows the linguistic scale to alter the linguistic terms into triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). The convex combination value 𝐸 𝑥 is counted as follows:</p>
        <p>In which:</p>
        <p>𝜀 is adopted to address the decision makers' optimistic level and to create a judgment balance among the expert group.</p>
        <p>The 𝛾 generally ranges from 0 to 1 founded on if perceptions from experts are positive or negative. To express 𝛾 under the common condition, this study uses 0.5.</p>
        <p>Finally, the threshold 𝜎 is calculated to validate more necessary indicators.</p>
        <p>(n: the number of indicator) (4)</p>
        <p>The results of data collection, network analysis, co-word analysis and the FDM analysis are revealed in this part.</p>
        <p>In the data collection process, 436 articles and reviews were approached. The result from VOSviewer shows that 48 keywords appeared at least three times, and their distribution is displayed through bibliographic framework.</p>
        <p>Figure 2 The detailed labeling of eight clusters is conducted in Table 2 The results reveal that topics related to these clusters were all researched in recent years, including indicators that are studied quite a great deal and others that have just begun to popularize. Concerning Table 2, the higher weight and average published year reveal that there are newer indicators, such as the following: digitalization, integration, and lean manufacturing from cluster 1; energy consumption from cluster 2; sustainable manufacturing from cluster 3; digital twin, maintenance, and blockchain from cluster 4; skills in cluster 5; CE, digital transformation, and I4.0 in cluster 6; and deep learning in cluster 7. The latest cluster is CE in a digital environment, revealing the currently considered studies that need more attention.</p>
        <p>From the bibliometric analysis and co-word analysis, 48 keywords are proposed for evaluation based on the experts' judgments. The FDM process for the original set of indicators is explained in Table 3 by using equations ( 1)-( 4).</p>
        <p>This section discusses eight study fields comprising the following: lean manufacturing in I4.0; big data driven and smart communication; CPPSs; safety and security; AI for sustainability; CE in a digital environment; business intelligence and virtual reality; and environmental sustainability. As a necessary basis for I4.0 execution, lean manufacturing is employed since the streamlined and waste-free process and standardized procedure attained throughout a lean transformation eases future attempts to automatize and digitalize the manufacturing process (Buer et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>However, the synergy between the two mechanisms needs to be taken into consideration to aim at operational excellence, as I4.0 targets accelerate information flows and lean manufacturing concentrates on waste elimination to promote physical flows. Optimistic synergistic association between advanced production technologies and lean disciplines in anticipating operational achievement regarding expense, lead period, product quality, flexibility is supported. By the interactions between information technologies with lean practices, reciprocacity between production technologies and lean procedures is shaped and manipulated (Khanchanapong et al., 2014). Thus, the value to customers is added, and resources are optimally utilized in the interest of combination of lean manufacturing with I4.0 application, resulting in greatly responsive synthesis and creating value-added streams in the most efficient way (Sony and Naik, 2020).</p>
        <p>Lean manufacturing is an achievable approach for firm endurance in I4.0. Prior studies have focused on how I4.0 is related to lean manufacturing together with its effects on firm accomplishment. Despite high costs together with challenges in its implementation, lean digitization, characterized as the integration of lean manufacturing and digitalization, eventually gives firms better competitiveness (Ghobakhloo and Fathi, 2020). For example, lean manufacturing practices are affiliated with I4.0 technologies positively with simultaneous application resulting in greater performance improvements (Tortorella and Fettermann, 2019).</p>
        <p>I4.0 technologies moderate lean manufacturing impact on operational attainment enhancement in contrasting paths. In particular, technologies pertaining to product or service moderate influence concerning flow operations on achievement positively while process-pertained technologies moderate influence of low-setup operations on achievement negatively. When lean manufacturing disciplines are widely executed in the firm, it is easier to adopt higher levels of I4.0. However, the firms' readiness to apply contemporary technologies is lower in case procedures are not strongly devised and consecutive enhancement practices are not set up. However, prior studies were only concerned with defining the conditions of adopting highly technological methods to improve existing approaches, but did not propose solutions to deal with current barriers. Despite certain solutions have been provided, modern productions with smart machines are not enough to comprehensively promote all the expected I4.0 benefits, and there is still a need to enable the generation of new powerful smart communication networks.</p>
        <p>Big data-driven and smart communication in a supply chain is argued to help to increase economic benefits, such as cost savings, a strengthening of coordination and a faster adapting to market demands (Tseng et al., 2019). While IoT is acknowledged to facilitate the reliable transfer of information between "things and processes", the combination between IoTs and big data-</p>
        <p>Safety and security in I4.0 are defined as the secure interaction between independent systems and humans and the avoidance of the interference of digital networks that create damage and an interruption of procedures, including and up to the destruction of manufacturing systems (Weber et al., 2019). In the process of implementing I4.0 with highly independent and collaborative components, the management of complex infrastructure to ensure safety and security factors is required (Oztemel and Gursev, 2020). The academic and empirical study efforts, along with production innovation, all aim to create smart factories which support costeffective, sustainable, safe and secure manufacturing systems (Tuptuk and Hailes, 2018). The integration with I4.0 capabilities empowers a safe and secure environment that encourages more ethical and moral behaviors that can increase sustainability through mutual cooperation.</p>
        <p>Focusing on a smart system design under development or demonstrating a failure effect model for investigating cause and effect, prior studies have analyzed safety and security as issues.</p>
        <p>For example, the safety aspect is emphasized to protect the system from unexpected faults, whereas the security aspect includes protection from both foreseen and unforeseen hazards throughout the application of cyber-physical system (Kavallieratos et al., 2020). Security issue is considered as a secondary matter rather than a vital element of deployment operation, while the existing industrial and manufacturing systems are easily vulnerable to cyber-based attacks in poorly trained and prepared firms (Tuptuk and Hailes, 2018). Further, there is a shortcoming in reporting this aspect as a key driver of further implementation of I4.0 and digitalization procedures, although the indicators of safety and security are still being developed to improve process performance (Lee et al., 2019). A recurring obstacle of the existing studies on the joint security and safety concerns that need to be overcome is that these studies do not identify conflicts and largely neglect the examination of the fulfilment of distinct security objectives (Kavallieratos et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>The increasing number of cyber-attacks is a main challenge to I4.0 implementation, and applying advanced technology devices without caring of safety and security makes the industrial engineering among the highest vulnerable industries, highlighting the need for more secure and reliable frameworks for machines and operators in industrial manufacturing systems. Safety and security in networks are necessary because they help to prevent employees from dangerous situations when working in manufacturing industry (Khalid et al., 2018). The consideration of safety and security is seen as a continuing procedure starting at or before designing step, and the occurrence of new barriers requires a basic evaluation of the entire plant's security (Tuptuk and Hailes, 2018). Although IoTs provide firms with insight of the way their systems truly operate throughout the entirety of procedures, the study on safety and security issues related to IoT programs concluded that in complicated platforms with multi data flows, most approaches lacked a consideration of security issues (Ogonji et al., 2020). As one of core I4.0 technologies, blockchain has been adopted to guarantee security and solve numerous traditional threats by creating attack-resistant and digital data storage and by providing a sharing platform that employs linked block structures to verify and synchronize data (Bhushan et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the human factors of safety and security also need examination because humans can be harmed by inaccurate operation systems, or severe injuries can occur during the interaction process with autonomous systems (Weber et al., 2019). Studies researching human factor application generally find that both the human outcomes and the system benefits gained are considerably greater. While safety issues and security issues are argued to be key factors in the development of modern systems, the failure to adequately address human factor issues in working environment also causes serious risks in operationalization procedures; nonetheless, there is still lack of studies on this topic when researching I4.0 area (Neumann et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>Further, in I4.0 transition, whereas studies on the machine-centered manufacturing industry highlighted the smart factory concept of the future as digitized and comprising automated systems, human factors and their well-being were neglected; thus, need further attention (Kadir and Broberg, 2021). Furthermore, AI systems enable natural language processing to ease communication, store information, automate reasoning, and facilitate machine learning to comply with different business environment (Loureiro et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Prior studies have applied AI experiments for theoretical processes as well as realistic solutions (Goralski and Tan, 2020). Although AI is not a new academic field of study, it has only recently been acknowledged for a set of applications in technological developments. AI applications are an attention field of study involving computational intelligent techniques used to design and manufacture products in traditional sectors (Jimeno-Morenilla et al., 2021). For example, studies on AI for sustainability mainly focused on machine learning techniques and algorithms in order to present the way devices examine and gain knowledge from collected information (Nishant et al., 2020). In fashion industry, AI is adopted to deal with difficult problems in all manufacturing process stages, which then could be completed in a shorter time under AI than under the traditional approach. Studies in chemistry manufacturing show the AI function in greater and quicker synthesizing new organic compounds to produce medicament drugs (Lenoir et al., 2020). However, the potential of disruptive AI technology to enhance sustainable manufacturing is still shortcoming. Although AI has a positive effect on sustainability goals through technological innovations, studies on this issue are still lacking (Liu et al., 2020). Thus, there is a need for robust study methodology to evaluate AI's longstanding impact and address the privacy issues resulting from AI application.</p>
        <p>In the I4.0 era, AI is seen as one of the most progressive techniques that will have remarkable effects in several fields, and the support of big data has enhanced AI power as well (Duan et al., 2019). Big data is capable of changing the approach firms use to handle conventional supply networks, whereas AI enables a system to collect and achieve knowledge from various data sources to further accomplish specific tasks; thus, big data and AI integration enhances sustainability opportunities throughout production area (Bag et al., 2021). This concept is considered not only an internal technological innovation but also an external cause that promotes other innovations and is therefore critical for manufacturing firms to maintain stability (Liu et al., 2020). AI is argued to be critical for smart manufacturing through the improvement of safety control and efficiency in consuming materials and energy (Mao et al., 2019). Further, AI applications also assist manufacturing systems in predicting long-term demands and deciding production quantity every day to decrease unnecessary operations (Frank et al., 2019). AI positively affects manufacturing in low-income countries since it offers new opportunities to break the cycle of poverty; however, in advanced countries, it is considered negatively due to the fear of job loss (Ahmad et al., 2021). Consequently, whereas AI is a potential motivation for sustainability improvement, the adoption of this technology still creates unwanted results that require deep study to find solutions.</p>
        <p>Since a high level of competition in business requires firms to change their manufacturing process, one of the best ways to utilize resources is by applying CE practices within operations (Rosa et al., 2020). While current system links with the linear perspective enduring industrial manufacture, CE is seen as a more sustainable model and an appropriate selection to take place of the linear model, in which resources are circulated (Sarja et al., 2021). CE in a digital environment is considered as a method applying emerging innovative technologies to recover usable material from used products and redistribute them in the production line (Chauhan et al., 2021). The benefits of this concept consist of decreasing environmental effects, boosting financial performance, adopting recycled and recovered resources to lessen sustainability pressure through an overall system change. While CE is argued to support the circularity in manufacturing processes, I4.0 is presented as a digital environment that enhances CE development.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, promoting I4.0 technologies to manage the operational process is still vulnerable since it is complicated to define valid measurement and elements' interrelationship to comprise this process (Bui et al., 2020). Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is urgent to improve sustainable performance by combining I4.0 and CE.</p>
        <p>Although there are firm links between CE and sustainability, there is still theoretical and practical uncertainty regarding its principles (Sarja et al., 2021). Innovation business models are implied to enable firms adapting to CE principles; yet, available analysis on how to strategically implement and systematically understand organizational obstacles and the catalyst for CErelated changes is still lacking (Centobelli et al., 2020). Furthermore, there is also an emphasis on the significance of CE and emerging technologies such as I4.0, which promote efficient waste in smart cities; nevertheless, lack of studies considered CE in I4.0 with smart waste management (Chauhan et al., 2021). In addition, the advantage of digitalization on CE enhancement is comparatively untouched, despite CE is on the rise, and I4.0 is acknowledged as the most imperative attribute in digitalizing procedure (Bag et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>Firms need to transform to remain competitive since I4.0 has driven a wave of technologies that lead to the digitization and simplification in business (Bag et al., 2021). Digital transformation or digitization through innovative technologies shared between the physical and real environment has supported firms to achieve competitive advantage and differentiate a firm from competitors. The significant digital transformations in I4.0 are argued to result in numerous advantages (Ghobakhloo, 2020). For example, digitization enables a fully digital CE accomplishment through higher transparency of process centralization and requires firms to improve key indicators of flexibility, efficiency, productivity, and quality and to establish critical security measures (Dutta et al., 2020). However, in the CE transition process, the study of firms changing from the old industrial styles to inter-connected enterprises in I4.0 era is neglected (Frank et al., 2019). Further, the implications of this process for the firm's capacity and innovative performance are also not clear and need to be exploited in the future (Fernández-Rovira et al., 2021). It is essential for a well-understood digitization standard, and each stage of this process needs to be clarified and proceeded. Although new technology transformations create challenges to I4.0 implementation, they still guide firms to achieve lasting competitiveness and adaptation to changes of operating environment. However, implementing CE in I4.0 requires the development of different and more specialized skills (Sony and Naik, 2020). Nevertheless, from such a perspective and in the context of the attention to human factors and ergonomics, a study of this topic characterized as a sociotechnical system that contains both social and technical aspects is still missing.</p>
        <p>As the business environment becomes more competitive and the information advantage increases, business intelligence, which applies data analytics techniques to create decisive information to support and optimize decision-making, contributes to strategic planning process of a firm. Business intelligence is considered an effective solution that provides a valuable tool and fundamental approach to increase a firm's value by facilitating the understanding of a firm's information assets, including customer and supply chain data, manufacturing, sales, marketing information and other operational data sources, allowing firms to integrate a consistent framework for real-time reporting combined with a detailed analysis (Chen and Lin, 2020). The concept enables firms to actively sense changing business circumstances and transform business processes for optimal resource allocation and utilization, which drives the firms' operations to achieve profitability and competitiveness.</p>
        <p>I4.0 involves the digital transformation of production processes via incorporating production systems, appliances along with data analytics for facilitating the ability of manufacturing machines to make choices founded on provided data together with machine learning algorithms (Papananias et al., 2020). Particularly, machine learning emphasizing the principles that form an algorithm can grasp and forecast the consequence by identifying an underlying archetype in input information and by generating logical associations through employing statistical method (Injadat et al., 2021). As a potential answer to contemporary manufacturing system challenges, such as growing complexity, dynamic, high dimensionality, and disorganized structures, machine learning's advantages and disadvantages from a manufacturing perspective are discussed.</p>
        <p>Machine learning methods are an encouraging approach favoring the manufacturing industry concerning the entire operations and processes (Sharp et al., 2018). For manufacturing systems, the execution of a machine learning algorithm enables a machine or other gadget to grasp its baseline along with working states spontaneously and can generate and promote a knowledge base during production process (Chen, 2020). Machine learning is also employed in many aspects of additive manufacturing to enhance the whole design and manufacturing workflow (Goh et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Deep learning, as an advance in AI, presents distinguished performance for many applications, like speech recognition, natural language processing, and image replication; it comprises a group of machine learning techniques that apply artificial recurrent neural networks with a more complicated architecture grasping complex features by connecting the data and computationally efficient training algorithms (Lin et al., 2020). Production is converted into greatly optimal smart facilities offering advantages in terms of decreasing operating expenses, matching with unstable customer need, enhancing capacity, attaining better visibility, diminishing spare time, obtaining more operations' value for international competition by virtue of breakthrough analytics supported by deep learning. Moreover, by enabling the transformation of the unprecedented data amount into actionable and intelligent information, this concept also provides contemporary visibility into operations together with real-time attainment means as well as costs for decision-makers (Wang et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>Virtual reality as a unique approach for connecting with the developing digital landscape is characterized as technologies' set that facilitate people not only to immersive sight beyond reality but also to hear, touch and even to communicate with virtual objects (Guo et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Virtual reality tools are part of smart functionality in I4.0 relating to the employees' tasks, allowing them to become more energetic and responsive in order to follow requirements of manufacturing system (Frank et al., 2019). In business, technology is anticipated to be imperative because of its basic reimagination in the manners firms associate with consumers and improvement in the manufacturing process, product design, prototyping (de Regt et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the integration of human-robot simulation with virtual reality assists in estimating cycle time, establishing process plans, layout optimization and developing robot control programs, making it a promising technology with a growing capability to make maximum sense of the capability of artificial reality in changing how humans perform activities (Malik et  Big data-driven and smart communications help generate an efficient interacting system, thus, improving sustainable industrial and operational efficiency. However, there is still a lack of studies on new powerful smart communication networks to enhance all the expected I4.0 goals. Moreover, the increasing communication issues between machines also call for further studies.  A multi-facet approach and a hybrid environmental sustainability assessment plan, as well as public policy and multilateral agreements for managing the unpredictable environmental sustainability influences of I4.0, require further examination. The smart cities' potentiality in dealing with ecological matters and waste management needs to be investigated with a consideration of the effects of policy, rule, technology arrangement, product planning strategies, and extensive citizen involvement.</p>
        <p>There are some limitations for this study. First, the Scopus database was used in this study.</p>
        <p>Despite its broad scope, it also includes low impact sources. Therefore, future studies should employ other databases or incorporate different sources to enhance the generalizability of the results. Second, only articles and review papers were utilized in the review process; hence, to expand the data coverage, pertinent books along with book chapters should be embedded in future study. Third, the expert panel comprising only 15 members is able to induce analysis prejudice as a result of their understanding, practice, familiarity with the study area. To prevent such problems, increasing the number of respondents is recommended for future studies.</p>
