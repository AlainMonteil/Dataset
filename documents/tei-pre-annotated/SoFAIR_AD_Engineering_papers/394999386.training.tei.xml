        <p>The evolution of intelligent manufacturing has had a profound and lasting effect on the future of global manufacturing. Industry 4.0 based smart factories merge physical and cyber technologies, making the involved technologies more intricate and accurate; improving the performance, quality, controllability, management, and transparency of manufacturing processes in the era of the internet-of-things (IoT). Advanced low-cost sensor technologies are essential for gathering data and utilizing it for effective performance by manufacturing companies and supply chains. Different types of low power/low cost sensors allow for greatly expanded data collection on different devices across the manufacturing processes. While a lot of research has been carried out with a focus on analyzing the performance, processes, and implementation of smart factories, most firms still lack in-depth insight into the difference between traditional and smart factory systems, as well as the wide set of different sensor technologies associated with Industry 4.0. This paper identifies the different available sensor technologies of Industry 4.0, and identifies the differences between traditional and smart factories. In addition, this paper reviews existing research that has been done on the smart factory; and therefore provides a broad overview of the extant literature on smart factories, summarizes the variations between traditional and smart factories, outlines different types of sensors used in a smart factory, and creates an agenda for future research that encompasses the vigorous evolution of Industry 4.0 based smart factories.The evolution of intelligent manufacturing has had a profound and lasting effect on the future of global manufacturing.

        <p>With its introduction in Germany in 2011, Industry 4.0 instantly became the focus of a global world that promoted the computerization of manufacturing [1]. Industry 4.0 has revolutionized the manufacturing process, leading to intelligent manufacturing promising self-sufficient manufacturing processes by using machines and devices that communicate with each other through digital connectivity [2,3]. Although most of the design philosophies and technologies of Industry 4.0, such as the internet of things (IoT), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and artificial intelligence are already in use, most firms lack insight into the wide set of technologies offered by Industry 4.0 that provide devices with seamless connectivity, interoperability, visibility, and intelligence capabilities.With its introduction in Germany in 2011, Industry 4.0 instantly became the focus of a global world that promoted the computerization of manufacturing [1].

        <p>Applications in traditional manufacturing are stand-alone and segregated [4], and lack automated monitoring and control capabilities [5]. There are a series of distinct and independent steps, including marketing, product development, manufacturing, and distribution to customers [1]. As a result, the reuse of systems, and the integration of physical and digital systems, in traditional manufacturing is poor [6]. Some advanced manufacturing strategies, such as intelligent manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, and agile manufacturing have the potential to overcome the drawbacks of traditional manufacturing [7][8][9]. These manufacturing schemes are the pioneers of Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing, where machines and products interact with each other without, or with minimal, human control [4,6].Applications in traditional manufacturing are stand-alone and segregated [4], and lack automated monitoring and control capabilities [5].

        <p>Manufacturing industry plays a crucial role in the evolution of modern society. Industry 4.0, which is the pioneer of smart factories, has access to various advanced technologies such as big data analytics, artificial intelligence, advanced robotics, 3D printing, and cloud computing [1,3]. The vast implementation of computer numerical control (CNC) and industrial robots has enabled a flexibility in manufacturing systems [10][11][12]; whereas computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided processing planning (CAPP) have made computer integrated manufacturing practical [13,14]. The actual uses of the IoT have enabled manufacturers to adopt digital transformations from different prospects, such as efficient productivity, automation, customer focus, competitive advantages, and enhancing the value chain and rapid returns [15,16].Manufacturing industry plays a crucial role in the evolution of modern society.

        <p>In an attempt to understand the efficient use of the IoT in the manufacturing industry, it is imperative to recognize the different technologies, especially sensors that make the performance of manufacturing firms efficient in using Industry 4.0. By combining everyday objects with connected devices through IoT, it is possible to gather information, analyze it, and create an action that learns from processes. The focal objective of the concept of Industry 4.0 is to characterize highly digitized manufacturing processes, where flow of information amid different devices is controlled in an environment with very limited human intervention [3,5,17]. Cloud-based IoT platforms have the ability to connect the real world with the virtual world, enabling companies to manage IoT device connectivity and flexibility [18]. In addition, the IoT architecture must be flexible enough to operate different wireless protocols and accommodate additions of new sensor inputs (e.g., USB) [19]. This can also be acknowledged in terms of physical flexibility, which can include wearable devices, carry devices, battery usage, etc. [7]. The use of sensors makes this achievable.In an attempt to understand the efficient use of the IoT in the manufacturing industry, it is imperative to recognize the different technologies, especially sensors that make the performance of manufacturing firms efficient in using Industry 4.0.

        <p>Although automation has become a crucial part of the factory, innovative manufacturers have taken the opportunity to take it to a whole new level through the application of IoT and artificial intelligence in production processes. With enhancing the complexity of cyber physical systems, the physical machines and business processes have combined with automation to give rise to complex optimization decisions that were made traditionally by humans [5,21,22]. This has enabled manufacturers to integrate the floor decisions and perceptions with the supply chain, giving birth to what we now call a smart factory. The introduction of mechanical manufacturing equipment marked the first industrial revolution, followed by the development of the mass production of goods [13]. The digital revolution was considered to be the adoption of increased automation and control in manufacturing processes by using electronics and IT [12]. The adoption of IoT in these processes has given rise to the deviation of the centralized factory system to a decentralized system [12][13][14]. This technology has enabled machines and industries to go through a self-optimization and reconfiguration, to adapt their behavior to changes in orders and operating conditions [23,24]. The core of smart factories is the technology that makes data collection possible. This technology includes intelligent sensors, motors, and robotics which are employed on the production and assembly lines of the manufacturing industry [17].Although automation has become a crucial part of the factory, innovative manufacturers have taken the opportunity to take it to a whole new level through the application of IoT and artificial intelligence in production processes.

        <p>In order to meet drastic changes in customer demands, the manufacturing process requires abilities that help in adjusting product type and production capacity, to enable the handling of multiple product varieties [25]. Manufacturing should have adequate functionality, scalability, and connectivity with customers and suppliers to meet such challenges. Traditional factories lack capabilities that allow them to monitor and control automated and complex manufacturing to enable efficient production of customized products [26]. Traditional factories have stand-alone and segregated applications with less integration of the production system, product life cycle, and value chain. Consequently, there is poor reuse of systems and integration between real and virtual systems in a traditional set-up.

The smart factory is an upgrade from old-fashioned automation to a linked and flexible system, and which constitutes a continual data stream through highly connected operations and production systems which can learn and adapt to changing demands [26][27][28]. These factories can assimilate data from physical, operational, and human assets to drive manufacturing, maintenance, inventory tracking, digitization of operations, and other activities in manufacturing systems [29].

It is an engineering system that operates on interconnection, collaboration, and execution. Interconnecting devices in smart factories allow the exchange of information, recognize and assess situations, and integrate the physical world with the digital world, making smart factories adaptive in nature [23,31]. In other words, the smart factory integrates physical and cyber technologies and makes the involved technologies more accurate, enhancing the performance, quality, controllability, management, and transparency of the manufacturing processes. In such a smart factory environment, the manufacturer has the ability to meet customer requirements by changing the production specifications and other settings of the machines at the last minute. This ability is not present in traditional factories [32] (Table 1). The true feature of a smart factory lies in its capability to readjust and evolve along with the growing needs of the organization [32,33]. These needs can be categorized into: changing customer demands, emergence of new markets, development of new products and services, enhanced productive approaches to operations, and use of advanced technologies in maintenance processes [13,34,35]. The ability to tailor and learn from real-time data makes smart factories more receptive and predictive, to avoid operational downtime and other possible failures in processes [12,29].In order to meet drastic changes in customer demands, the manufacturing process requires abilities that help in adjusting product type and production capacity, to enable the handling of multiple product varieties [25].

These improvements have not only altered the factory floor infrastructure, promoting steady and precise collaboration between machines, but have also altered machinery requirements, increasing demand for reliable sensors [10].

This section gives brief information about the key sensors used in a smart factory.</p>
        <p>The current manufacturing system is defined by different technologies, however the main technologies used are sensors, actuators, effectors, controllers, and control loops [36]. A vital role is played by sensors in a smart factory, as they collect and implement accurate data into the manufacturing processes to enhance product quality. Sensors are electrical, opto-electrical, or electronic devices consisting of sensitive materials that help to determine the presence of a particular entity or function [37]. In many cases, a physical stimulus is transformed into an electrical signal using sensors, which then can be evaluated and analyzed for making decisions about the operations being carried out [5,36]. Recent developments in sensor technology have enabled manufacturers to control and acquire data like never before.The current manufacturing system is defined by different technologies, however the main technologies used are sensors, actuators, effectors, controllers, and control loops [36].

        <p>Sensors can operate either actively or passively [36,38]. When operating actively, a particular physical stimulus is required for the sensor to work. For example, color identification sensors are active as they need visible light to illuminate the object so that the sensor can receive a physical stimulus. In the passive instance, the physical stimulus is already present and does not have to be provided [38]. For example, infrared devices are passive as the stimulus is already being generated from infrared radiation that is linked with the temperature of a body.Sensors can operate either actively or passively [36,38].

        <p>Several types of sensors have been developed and used successfully in industrial process control. Smart factories use a variety of sensor types, from basic temperature to humidity monitoring to sophisticated position and product sensing [39,40]. These sensors make manufacturing efficient by helping in advance factory operations, such as moving products, controlling robotic and milling processes, and sensing environmental factors. The main measurement and control parameters in a factory environment are temperature, position, force, pressure, and flow [40].Several types of sensors have been developed and used successfully in industrial process control.

        <p>As temperature directly affects material properties and product quality, it is one of the crucial parameters to be measured and controlled in industrial plants. A temperature sensor is a device that has the ability to collect temperature concerned information from a resource, and then changes it into information that can be understood by another device [41]. These sensors have the ability to measure the thermal characteristics of gases, liquids, and solids. Several temperature sensors have been developed in recent years which can be used in electrically and chemically hostile environments. These sensors can be divided into two groups: (1) low-temperature sensors, with a range of -100 to +400 • C, using sensing materials such as phosphors, semi-conductors, and liquid crystals; and (2) high-temperature sensors with a range of 500 to 2000 • C, based on blackbody radiations [25,40,42]. Table 2 shows the different sub-types of temperature sensor, along with their key features.As temperature directly affects material properties and product quality, it is one of the crucial parameters to be measured and controlled in industrial plants.

Several temperature sensors have been developed in recent years which can be used in electrically and chemically hostile environments. These sensors can be divided into two groups: (1) low-temperature sensors, with a range of -100 to +400 • C, using sensing materials such as phosphors, semi-conductors, and liquid crystals; and (2) high-temperature sensors with a range of 500 to 2000 • C, based on blackbody radiations [25,40,42]. Table 2 shows the different sub-types of temperature sensor, along with their key features.</p>
        <p>Pressure sensors have the ability to capture pressure changes and transform them into an electrical signal, where the applied pressure defines its quantity. These are electro-mechanical devices that identify force in gases or liquids and provide control signals to display devices [25,37,43]. These sensors can also be used to detect atmospheric changes [51]. For example, barometric pressure sensors have the ability to detect changes in the atmosphere that are helpful for the prediction of weather patterns and changes. Another example is vacuum sensors, which are used when pressure in a vacuum is below atmospheric pressure levels, which can be difficult to detect using mechanical methods. Table 3 shows the different sub-types of pressure sensors along with their key features. Costly; susceptible to interference from environmental effects and physical damage.Pressure sensors have the ability to capture pressure changes and transform them into an electrical signal, where the applied pressure defines its quantity.

Motion sensors (which trigger actions such as illuminating a floodlight by detecting movement of an object) and proximity sensors (which detect that an object has come within the range of a sensor) are worth mentioning as they serve functions similar to position sensors [59,60].

        <p>Force sensors are designated to translate applied forces (such as tensile, compressive force, etc.) into electric signals which reflect the degree of force [63,64]. These signals are then sent to indicators, controllers, or computers that inform operators about the processes, or serve as inputs that help to achieve control over machinery and processes. A variety of force sensors are being used in smart factories depending on the type of force being measured [65]. For instance, load cells measure compressive forces, strain gauges measure the internal resistance forces, and force sensing resistors measure the rate of change of an applied force.

        <p>Among other recent advances in technology, smart sensors have been in the spotlight in terms of their potential significance and wide range of application areas. With the integration of computing and IoT in industrial processes, ordinary sensors have been transformed into smart sensors providing them with abilities to carry out complex calculations with collected data [37,40]. Apart from increased capabilities, smart sensors have also become remarkably small and exceedingly flexible, turning bulky machines into high-tech intel. Equipped with signal conditioning, embedded algorithms, and digital interfaces, smart sensors have become devices with detection and self-awareness capabilities [25,72]. These sensors are built as IoT components that convert real-time information into digital data that can be transmitted to a gateway [36,73]. These abilities allow smart sensors to predict and monitor real time scenarios and take corrective actions in an instant.

For instance, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are one of the applications of smart sensors, whose nodes are connected with one or more other sensors and sensor hubs, making a communication technology of some kind. In addition, information from multiple sensors can be combined to deduce conclusions about an existing problem; for instance, temperature and pressure sensor data can be used to infer the onset of a mechanical failure.

        <p>This paper has discussed the different types of sensor technology used in the manufacturing industry, specifically in smart factories. An extensive review of the extant literature is also presented on the technology lead smart factory. Key differences between a smart factory and traditional factory have been highlighted. Use of sensors, interoperability of different IoT devices, integration of robotics and AI, and use of VR techniques were found to be the key intelligent features of a smart factory. As sensors are an important component of a smart factory, the main sensor types and their sub-types, along with their characteristics, materials, uses, application areas, advantages and disadvantages have been identified in this paper.

        <p>While aspects of the smart factory have been successfully implemented in several key industries (e.g., the chemical industry), it has been found that there are technological, cost, and knowledge barriers to the broader implementation of sensors across manufacturing [20]. These barriers also include standardization, cyber security, and risk concerns, which may enhance organizational resistance to automation within the factory. In terms of standardization, two Industry 4.0 reference architectures have been standardized, namely, Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0, from the International Electrotechnical Commission, and Industrial Internet Reference Architecture, from the Object Management Group. A discussion on these standardized architectures and the compatibility of each Industry 4.0 proposal to these standards is needed. Moreover, the concept of digital twin in the manufacturing system configuration stage, which can enable the validation of system performance in a semi-physical simulation manner, is gaining interest. The digital twin conducts a direct test and validation that can quickly locate the problem and malfunctioning part, rectify the design mistakes, and test the workability of equipment in the system execution [76,77]. In addition, a deficiency of labor skills and manufacturer technical willingness relative to available technologies can be limiting. It has been revealed that there is a scarcity of studies that address these issues. Furthermore, artificial intelligence, block chain, cloud computing, and big data analytics (also known as ABCD) are known for the generation of information technology [76]. The employment of blockchain in smart factories is known to enable increased security, enhanced traceability, and reduced costs [76,77]. These features along with standardization and cyber security issues need a detailed study and therefore, are identified as a future extension of this work.While aspects of the smart factory have been successfully implemented in several key industries (e.g., the chemical industry), it has been found that there are technological, cost, and knowledge barriers to the broader implementation of sensors across manufacturing [20].
