        <p>Background: Lateral flow device (LFD) viral antigen immunoassays have been developed around the world as diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection. They have been proposed to deliver an infrastructure-light, costeconomical solution giving results within half an hour. Methods: LFDs were initially reviewed by a Department of Health and Social Care team, part of the UK government, from which 64 were selected for further evaluation from 1st August to 15th December 2020. Standardised laboratory evaluations, and for those that met the published criteria, field testing in the Falcon-C19 research study and UK pilots were performed (UK COVID-19 testing centres, hospital, schools, armed forces). Findings: 4/64 LFDs so far have desirable performance characteristics (orient Gene, Deepblue, Abbott and Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test). All these LFDs have a viral antigen detection of &gt;90% at 100,000 RNA copies/ml. 8951 Innova LFD tests were performed with a kit failure rate of 5.6% (502/8951, 95% CI: 5.1À6.1), false positive rate of 0.32% (22/6954, 95% CI: 0.20À0.48). Viral antigen detection/sensitivity across the sampling cohort when performed by laboratory scientists was 78.8% (156/198, 95% CI 72.4À84.3). Interpretation: Our results suggest LFDs have promising performance characteristics for mass population testing and can be used to identify infectious positive individuals. The Innova LFD shows good viral antigen detection/sensitivity with excellent specificity, although kit failure rates and the impact of training are potential issues. These results support the expanded evaluation of LFDs, and assessment of greater access to testing on COVID-19 transmission.Background: Lateral flow device (LFD) viral antigen immunoassays have been developed around the world as diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        <p>National governments and international organisations including the World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Commission have highlighted the importance of individual testing, mass population testing and subsequent contact tracing to halt the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 [1,2,3]. The current diagnostic test involves reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of nose/ throat swabs in specialised laboratories. Such capacity in the UK is currently estimated at ~500,000 tests/day [4À7]. and this is used with contact tracing procedures and mobile applications to identify close symptomatic contacts of infected symptomatic individuals [8À10]. However, there are significant challenges in creating testing capacity to identify those with asymptomatic infections or to test contacts of individuals with COVID-19. To date, turnaround time for issuing results from RT-PCR has been typically slow (&gt;24 h), though, the time of test of RT-PCR is usually a few hours.National governments and international organisations including the World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Commission have highlighted the importance of individual testing, mass population testing and subsequent contact tracing to halt the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 [1,2,3].

        <p>To better understand and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there is an urgent need for large-scale, accurate, affordable and rapid diagnostic testing assays, with the ability to detect infectious individuals. Lateral flow device (LFD) immunoassays can be designed to test for different protein targets and are routinely used in healthcare settings principally as a result of their affordability, ease of use, short turnaround time, and high-test accuracy. In brief, a sample is placed on a conjugation pad where the analyte (or antigen) of interest is bound by conjugated antibodies. The analyte-antibody mix subsequently migrates along a membrane by capillary flow across both 'test' and 'control' strips. These strips are coated with antibodies detecting the analyte of interest and a positive test is confirmed by the appearance of coloured control and test lines [11].To better understand and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there is an urgent need for large-scale, accurate, affordable and rapid diagnostic testing assays, with the ability to detect infectious individuals.

        <p>Newly developed SARS-CoV-2 antigen LFDs identify the presence of specific viral proteins, using conjugated antibodies to bind spike, envelope, membrane or nucleocapsid proteins. In contrast to the IgM/IgG "antibody tests", these antigen tests directly identify viral proteins, and are not reliant on the host's immune response. In contrast to RT-PCR, results for LFDs are observed in 10À30 min depending on the device, providing a window for early interventions to halt the chain of transmission earlier in the disease course when individuals are most infectious [12].Newly developed SARS-CoV-2 antigen LFDs identify the presence of specific viral proteins, using conjugated antibodies to bind spike, envelope, membrane or nucleocapsid proteins.

        <p>To date, many manufacturers have developed first-generation rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting LFDs. However, many of these tests have not been independently validated. There is evidence of variable performance when assessing test sensitivity and specificity, although several candidates looked promising on the basis of early data [13À15]. An independent national evaluation of these devices is important to facilitate population-level or mass testing initiatives globally.To date, many manufacturers have developed first-generation rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting LFDs.

        <p>The DHSC identified manufacturers supplying SARS-CoV-2 antigen LFDs that could enable mass testing at a population level. A desktop review was performed to ensure there were appropriate instructions for use and to assess manufacturers' claimed performance and manufacturing capabilities. Manufacturers were not assessed if they had limited evidence of efficacy, a low manufacturing capacity, in very early stages of development or unwilling to supply kits for testing in the UK development pipeline.The DHSC identified manufacturers supplying SARS-CoV-2 antigen LFDs that could enable mass testing at a population level.

        <p>Pre-clinical evaluation of candidate LFDs was performed by trained laboratory scientists at Public Health England (PHE) Porton Down. LFDs were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 spiked positive controls and known negative controls, consisting of saliva collected from healthy adult staff volunteers. Approval for this project was obtained by PHE Porton down, and as no patient samples were utilised, consent was not required. Viral inactivation was performed using AVL buffer (Qiagen) and 5% Triton-X100.Pre-clinical evaluation of candidate LFDs was performed by trained laboratory scientists at Public Health England (PHE) Porton Down.

        <p>Results were recorded as positive, negative or void with no possibility of recording indeterminate results. Pre-defined and publicly available "prioritisation" criteria to pass on to the next evaluation phase had to be met for LFDs, consisting of (i) a kit failure rate of &lt;10%; (ii) an analytical specificity of 97%, and (iii) an analytical LOD of 9 of 15 (60%) at 10 2 pfu/mL (plaque forming units per millilitre), corresponding to a RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) of approximately 25 (~100,000 RNA copies/ml); and (iv) lack of cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses to further test analytical specificity [16].Results were recorded as positive, negative or void with no possibility of recording indeterminate results.

        <p>Evaluation using patient samples retrospectively was started in August 2020 at PHE Porton Down. Institutional ethical assessment and approval for this project was obtained from the University of Oxford. Surplus samples were used anonymously as an audit of COVID-19 tests and enabled evaluation without express consent from individuals. Samples were obtained from a secondary healthcare setting (Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust). Samples were analysed against RT-PCR to determine false positives and negatives (see supplementary methods). 1000 SARS-CoV-2 negative samples: fresh swabs samples in VTM held at 4oC were supplied the day after they were tested negative by RT-PCR by the laboratory service at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. 200 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples: swabs collected in VTM from patients admitted to hospital during the first wave of the UK pandemic (March-June 2020) [17]. These swabs generally consisted of MWE microbiology transport swabs. These were diluted 1:4 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative saliva, aliquoted and frozen at À20 °C for later use. For each positive sample, in addition to the original diagnostic RT-PCR Ct value, a confirmatory RT-PCR was performed at PHE Porton Down on the diluted sample to determine the new Ct value.Evaluation using patient samples retrospectively was started in August 2020 at PHE Porton Down.

        <p>Evidence before this study Lateral flow devices are a new form of testing for SARS-CoV-2. They differ from RT-PCR tests in that they rely on the detection of viral antigens by immunoassays and their utility has not yet been fully defined. A literature review was performed in PubMed and bioRxiv/medRxiv for all studies using lateral flow devices for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen. This used the search terms "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "viral antigen" and "lateral flow devices" and was not limited to English language publications. To date, the majority of studies have been largely single centre studies analysing a single test and there are contrasting results with some LFDs showing good sensitivity and specificity, and others demonstrating poorer performance.Evidence before this study Lateral flow devices are a new form of testing for SARS-CoV-2.

        <p>This UK COVID-19 Lateral Flow Oversight group study is the largest national evaluation undertaken of viral antigen LFDs for COVID-19. We have flagged four LFDs with the best performance characteristics from our assessments. The Innova LFD has been tested the most extensively and has high specificity with acceptable sensitivity. Our data has also highlighted the critical importance of training. We also note the need for further clinical studies to demonstrate that the identification of individuals with higher viral loads will be of benefit in interrupting transmission.This UK COVID-19 Lateral Flow Oversight group study is the largest national evaluation undertaken of viral antigen LFDs for COVID-19.

        <p>Our data indicates that LFDs for COVID-19 have performance characteristics attractive for the UK mass testing program. Ongoing iterative evaluation of the population-level roll-out of LFDs in reducing transmission of COVID-19, and the contribution of such tests to reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality for clinically vulnerable individuals, is desirable. Further work is required to determine the amount and content of "training" to derive optimal test performance. We undertook a field evaluation using samples from volunteers in the community in collaboration with the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded CONDOR Platform "COVID-19 National Diagnostic Research and Evaluation Platform". This was performed under ethical approval obtained from the FALCONÀ ÀC19 study (Facilitating Accelerated Clinical Validation Of Novel diagnostics for COVID-19, 20/WA/0169, IRAS 284,229. All individuals gave expressed consent for use of their data.). The study was conducted between 17th September and 23rd October 2020. This involved the recruitment and re-testing of a consecutive series of consenting adults with a RT-PCRconfirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 5 days of the original PCR result. LFD testing was performed at PHE Porton Down with the operators being unaware of clinical information from the study participants.Our data indicates that LFDs for COVID-19 have performance characteristics attractive for the UK mass testing program.

Performance was optimal when the LFD was used by laboratory scientists (156/198 LFDs positive [78.8%, 95% CI: 72.4À84.3%]) relative to trained healthcare-workers (156/223 LFDs positive [70.0%, 95% CI: 63.5À75.9%]) and self-trained members of the public given a protocol (214/372 LFDs positive [57.5%, 95% CI: 52.3À62.6%]; p&lt;0.0001) (Fig. 2).As part of Phase 3b-4 evaluations, work was performed to report on the effect of the operator on viral antigen detection/sensitivity in RT-PCR-positive cases using the Innova LFD.

        <p>We report on our national evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigendetecting LFDs, focussing on the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test, which has a viral antigen detection (sensitivity) of 78.8% when performed by laboratory scientists and a specificity of 99.7%, using RT-PCR as 'gold standard' for positive and negative status. Test performance to detect SARS-CoV-2-positive samples was improved at lower Ct values/higher viral loads, and were &gt;90% at Ct values &lt;25 (equating to ~390 pfu/mL, 100,000 RNA copies/ml). We are not able to comment on whether there is a concentration of viral load where LFDs become more sensitive than PCR and further work is required on the precise lower bound of detection using a greater number of samples. However, there is an expanding body of evidence that suggests viral load/antigen is important as individuals with the highest viral loads are the most infectious, [20] and the presence/ absence of viral antigens determined by LFDs is more strongly associated with a viral culture than RT-PCR positivity [21]. In our evaluation, test performance was largely maintained across different settings and cohorts; however, performance was partly operatordependent and kit failures are not infrequent.We report on our national evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigendetecting LFDs, focussing on the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test, which has a viral antigen detection (sensitivity) of 78.8% when performed by laboratory scientists and a specificity of 99.7%, using RT-PCR as 'gold standard' for positive and negative status.

        <p>Our experience is that many LFDs entering our national evaluation program do not perform at a level required for mass population deployment and this reflects the literature. To date, an increasing number of evaluations of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting LFD have been published with variable results. A number of LFDs show good, [22,23,13,19,24,25] or acceptable sensitivity and specificity, [26,27] however, many studies have identified tests with poor sensitivities or specificities [28,15].Our experience is that many LFDs entering our national evaluation program do not perform at a level required for mass population deployment and this reflects the literature.

        <p>A challenge for most countries during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been the expansion of capacity for diagnostic testing to support the identification of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. This would aid in offering testing to "contacts" of COVID-19 and enable targeted testing to better safeguard vulnerable populations e.g. care home residents. Reliance on RT-PCR involves significant infrastructural and specialist human resources to implement at increasing scale. Both the World Health Organisation and European commission have issued guidance supporting wider implementation of antigentargeting LFDs, and in November, Slovakia became the first country in the world to implement entire population testing using LFDs [1,3,29]. The UK has similar aspirations to pursue a strategy of mass testing and has implemented a city wide mass testing in Liverpool using the Innova LFD in this study [30].A challenge for most countries during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been the expansion of capacity for diagnostic testing to support the identification of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.

        <p>It is important to note that there are some potential issues with considering RT-PCR as the gold standard test for COVID-19. Many individuals have persisting viral RNA fragments that can linger for weeks-months without any evidence of active viral replication; in this instance a PCR-positive is likely to overcall the "infectious" status of an individual [31]. Indeed, when compared to the ability to perform viral culture, data suggest that RT-PCR tends to overestimate the presence of replicating or infectious virions. [32].It is important to note that there are some potential issues with considering RT-PCR as the gold standard test for COVID-19.

        <p>In field testing, performance of the Innova LFD was dependent on the test operator. Individuals who had read a protocol immediately prior to self-sampling did not perform as well as individuals with hands-on training, or clinical laboratory personnel who had performed several hundred LFD tests. Optimal test performance, is therefore likely to reflect the ability of operators to perform the test according to the manufacturer's instructions in the field. In a hospital staff testing setting, recently published work confirmed good performance of these tests for home-testing [33]. It is assumed that the use of LFDs to successfully identify individuals with higher viral loads and enabling an earlier diagnosis will be of benefit in interrupting transmission. However, like any new test, the magnitude of benefit versus potential for theoretical harm in different settings will need to be ascertained and has caused ongoing debate in the academic community [ 34 35]. SARS-CoV-2 control will benefit from a variety of testing strategies. This might include those optimised for determining past infection/exposure (e.g. serology), those that are of benefit in determining current/recent infection (e.g. RT-PCR), or those identifying potential infectivity. A combination of approaches incorporating the strengths of each of these tests can be effectively used for individuals and for population-level management of the pandemic. Based on our analyses we do believe there is a role for LFDs in clinical use using the 4 LFDs identified. We do not believe comparisons between these LFDs is appropriate in this dataset as there are slight difference in both the viral load bands and number of tests performed. Approaches to testing will remain relevant even when effective vaccines become available as it may take several months for an appreciable effect on transmission to be fully realised [36].In field testing, performance of the Innova LFD was dependent on the test operator.

        <p>In conclusion, we completed late stage evaluations of seven LFDs. We report sensitivities of 70À80% and specificities 99.7% for each LFD evaluated in phase 3b, which involved testing by laboratory personnel or trained healthcare professionals. To identify patients with higher viral loads (Ct&lt;25), each LFD had &gt;90% sensitivity. Sensitivity was lower in phase 4 evaluations, while specificity was maintained. The simplicity of LFDs, without a requirement for specialist training or equipment, mean that they are an attractive option for mass testing. Future research should focus on post-implementation evaluation of diagnostic accuracy and strategies to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of these tests. This will include the potential benefits of regular serial sampling, digital results interpretation and incorporation of enhanced training strategies utilising videos to improve accuracy and reduce transmission.In conclusion, we completed late stage evaluations of seven LFDs.
