        <p>The 
            <rs type="software">FactSage</rs> computer package consists of a series of information, calculation and manipulation modules that enable one to access and manipulate compound and solution databases. With the various modules running under 
            <rs type="creator">Microsoft</rs>
            <rs type="software">Windows</rs> s one can perform a wide variety of thermochemical calculations and generate tables, graphs and figures of interest to chemical and physical metallurgists, chemical engineers, corrosion engineers, inorganic chemists, geochemists, ceramists, electrochemists, environmentalists, etc. This paper presents a summary of the developments in the 
            <rs type="software">FactSage</rs> thermochemical software and databases during the last six years. Particular emphasis is placed on the new databases and developments in calculating and manipulating phase diagrams.
        </p>
        <p>FactSage began in 1976 as F*A*C*T -Facility for the Analysis of Chemical Thermodynamicsa joint research project between McGill University and École Polytechnique de Montréal (Université de Montréal Campus). In 1984 the CRCT -Centre for Research in Computational Thermochemistry/Centre de Recherche en Calcul Thermochimiquewas founded at École Polytechnique de Montréal. A principal activity of the CRCT was, and still remains, the promotion and development of the F*A*C*T thermochemical databases and software.FactSage began in 1976 as F*A*C*T -Facility for the Analysis of Chemical Thermodynamicsa joint research project between McGill University and École Polytechnique de Montréal (Université de Montréal Campus).

A principal activity of the CRCT was, and still remains, the promotion and development of the F*A*C*T thermochemical databases and software.</p>
        <p>During the 1990s F*A*C*T migrated to personal computers running in a Windows environment. In 2001 there was a fusion between F*A*C*T / FACT-Win and 
            <rs type="software">ChemSage</rs> (formerly 
            <rs type="software">SOLGASMIX</rs> [1]) resulting in FactSage s . Since then 
            <rs type="software">FactSage</rs> has expanded into a fully integrated thermochemical software and database package that is used worldwide at over 800 sites in universities, governmental and nongovernmental research laboratories and industry.
        </p>
        <p>The original 
            <rs type="software">F*A*C*T</rs> package was designed to simulate the thermochemistry of pyrometallurgical processing and plot classical binary and ternary phase diagrams. Today FactSage applications include hydrometallurgy, electrometallurgy, corrosion, glass technology, combustion, ceramics, geology, environmental studies, etc. and it can calculate and plot binary, ternary and multicomponent phase diagrams with a wide variety of axes. Forty years ago the turnaround time using a mainframe computer to calculate and print thermochemical tables was measured in hours. Using today's personal computers one can calculate and plot phase diagrams within seconds.

        <p>While an understanding of chemical thermodynamics is useful in order to run the modules, it is not essential for a user to be an expert in the field. With practice and the assistance of extensive documentation, one can acquire a practical understanding of the principles of thermochemistry, especially as these relate to complex phase equilibria. Articles on FactSage Thermochemical Software and Databases (2002) and FactSage Thermochemical Software and Databases -Recent Developments (2009) have been published in the Calphad Journal [2,3]. The reader who is unfamiliar with FactSage is encouraged to consult these original publications. The present article outlines the new databases and developments in calculating and manipulating phase diagrams that have been introduced since the last publication (2009) and briefly describes developments in the programs.While an understanding of chemical thermodynamics is useful in order to run the modules, it is not essential for a user to be an expert in the field.

In particular, the liquid "Slag" phase is treated as a single solution phase containing all 10 elements, valid at all temperatures and over all composition ranges of interest. This phase thus incorporates the high-temperature oxycarbide slag, sulfide-rich liquid and oxide slags which might appear at lower temperatures, oxynitride liquids, etc., all in one solution (with possible miscibility gaps, of course).

        <p>This is necessary to ensure the tie-lines are straight lines. A new feature in Phase Diagram permits the user to select the reciprocal phase diagram option and then enter the cationic and anionic components (Fig. 24). This results in the calculation of a polythermal projection (Fig. 25) which is labeled with the pertinent information associated with the reciprocal system.This is necessary to ensure the tie-lines are straight lines.

        <p>Volume or log volume may be specified as an X-or Y-axis. Typical volume diagrams include V (or log V) vs. T and V ( or log V) vs. X.

        <p>The first-melting projection of the phase diagram of a ternary or higher-order system shows the temperature at which a liquid phase first appears upon heating at any given composition in a system at thermodynamic equilibrium. In most systems, firstmelting projections are identical to solidus projections and they obey the same well-known topological rules as isothermal sections of phase diagrams. Hence, their interpretation is straightforward. Only in systems with catatectic invariants or retrograde solid solubility do exceptions to these rules occur, and then only over limited composition regions. For more details on the algorithm and explanations refer to [23]. For example, Fig. 27 shows a polythermal first-melting (solidus) projection in the ternary Zn-Mg-Al system; Fig. 28 shows a polythermal first-melting (solidus) projection in the quaternary system Zn-Mg-Al-Y. 6.6. Paraequilibrium phase diagram [24] Paraequilibrium refers to the concept that diffusion of interstitial solutes is much faster than that of substitutional atoms. For example, in the Fe-Cr-C-N system carbon and nitrogen diffuse much more rapidly than Fe and Cr. That is, the diffusion of Fe and Cr during relatively rapid cooling can be ignored.The first-melting projection of the phase diagram of a ternary or higher-order system shows the temperature at which a liquid phase first appears upon heating at any given composition in a system at thermodynamic equilibrium.

        <p>It is also possible to calculate phase diagrams in which the phase fields show the single phase with the minimum Gibbs energy at any given point on the diagram as shown in Fig. 32. Such calculations may be of practical interest in physical vapour deposition where deposition from the vapour phase is so rapid that phase separation cannot occur, resulting in a single-phase solid deposit.It is also possible to calculate phase diagrams in which the phase fields show the single phase with the minimum Gibbs energy at any given point on the diagram as shown in Fig. 32.

        <p>On a calculated phase diagram it is now possible to plot isobars of a gaseous species or gas phase and iso-activity lines of a compound (pure liquid or solid). For compound species, isobars and iso-activity lines are defined in the Compound Selection Window as shown in Fig. 33. The resulting diagram (Fig. 34) shows the calculated O 2 (g) isobars in the Cu-O binary system using data from the FScopp database.

        <p>The basic principles behind the calculation of isobars and isoactivity lines have been discussed by [25]. It involves the introduction of an auxiliary phase, and its Gibbs energy function is manipulated in order to plot a specific iso-line as if it were a pseudo-phase boundary (as a zero-phase-fraction-line) of this auxiliary phase. This approach can be extended to calculate other iso-lines for other properties (activity coefficients, sulfide capacities, surface tension, etc.) For example, Fig. 37 [26] shows calculated iso-sulfide capacity (C S ) lines of CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 slags at 1400 °C and the calculated liquidus (thin lines).The basic principles behind the calculation of isobars and isoactivity lines have been discussed by [25].

        <p>It is should be noted that the Phase Diagram module requires no starting values or initial estimates. All phase diagrams shown here were calculated and plotted by simply selecting "Calculate 4 4". In some cases text and labels were manually added for clarity.It is should be noted that the Phase Diagram module requires no starting values or initial estimates.
