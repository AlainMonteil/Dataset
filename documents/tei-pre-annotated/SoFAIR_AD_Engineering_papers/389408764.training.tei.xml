        <p>The transition towards a decarbonized and sustainable energy system is expected to play a crucial role in halting the effects of global warming while furthering human wellbeing, security, and sustainable development [1]. Energy system models -mathematical representations of energy systems -are often needed to quantify the impacts of this transition, and plan potential pathways [2,3] due to increasing complexity. Numerous energy system modelling tools 1 are available, providing energy modelling practitioners and planners with a wide range of alternatives to represent energy systems according to different technical and methodological considerations, which can help inform policy-and decision-makers in their planning processes and policy recommendations [4,5]. These tools are in continuous development in response to the emerging challenges in the energy transition and new technological breakthroughs [3,5]. For this reason, multiple efforts have been made in the energy modelling community to review the everchanging pool of tools available to energy modellers, to classify their features, outline their applications, and point at the issues that these aim to tackle [4,[6][7][8].The transition towards a decarbonized and sustainable energy system is expected to play a crucial role in halting the effects of global warming while furthering human wellbeing, security, and sustainable development [1].

        <p>In this paper, we survey how these reviews have been conducted and what issues they address. Moreover, we show current trends found in energy system modelling tools by gathering some of their key features and applications, including their apparent role in decision-making support. To do this effectively, we have gathered inputs from tool developers to better assess some of the key considerations and to gather information that is not necessarily readily available from written academic sources or tool documentation.In this paper, we survey how these reviews have been conducted and what issues they address.

        <p>Energy system modelling tools are used for assisting energy policy making and assessing different energy pathways [9]. The range of available energy modelling tools is significant and continuously expanding. Several studies have investigated the developments of the above with a focus on different aspects of these models and reported different challenges faced in the field of energy systems analysis. For instance, Connolly et al. [4] present an overview of computational modelling tools capable of analyzing the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in energy systems at large, looking into survey responses from 37 model developers.Energy system modelling tools are used for assisting energy policy making and assessing different energy pathways [9].

        <p>In Foley et al. [10], a literature review of system models with a focus only on the electricity sector is presented. Similarly, Després et al. [11] conduct a review of modelling tools focusing on the integration of variable renewable energy (VRE) mainly in the power sector. Mahmud and Town [12] reviewed modelling tools with a focus on the integration of electric vehicles in the energy system. More recently, in a study by Ringkjøb et al. [6], a thorough review of 75 energy and electricity system modelling tools is presented, assessing modelling scopes, characteristics and limitations, and validating most inputs with tool developers.In Foley et al.

        <p>In addition to these broader overviews of energy system modelling tools, a relevant body of work exists about the underlying implications that models have on a broader energy planning level. In this regard, a key aspect to consider is the classification of the energy system model, and the choice of specific types of modelling frameworks according to the purpose of a given planning exercise.In addition to these broader overviews of energy system modelling tools, a relevant body of work exists about the underlying implications that models have on a broader energy planning level.

        <p>Different classifications of energy system modelling tools have been discussed by a number of studies, which reflect upon the characteristics and challenges of bottom-up applications [8], the suitability of tools for decision support in local planning [13], as well as their applicability worldwide [14], their general effectiveness for energy planning purposes [15], their level of technical complexity [16], and the classification of modelling approaches with direct feedback from modelling tool developers [17].Different classifications of energy system modelling tools have been discussed by a number of studies, which reflect upon the characteristics and challenges of bottom-up applications [8], the suitability of tools for decision support in local planning [13], as well as their applicability worldwide [14], their general effectiveness for energy planning purposes [15], their level of technical complexity [16], and the classification of modelling approaches with direct feedback from modelling tool developers [17].</p>
        <p>Another critical consideration examined in the literature is the applicability of models in specific context-areas. This has been the case, for instance, in reviewing and narrowing down the applicability of various energy system modelling tools and their limitations for analyzing the energy transition in a European context [18], in a regional Nordic perspective [19], on a country-specific level [20,21], in developing world countries [22,23], in energy systems of urban scale [24][25][26][27][28][29], and standalone and grid-connected hybrid energy systems [30,31].Another critical consideration examined in the literature is the applicability of models in specific context-areas.

        <p>Over the past years, a number of studies have shifted the spotlight from a pure overview of modelling tools towards the study of emerging issues for energy system modellers and planners, as developers and users of such tools, under the context of climate change and the transition towards sustainable energy systems. For example, Pfenninger et al. [5] outline different modelling paradigms and emerging methodological challenges faced in the energy system modelling arena, highlighting the way current modelling methods could be revised by benefiting from cross-discipline and cross-sectoral synergies.Over the past years, a number of studies have shifted the spotlight from a pure overview of modelling tools towards the study of emerging issues for energy system modellers and planners, as developers and users of such tools, under the context of climate change and the transition towards sustainable energy systems.

        <p>Similarly, Lund et al. [32] put into perspective the theoretical positioning with regards to selecting a modelling approach and how these should be considered when addressing and debating different future energy system scenarios based on sector integration.Similarly, Lund et al.

        <p>Correspondingly, the complementarity of these modelling paradigms and approaches, and the potential to integrate models with different features for answering emerging research questions has also been a matter of recent study [33][34][35], as the focus towards more cross-sectoral integration [12,[36][37][38] and socio-technical considerations becomes more apparent [39][40][41][42][43].Correspondingly, the complementarity of these modelling paradigms and approaches, and the potential to integrate models with different features for answering emerging research questions has also been a matter of recent study [33][34][35], as the focus towards more cross-sectoral integration [12,[36][37][38] and socio-technical considerations becomes more apparent [39][40][41][42][43].</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Savvidis et al. [7] review and discuss the gaps between energy policy questions and modelling capabilities found in a selected sample of modelling tools. In addition to these, the openness of energy data and models have been discussed in a number of studies [44][45][46][47][48] and by expert groups. These include the Open Energy Modelling Initiative [45,49], which collects information on a growing number of opensource energy system models and frameworks in addition to open energy data; and combined efforts in the modelling community like the Energy Modelling Platform for Europe and other energy system modelling related projects [50][51][52][53][54][55].Meanwhile, Savvidis et al.

        <p>However, some key gaps remain present. As pointed out by Hall and Buckley [20], the lack of clarity found in the literature about models' characteristics can hinder side-to-side comparisons. Moreover, the target audience and the main area of application of these modelling tools are not always explicit in the literature, often leaving these aspects open to interpretation [25]. Furthermore, potential misinterpretations or misrepresentations while reviewing modelling tools can arise if no form of dialogue with developers take place. Taking as an example the EnergyPLAN tool as portrayed in recent literature review studies, the tool is described as having an optimization methodology [56], geographical coverage [8] and being developed in a programming language [21] which do not necessarily correspond to the tool as described by its developers [57]. Thus, having open lines of dialogue, such as surveys and personal communication, can be a valuable approach when reviewing and validating the technical characteristics of modelling tools, as has been shown in past studies [4,6,16,17].However, some key gaps remain present.

        <p>Nonetheless, this more direct review approach has had limited use when probing aspects such as the policy relevance of the tools, the ability to couple multiple modelling tools to answer complex research questions, or the level of accessibility of the tools with a perspective on not only the licensing but also on the user interaction. This becomes especially crucial as the value of modelling tools and scenarios for decision support is not always fully appreciated by energy planning practitioners and decision-makers [58], despite the intent of models and tools to be relevant for decision-support [59].Nonetheless, this more direct review approach has had limited use when probing aspects such as the policy relevance of the tools, the ability to couple multiple modelling tools to answer complex research questions, or the level of accessibility of the tools with a perspective on not only the licensing but also on the user interaction.

        <p>As described in the previous section, the current landscape of reviews assessing energy system modelling tools is quite vast. To better understand how these studies have been conducted and their focus areas, we have put forth a classification scheme of these reviews. This classification scheme also has the purpose of outlining new potential focus areas to survey modelling tools, and potential areas of actionable research. At the same time, it provides a useful view into past research that has listed some existing modelling tools, including their attributes and applications.As described in the previous section, the current landscape of reviews assessing energy system modelling tools is quite vast.

        <p>For this, we have used a modified and expanded categorization scheme compared to that initially proposed by Savvidis et al.

        <p>In the present study, we reformulate the four original categories with additional details and propose three new additional categories based on recurring themes found in previous literature but not explicitly mentioned in the previous categorization effort. Namely, these new categories cover reviews that examine real-life policy application of the tools, model linking, and the transparency, accessibility and usability of the tools. In addition to this, we contextualize these studies in terms of their review approach, as well as their area of application and delimiting scope. This allows identifying existing trends and new potential study areas while putting in perspective how modelling lessons are gathered, and how future review exercises can potentially be conducted.In the present study, we reformulate the four original categories with additional details and propose three new additional categories based on recurring themes found in previous literature but not explicitly mentioned in the previous categorization effort.

        <p>In this paper, the categories considered are divided as follows, considering their corresponding purpose(s):In this paper, the categories considered are divided as follows, considering their corresponding purpose(s):</p>
        <p>• Category 1 [Descriptive overview]: Provide descriptive overviews of the technical features of modelling tools, such as their methodological approach, mathematical formulation, and resolution (spatial, temporal, techno-economic, sectoral). It is apparent that these categories are not mutually exclusive. In fact, most reviews fell into more than one single category. It is also important to note that there is a degree of overlap between the categories, where some elements of one category could be sub-categorized within another due to some of the studies having more general purposes. However, a degree of differentiation is needed to zero in on the key issues and insights contributed by the reviewed literature. For instance, when considering reviews of the modelling tools' practical application (category 3), an overlap with potentially reviewing their suitability to access policy applications. However, the latter warrants deeper analysis to determine actionable research and real-life application of the reviewed tools, as conveyed by Category 6.• Category 1 [Descriptive overview]: Provide descriptive overviews of the technical features of modelling tools, such as their methodological approach, mathematical formulation, and resolution (spatial, temporal, techno-economic, sectoral).

        <p>In addition to these categories, we have categorized the reviews by their focus area and delimitating scope, by outlining whether the reviews focused onfor exampleurban scale modelling tools, power sector models, bottom-up tools, socio-technical energy transition (STET) models, etc. Similarly, the review approach was also outlined. Here, we noted three distinct approaches: literature reviews, reviews with developer/user inputs (from survey questionnaires, presentations, or review validation with tool developers), and web searches. Concretely for the last approach, the review paper by Markovic et al. [24], presented results without further procedural description and solely referencing websites.In addition to these categories, we have categorized the reviews by their focus area and delimitating scope, by outlining whether the reviews focused onfor exampleurban scale modelling tools, power sector models, bottom-up tools, socio-technical energy transition (STET) models, etc. Similarly, the review approach was also outlined.

        <p>A summary of the categorization, focus and approach of the reviews is seen in Table 1.A summary of the categorization, focus and approach of the reviews is seen in Table 1.</p>
        <p>As observed in Table 1, several purposes can be identified in previous review studies of energy system models and tools. This survey shows that a clear majority of the studies provide some type of descriptive overview (Category 1) of the features found in models and tools, while also providing classification schemes (Category 2) or prescriptive narrowed-down lists of tools suitable to address a specific issue or scope of analyses. In general, these reviews are useful at mapping the technical aspects and considerations for modellers to select a tool and to pinpoint issues within specific modelling approaches. This is especially the case when these tools are assessed in tandem with applied case studies, where their application provides further insight into how the tools are able to tackle questions about the energy system and different energy policy scenarios.As observed in Table 1, several purposes can be identified in previous review studies of energy system models and tools.

        <p>Although dialogue with tools developers is often suggested by a number of reviews to improve clarity on modelling purpose and scope, assumptions and categorizations; the reviews are not always conducted in such ways. Instead, as seen in Table 1, most of these studies rely on reviewing the existing literature to formulate their interpretation of modelling features or to assess the applicability of models or their policy-relevance.Although dialogue with tools developers is often suggested by a number of reviews to improve clarity on modelling purpose and scope, assumptions and categorizations; the reviews are not always conducted in such ways.

        <p>In more recent years, the issues of transparency and model accessibility have come into focus, being key issues covered by a growing number of studies. This often refers to having open access to a model or to a modelling framework's underlying mathematical formulation -i.e. making the underlying software code in some tools being open source. However, the broader accessibility of the tools in terms of the readiness with which end-users can use tools to construct an energy system model and generate energy system scenarios is not commonly evaluated in previous studies.In more recent years, the issues of transparency and model accessibility have come into focus, being key issues covered by a growing number of studies.

        <p>Moreover, from this survey we have seen that the policy relevance of the modelling tools is often evaluated in terms of the tool's capabilities to assess the impacts of current policy and potential future developments in academic studies. Given the technical features found in the current landscape of modelling tools, evaluating techno-economic aspects of policy implementations could be routinely performed. However, the focus has been more limited in terms of reviewing the tools used for official policy-makingincluding both whether the tools have been used directly or as a reference to support official policy choices and their subsequent impact on official planning and decision-making processes. Finding out about these types of applications requires going beyond the tools' technical documentation, and sometimes even beyond written academic outlets. While, this information might be available in official documents, it becomes increasingly complicated to compile when considering the multitude of national, regional and local official plans (often only published in their local language) documenting the use of analysis of policy relevant questions, the actual use of these to support official policy is more limited. Here, we refer to reviews that follow up on whether the modelling tools have been used to support official (government) policy, rather than their ability to technically evaluate policy and generate insights solely on an academic level. energy system modelling tools. Finally, another recurring area suggested in the surveyed review articles is the application of interdisciplinary approaches, and model coordination and integration. However, few reviews try to map how tools have been coupled together beyond a specific set of modelling traditions [34]. This opens questions as to how model coupling is done, with which tools, and to what extent coupling approaches are used to answer specific energy planning questions.Moreover, from this survey we have seen that the policy relevance of the modelling tools is often evaluated in terms of the tool's capabilities to assess the impacts of current policy and potential future developments in academic studies.

        <p>Looking beyond the scope and methodologies of past reviews listed in Table 1, several trends and findings emerge from the literature over the past 10 years. In Connolly et al. [4], the typical application of different modelling tools is provided. While this study has a comparative nature, it outlines thatat the timeonly seven energy system modelling tools were identified capable of modelling 100% renewable energy systems, four considering hourly time-steps and different sector coverage, and three with coarser (annual) temporal resolutions but with multi-year perspectives.Looking beyond the scope and methodologies of past reviews listed in Table 1, several trends and findings emerge from the literature over the past 10 years.

        <p>From there, several suitability studies have looked further into the technical descriptions of different energy modelling tools, having as main outcome shortlists of applicable tools that could address specific research cases. This has been predominantly the case of reviews looking into the suitability of energy system modelling tools to represent local scale energy systems (ie. Urban, district, community scale), though similar cases apply for other geographical scales. As early examples, Mendes et al. [61] identify a handful of tools highlighting the importance of hourly modelling and spatial scale flexibility to conduct their assessment; while Allegrini et al. [26] call for adequate representation of district heating, renewable energy and adequate integration of the urban microclimate and resulting effects on building demands when conducting energy system analyses. By contrast, studies conducted over the past 5 years incorporate into their model-finding exercises far more comprehensive criteria about high modelling details such as multiple sector representation, high spatial and temporal resolutions, uncertainty analysis, storage and demand side management representation [29,36,67]; but also user-friendliness [28] and openness of these tools [56]. Meanwhile, other studies point at a lack of representation of additional dimensions, like increased social aspects in energy system modelling tools [31].From there, several suitability studies have looked further into the technical descriptions of different energy modelling tools, having as main outcome shortlists of applicable tools that could address specific research cases.

        <p>Similar to Connolly et al. a decade ago, Foley et al. [10] also raised the issue of modelling renewable energy, finding that electricity system models were ill suited to properly consider energy storages, flexibility services and variable renewable energy sources. More recently, Ringkjøb et al. [6] found that several studies address the effects of integrating variable renewable energy sources to varying degrees, with models capable of representing grid expansion, storages and demand-side management technologies. However, representing the variability of these sources in long-term energy models was found as a challenge due to the coarser time-step of these modelling tools. Likewise, the integration of energy sectors was also found as an outstanding challenge to be address in model development. Prina et al. [8] also makes this point, after identifying the current status of bottom-up models in their spatial, temporal, techno-economic and sectoral resolutions. In their study, bottom-up modelling tools are found uncapable of addressing these four dimensions fully.Similar to Connolly et al. a decade ago, Foley et al. [10] also raised the issue of modelling renewable energy, finding that electricity system models were ill suited to properly consider energy storages, flexibility services and variable renewable energy sources. More recently, Ringkjøb et al. [6] found that several studies address the effects of integrating variable renewable energy sources to varying degrees, with models capable of representing grid expansion, storages and demand-side management technologies. However, representing the variability of these sources in long-term energy models was found as a challenge due to the coarser time-step of these modelling tools. Likewise, the integration of energy sectors was also found as an outstanding challenge to be address in model development. Prina et al. [8] also makes this point, after identifying the current status of bottom-up models in their spatial, temporal, techno-economic and sectoral resolutions.

        <p>Similarly, in Lopion et al. [21], key trends are also examined around the development of energy system models over the last decades. In this review, they found new developments around increasing spatial and temporal flexibility of energy system models and state the need to have modelling efforts align to answering energy policy questions. This is also touched upon by Savvidis et al. [7], when reviewing gaps between modelling capabilities and technology-specific policies. From this study, the representation of the distribution grids, endogenous demands, the systems technical flexibility and policy constraints were found as areas of improvement for energy system models.Similarly, in Lopion et al.

        <p>Other key areas found among recent reviews, include the prospect of expanding modelling dimensions to increase realism in addressing energy and climate challenges, and increasing modelling transparency. In the case of the former, linking energy system modelling tools with sociotechnical energy transition approaches [34] or macro-economic models [33] has been found as a potential avenue for inter-disciplinarity and better representation of the energy system. Fattahi et al. [35], also highlights this potential, after noting the shortcoming of energy system modelling tools in generating insight about micro-and macro-economic aspects of the energy transition.Other key areas found among recent reviews, include the prospect of expanding modelling dimensions to increase realism in addressing energy and climate challenges, and increasing modelling transparency.

        <p>On the issue of transparency, much has been said in recent years. For instance, Morrison [46] and Pfenninger et al. [45] find that energy system models are lagging behind in adopting best practices for transparency, such as those found in the open modelling community, pointing out the need to enhance transparency of modelling analysis and reproducibility. Following from this, Oberle and Elsland [47] look into the current landscape of open access tools to outline their features, finding them technically suitable to address research questions regarding a variety of energy scenarios.On the issue of transparency, much has been said in recent years.

        <p>In this paper, we opted to review the features and applicability of energy system modelling tools by gathering inputs directly from tool development teams and key users. As seen in the literature review, some aspects of the tools and their applications can be overlooked, are rather difficult to come by from only analyzing publications or are altogether misinterpreted due to a lack of a common language found in the existing literature describing modelling tools. This becomes increasingly relevant when considering the application of some modelling tools outside the realms of academia, where modelling outputs can translate into local or national policy discussion in white or green papers (sometimes in their original language), while being less accessible to external inspection or by reviewing traditional sources and model documentation.In this paper, we opted to review the features and applicability of energy system modelling tools by gathering inputs directly from tool development teams and key users.

        <p>In this process, 137 different modelling tools were identified from the existing literature and survey studies referenced in the previous section. The conceptualization of the questionnaire took the work presented in Connolly et al. [4] as a starting point of inspiration, with several reconsiderations and new aspects added to the questionnaire presented in that study corresponding to new developments and considerations in the practice of energy system modelling and tool development.In this process, 137 different modelling tools were identified from the existing literature and survey studies referenced in the previous section.

        <p>From this survey, 54 complete responses where gathered, plus an additional six partially completed entries. Although, additional tools and model descriptions can be found in the literature, these are not considered in the following result interpretation in order to preserve the consistency of the analysis. It must be noted that the overall survey results, while not necessarily providing a comprehensive sample of all existing tools, are still indicative of general trends found in the energy system modelling field. The tools covered in the analysis ranged from commercially available software, to in-house proprietary developments, and open access, widely used modelling tools. In addition, a deliberate choice was made to only include one modelling tool in cases where multiple branch-out versions exist; for example, in the case of MARKAL-TIMES [69], and its family of models [70][71][72][73][74], or similarly in the case of 
            <rs type="software">OSeMOSYS</rs> [75] and 
            <rs type="software">GENeSYS-MOD</rs> [76]. The list of tools surveyed is presented in Table 2.

        <p>As identified in the literature, several schemes exist to classify modelling tools according to their methodological approach and mathematical formulation [13,17,20,129]. In this study we examined the modelling tools under three broad categories according to their analytical approach: Simulation, Optimization and Equilibrium models. In the case of the latter, further subcategorizations were defined by model developers about their modelling tools, namely to clarify if these are computable general equilibrium (CGE) or partial equilibrium. In addition to the above, some simulation tools made further specifications to describe the novelty of their underlying methodology; for instance, by elaborating on their operation and iterative simulation approach [107].As identified in the literature, several schemes exist to classify modelling tools according to their methodological approach and mathematical formulation [13,17,20,129].

        <p>In terms of the mathematical formulation, several objectives were identified across the sampled energy system modelling tools. More recurring across optimization modelling tools was the characterization of one or more purpose-fit objective functions, including the minimization or maximization of indicators such as total system costs, investment costs, dispatch costs, fuel consumption, system emissions, renewable energy penetration, and social welfare. In the case of simulation tools, the main approaches identified behind their mathematical formulation included scenario development, what-if analysis, multicriteria analysis and agent-based analysis.In terms of the mathematical formulation, several objectives were identified across the sampled energy system modelling tools.

        <p>Irrespective of modelling approach and formulation, the definition of multiple objectives or purposes for a given single tool was readily apparent from the gathered data, as is the fact that a significant portion of the models can serve multiple purposes with their underlying formulation.

        <p>In the modelling tools sampled for this study, the 1-hour modelling time-step was the most frequently observed, as seen in Fig. 1. Other time-steps observed, although to a lesser extent, were the yearly and multi-year resolutions, as well as seasonal time-slices. In the "Other" category, the modelling tools were reported capable of adjusting their modelling time-step to even higher levels like minutes, seconds, or having user-defined steps, as well as having lower resolutions e.g. daily, using representative hours and hour-blocks and weekly resolutions. In addition, some tools had higher (hourly) resolutions in certain aspects of their system representation while using coarser (annual) resolutions for others.In the modelling tools sampled for this study, the 1-hour modelling time-step was the most frequently observed, as seen in Fig. 1.

        <p>Interestingly, modelling tool developers also highlighted that the capabilities of their models not always correspond to their typical application. For example, some tools although technically capable of operating with an hourly resolution, are typically used with other modelling time-steps, such as using a time-slice representation [69] or with a reduced yearly time-series produced from aggregation algorithms [76]. For some tools, this can be explained by the fact that high modelling resolutions and temporal detail can translate to higher computational effort and calculation times [5]. However, the choice of lower time resolutions can also driven by a lack of empirical high resolution data for future time horizons, or from the use coarser temporal detail of the energy demands represented in energy system modelling tools [134].Interestingly, modelling tool developers also highlighted that the capabilities of their models not always correspond to their typical application.

        <p>An additional temporal aspect considered is the time horizon of the modelled outputs, as seen in Fig. 1. This shows that a large majority of the modelling tools can provide more than just a single snapshot of the energy system, but rather have the capability to outline multiple stages of the energy transition by providing multi-year outlooks, with some being capable of having more than one fixed time horizon. This modelling capability is reflective of the intent to outline the pathways of policy scenarios and sequential decision-making [135], as seenfor examplefor capacity expansion at a country level [136], to formulate energy policy at the EU level [137][138][139], or to assess regional and global decarbonization pathways [140].An additional temporal aspect considered is the time horizon of the modelled outputs, as seen in Fig. 1.

        <p>On the other hand, a smaller yet significant share of the modelling tools surveyed can also use a 1-year modelling time horizon or even shorter-term horizons. This comes with the potential advantage of lower computational effort and less uncertainty due to the number of assumptions and data inputs going into the modelling. While less detailed in outlining potential energy transition pathways, the application of a 1year time horizon can still outline end-and mid-point snapshots of technical developments or policy scenarios at selected years. This can provide high levels of detail of an energy system redesign to strive for, as illustrated in studies about urban energy transitions [141,142], national energy system redesigns [143][144][145][146], and regional studies [147][148][149]; in turn, acting as potential points for policy backcasting [150][151][152][153].On the other hand, a smaller yet significant share of the modelling tools surveyed can also use a 1-year modelling time horizon or even shorter-term horizons.

        <p>Putting these results into perspective, we can see that over the past decade advances have been made in how time is represented in modelling tools. Taking the study by Connolly et al. (2010) as an example, we can see that now a larger share of energy system modelling tools are capable of using hourly time-steps, compared to roughly half capable of such identified at the time for the 37 tools surveyed in that study [4]. In terms of the modelling time horizon, the results found in this survey are to an extent similar to those presented by Connolly et al. [4], which shows that most models surveyed then were already capable of handling multi-year time horizons, as well as yearly, and to a lesser extent coarser resolutions.Putting these results into perspective, we can see that over the past decade advances have been made in how time is represented in modelling tools.

        <p>Across the surveyed modelling tools, a levelled distribution was observed between tools working with aggregate technical specifications and those capable of representing individual plants or energy system components. Out of the 54 tools surveyed, 31 reported using individual plant details, while 23 reported using aggregate technical details. This reflectsin partthe nature of the tools sampled since some of them are capable of modelling large spatial aggregations on the global and regional scale (and in some cases even at the urban level), where aggregate operational detail provides adequate representation of the energy system [154,155], having an overall less significant impact than the temporal resolution [131].Across the surveyed modelling tools, a levelled distribution was observed between tools working with aggregate technical specifications and those capable of representing individual plants or energy system components.

        <p>On the other hand, some of the tools working with finer operational detail are tuned based on the purpose and scope; for instance, to flexibly represent project-specific components [156,157] or set up to represent specific dispatchable units or plants [158,159].On the other hand, some of the tools working with finer operational detail are tuned based on the purpose and scope; for instance, to flexibly represent project-specific components [156,157] or set up to represent specific dispatchable units or plants [158,159].</p>

        <p>As the global focus shifts towards higher penetration of renewable energy sources to decarbonize the energy system and to halt global warming, more effort has been put towards coupling the main energy sectors to benefit from their potential synergies. A vast range of reviews identify the challenges of integrating more renewable energy, mainly considering electricity sector [5,10,11]. However, as identified by Lund et al. [37], cross-sector integration can also be a pivotal aspect to incorporate larger shares of renewables, by facilitating additional flexibility in the energy system. This has been the subject of a number of studies (e.g. [149,[159][160][161][162]), which have analyzed the potential of integrating the electricity, heat, transport and industrial sectors, and thereby allowing 100% renewable energy shares in future energy system scenarios.As the global focus shifts towards higher penetration of renewable energy sources to decarbonize the energy system and to halt global warming, more effort has been put towards coupling the main energy sectors to benefit from their potential synergies.

        <p>As seen in Fig. 2 and Table 3, the inclusion of the electricity sector is shared across almost all the tools examined. For roughly half of these tools, it is furthermore possible to explicitly model both the transport sector and heating (including individual and district heating). However, it must be noted that when considering tools representing only the electricity vector, non-explicit approaches to represent scenarios where heating and transport are electrified can arise and, thus be partialy covered. Additional sector coverage is seen to a varying degree when looking at industry or cooling applications, and it is much less prominent considering biofuel production, being modelled by only one-third of the tools examined.As seen in Fig. 2 and Table 3, the inclusion of the electricity sector is shared across almost all the tools examined.

        <p>The common theme of the electricity sector is key to sectoral integration, since thermal, transport, and industry sectors are considered in the context of electrification in a smart energy system [163]. Indeed, it is expected that when incorporating these demands, the total electricity demand will markedly increase [160]. More importantly, however, these sectors can act as sources of demand response, having promising prospects to provide flexibility and improve the efficiency of the energy system [164]. This has been shown in prior studies when analyzing the potentials to shift industrial [165], thermal [166], and electric transport loads [167]. This flexibility can also be reaped within the electricity sector, by considering flexible demands responsive to the costs of generation dispatch, which could cover second priority loads. This can be done by covering these lower-priority demands in off-peak hours, or in the presence of excess electricity from fluctuating renewable sources when generation costs are lower [164,168,169]. In our survey, about 23 of the 54 models were capable of representing elastic demands responsive to supply costs (Fig. 3).The common theme of the electricity sector is key to sectoral integration, since thermal, transport, and industry sectors are considered in the context of electrification in a smart energy system [163].

This can be done by covering these lower-priority demands in off-peak hours, or in the presence of excess electricity from fluctuating renewable sources when generation costs are lower [164,168,169]. In our survey, about 23 of the 54 models were capable of representing elastic demands responsive to supply costs (Fig. 3).</p>
        <p>Common across all energy system models is the need to balance energy supply and demand. As seen in Fig. 3, energy demand is rarely a modelling outcome, but rather an exogenous input assumption, either as a static demand or with some elasticity. This requires that modellers represent energy demand for the variety of aforementioned sectors at the relevant temporal and spatial resolution of their modelling tool.Common across all energy system models is the need to balance energy supply and demand.

        <p>Focusing in on specific studies undertaken by some of the surveyed modelling tools, we see that the same data sources are often used, or that the hurdles to data acquisition are dealt with in similar ways.Focusing in on specific studies undertaken by some of the surveyed modelling tools, we see that the same data sources are often used, or that the hurdles to data acquisition are dealt with in similar ways.</p>
        <p>In the European context, hourly electricity demands are readily available from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) [170]. ENTSO-E data is used in several national scope studies [81,147,[171][172][173][174], although others source data directly from relevant national bodies [133,166,[175][176][177] or as a synthesis of ENTSO-E and national statistics, via the Open Power System database [178]. When data is unavailable for countries, or subnational regions are being modelled, scaling factors are applied based on aggregated demand statistics [147,179], relative population magnitudes [133,142,177], or additional economic parameters and weighting ratios [180]; in all such cases, it is not possible to verify validity.In the European context, hourly electricity demands are readily available from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) [170].

        <p>The inclusion of additional sectors beyond electricity poses additional difficulties, since high resolution measured data is not readily available outside the electricity sector. Instead, national statistics are usually mapped to representative profiles of demand [161,175]. In the case of thermal demand, heating degree days or hours are used in this process, whereby the deviation of outdoor temperature from a reference temperature indicates a requirement for heating or cooling. Several projects have endeavored to simulate thermal demand using both bottom-up and top-down approaches [169][170][171], but their incorporation by energy modelling tools is currently limited.The inclusion of additional sectors beyond electricity poses additional difficulties, since high resolution measured data is not readily available outside the electricity sector.

        <p>Although sources exist to understand historical demand at some resolution, future demand is understandably unknown. Frequently, historical demand is used directly when modelling a scenario of a future energy system, without altering its magnitude or shape [172,175,181]. The same approach has been used when projecting further back in time than available data allows, whereby a single year is used to represent all historical years of interest [133]. Yet, it is clear that demand changes over time. Roadmaps for energy systems, such as the EIA international energy outlook [182], include estimations of the increase in demand and have been used to scale the magnitude of model input profiles accordingly [166,183]. However, the magnitude of demand is not the only element that will change, the profile shape is also variable. Indeed, at the high (one hour) temporal resolution we see to be increasingly important to modellers, the dynamics of demand are as important as variable renewables; the two may even be coupled [184,185]. As with thermal demand, reliance on demand modelling tools is key to understanding future profile shapes, but is underutilized. An example of how they could be used is shown in [171], where the DeSTINEE [186] simulation tool is used to estimate electricity demand in Italy for the year 2050, considering full electrification of heat and transport sectors.Although sources exist to understand historical demand at some resolution, future demand is understandably unknown.

        <p>With the expanding number of energy modelling tools available, and with these having different focus points, it is interesting to see to what extent different tools are linked with each other. By linking tools, more issues can potentially be scrutinized by investigating multiple aspects or to complement their methodological approach and coverage. This has been the case in studies looking into combining the capabilities of energy system modelling tools and demand modelling [187], energy system modelling tools with different technological and temporal resolution [188], and linking bottom-up and top-down modelling approaches [189].With the expanding number of energy modelling tools available, and with these having different focus points, it is interesting to see to what extent different tools are linked with each other.

        <p>Based on the survey of energy tools, the most common linking approach is the so-called "soft-linking" of tools: 33 of the 54 tools have been run with other tools, by applying an external workflow or a linking tool. Soft-linking is in the scope of this review, defined as a clear definition of an approach towards how inputs and outputs from different tools can be utilized in combination. Thus, soft-linking does not interlink source-code specifically between two tools to operate automatically a Partially covers electricity as contributions for heating purposes. together. An example of soft-linking could be the energy scenario of one tool modelled in another energy system tool that can capture a finer temporal resolution and sectoral or technological details. If two or more tools are linked through their source code, we specify that as hard-linked tools. An example of this would be if the code of two or more energy system optimization tools are linked together in such a manner that they can be solved as a single, yet complex, optimization problem. Three of the tools in the survey have been hard linked to other tools. Five of the tools have been integrated into other tools, making new merged tools. The difference between an integrated tool and a hardlinked tool is as follows. In principle, with hard-linking, two separate tools still exist but linked to each other to exchange input/output data automatically. However, when two tools are fully integrated, the linked tools evolved into a new tool with a common set of input and output data. So, in total nine tools have been integrated with specific coding between tools. Out of all tools examined, 11 have not been linked to other tools, and for one the linking status was unknown for the tool developer. Further information regarding the type of tools connected between each other was not collected in the survey.Based on the survey of energy tools, the most common linking approach is the so-called "soft-linking" of tools: 33 of the 54 tools have been run with other tools, by applying an external workflow or a linking tool.

        <p>These results hint at a growing trend where complementary methodological approaches are used in tandem to leverage their capabilities and potential for additional insight. Fattahi et al. [35] present an example of this by reviewing the features and gaps of current energy system models and proposing a conceptual framework of how model coupling can take place between energy system modelling tools and regional models presenting infrastructure and resource constraints, electricity market, and macroeconomic modelling tools. Otherwise, more focused coupling efforts can also be found in the literature, including cases coupling top-down and bottom-up energy system modelling tools to gain insight about appropriateness of technology choices in the energy system and wider macroeconomic and welfare effects [189][190][191], linkages between technology-rich modelling tools and long-term planning ones to get more nuanced representations of the systems' sector coupling and flexibility options [159,[192][193][194], coupling tools forecasting fuel and transport demands with energy system simulation tools [195], or even combined efforts linking spatial analysis [146,196], and behavioral aspects of end-user transport demands [197,198] with energy system modelling tools. Likewise, linking socio-technical transition aspects with energy system tools can prove beneficial to capture more realism in modelling [34].These results hint at a growing trend where complementary methodological approaches are used in tandem to leverage their capabilities and potential for additional insight.

        <p>In all, the coordinated use of modelling tools and different approaches opens a world of possibilities to capture greater detail of the real-world and its dynamics with the energy system. Moreover, this could help in tackling modelling uncertainty, as a better representation could be captured by linking approaches. However, increasing modelling realism should not trump the functionality of modelling tools. While it is certainly impossible and impractical to create and all-encompassing model [19], the added complexity of model coupling could also be detrimental for uptake by relevant users, or for an eventual use of modelling outcomes which are perceived as being too-complex [58]. At its core, the interpretability of modelling outcomes will be rooted in a clear understanding of the underlying modelling assumptions and formulations rather than the increase realism of integrated modelling tools [3]. Thus, a balance between modelling complexity and interpretability and usability is necessary when considering tool coupling exercises.In all, the coordinated use of modelling tools and different approaches opens a world of possibilities to capture greater detail of the real-world and its dynamics with the energy system.

        <p>There is a current trend and focus on openness of energy system modelling tools [44,46,47,199,200], which, as gathered by Oberle &amp; Elsland [47], are well suited technically to model current challenges in the energy transition. As mentioned in Section 2, this open development is also one of the drivers behind the Open Energy Modelling Initiative [45,49], which gathers a growing number of open-source energy system models and frameworks. While this openness generates a natural exchange of knowledge between researchers and modellers and allows for a transparent modelling framework for modellers and users, it is essential to focus on user accessibility and third-party replicability [63].There is a current trend and focus on openness of energy system modelling tools [44,46,47,199,200], which, as gathered by Oberle &amp; Elsland [47], are well suited technically to model current challenges in the energy transition.

        <p>As explored in other fields of study, prospective users of open access tools still require adequate levels of guidance to learn how to use these, and enable subsequent model implementations [201]. In some cases, this can be facilitated by dedicated graphical interfaces as opposed to direct manipulation of the source code, especially when considering occasional users3 of a tool [202]. However, the selection of interface should accommodate the specific user-needs [203]. This is especially relevant as the uptake of energy system models as tools for decisionsupport can be hindered by the functionalities and complicatedness of use perceived by target users [28,58].As explored in other fields of study, prospective users of open access tools still require adequate levels of guidance to learn how to use these, and enable subsequent model implementations [201].

        <p>Therefore, we compare the tool openness with the tool's user interface. In Fig. 4, the same tool might appear more than once, but in total, 36 of the 54 models and tools surveyed can be free for other users. Of those, 22 are open source, and eight of these require additional commercial software or solvers to run. Only two freeware applications were reported which were not also open source, while 11 tools commercial (paid) software were identified. In addition, 11 tools were observed to be in-house tools that are not sold or provided to outside users. Moreover, 11 tools report being free under special conditions, or being available under request for academic purposes, and overlapping with some of the previous categories otherwise.Therefore, we compare the tool openness with the tool's user interface.

        <p>The open-source category, as well as most of the other categories, are to a large extent dominated by tools with direct coding options. For many of the tools, this is the only option to use the tool, although human-readable text interfaces are also available to more easily handle the code of some tools' code. In addition, under the "other" category for user-interface we identify that some tools can be used in diverse ways via other external applications such as 
            <rs type="software">Excel</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">Jupyter</rs> Notebooks, via bash controls, etc.
        </p>
        <p>Within the non-open source tools, whether they are free or commercial, the share of tools with a dedicated graphical user interface is more significant, while there is a lower number of tools with web-based interfaces.Within the non-open source tools, whether they are free or commercial, the share of tools with a dedicated graphical user interface is more significant, while there is a lower number of tools with web-based interfaces.</p>
        <p>Many energy tools are dependent on mathematical solvers to operate and find solutions. Talking about the accessibility of free tools, it is important if a tool can operate on open-source/free solvers. Of the 37 tools that indicated they use a solver, 23 are dependent on commercial software while only 8 of these are reported as being open source. This potentially also limits the accessibility of such open and/or free tools, especially looking outside of academic settings with special educational licensing agreements to access some of these solvers.Many energy tools are dependent on mathematical solvers to operate and find solutions.

        <p>A key aspect of energy system modelling is the ability to quantify the impacts of changes in the energy system and in this manner contribute to the public debate, while also supporting decisions to guide the energy transition [5,32,204]. Although it is commonly understood that energy policies are political decisions, the use of energy system modelling studies is important to inform and substantiate the policy-making process [7].A key aspect of energy system modelling is the ability to quantify the impacts of changes in the energy system and in this manner contribute to the public debate, while also supporting decisions to guide the energy transition [5,32,204].

        <p>In the survey, we attempt to quantify the number of tools that have made some policy contributions. We differentiate between those that have been used directly by an official governmental or public institution for guidance in official policy and indirectly by contributing to the discussion or used as a reference to contrast and/or validate official policies. An outline of this can be seen in Table 4.In the survey, we attempt to quantify the number of tools that have made some policy contributions.

        <p>Many of the surveyed tools have been used for policy support, both directly (e.g. PRIMES [205]) and indirectly, with some overlapping usage between these two categories (e.g. EnergyPLAN [206,207]). On the other hand, over a third of the models did not have any identifiable policy contribution. This could correspond to the fact that some of these tools are rather new in-house developments used within academic research, or they have been used for a limited scope of projects.Many of the surveyed tools have been used for policy support, both directly (e.g. PRIMES [205]) and indirectly, with some overlapping usage between these two categories (e.g. EnergyPLAN [206,207]).

        <p>While this certainly shows a gap between modelling and policy, it does not reflect on the modelling potential of such tools to answer policy-related questions. It does however raise a question regarding awareness of modelling tool application beyond initial development, and the involvement of policy-makers in discussions about modelling features and results. Such an involvement could enrich the end-use of energy system models, particularly to produce scenarios answering policy-related questions [7,17]. Ultimately, having this interaction with policy-makers and putting the models to use in decision-support also serve as form of legitimacy and could be viewed as a real-world validation of the energy system model in question [59].While this certainly shows a gap between modelling and policy, it does not reflect on the modelling potential of such tools to answer policy-related questions.

        <p>For this reason, it is important to understand the characteristics of the tools used for policy support applications. The attributes of these tools vary in terms of technical modelling characteristics, but also in their accessibility, target user-base and interfasing. In Fig. 5, an overview is presented of the different attributes found in those tools. From the results shown in Fig. 5, a few clear trends can be observed.For this reason, it is important to understand the characteristics of the tools used for policy support applications.

        <p>First, the tools used for policy-support tend to have high temporal resolution, relying mostly on hourly modelling. This has been specially the case for those tools reported to have direct policy applications, which responds to the need to model the energy system's dynamics when considering fluctuating demands and supply sources, as well as energy balancing. For the tools with indirect application, the hourly time resolution is apparently used as much as yearly resolutions. To a lesser extend, some tools also consider seasonal time-slices or multi-year resolutions to conduct their modelling.First, the tools used for policy-support tend to have high temporal resolution, relying mostly on hourly modelling.

        <p>In terms of modelling time-horizon, a multi-year outlook is seen to be most predominant among the surveyed tools with policy applications, while yearly horizons are less used. The ability to represent multiple years facilitates outlining long-term policy pathways, making it a valuable attribute when modelling transition scenarios for the energy system. On the other hand, 1-year horizons, while not explicitly modelling transition pathways, can still aptly model different end-and mid-point scenarios for the enegy system, making them equally valid tools for policy analysis and support.In terms of modelling time-horizon, a multi-year outlook is seen to be most predominant among the surveyed tools with policy applications, while yearly horizons are less used.

        <p>As seen in Fig. 5, the ability to represent multiple energy sectors and end-uses is widely considered in the tools with policy applications. Here, the electricity sector seems to be slightly more well represented, however other key sectors and end-uses are also considered to an almost equal extent. Interestingly, those tools used indirectly for policy support report having higher representation of some of these sectors, with a slight edge on modelling transport, industry and cooling. By contrast, the overall number of tools surveyed, shown prior in Fig. 2, show a gap between modelling the electricity and other sectors and end-uses.As seen in Fig. 5, the ability to represent multiple energy sectors and end-uses is widely considered in the tools with policy applications.

        <p>The energy demand representation in the tools used for policy support falls mostly under static demand representations, with elastic demands also being represented. On the other hand, endonegous demand modelling does not seem to be a common feature present in these models. This aligns with the discussion in Section 4.4. However, endogenous demand representations is slightly more predominant in the tools used for indirect policy support. On the other hand, we see that most of the energy system modelling tools with policy applications rely on connections with other tools, likely to supplement their modelling capabilities.The energy demand representation in the tools used for policy support falls mostly under static demand representations, with elastic demands also being represented.

        <p>Finaly, regarding the access and use of the tool, it is possible to see some clear cut distinctions between the tools used directly and indirectly for policy support. For instance, while open source access seems to be a prefereed attribute in the observed tools, the use of commercial and nonopen source freeware seems more prevalent in direct policy applications. Similarly, tools used for direct policy-support seem more likely to provide graphical user interfaces, in contrast with direct coding, mostly found in those modelling tools used indirectly for policy support applications. Ultimately, this could potentially be associated to the target user-base of the modelling tools as seen in Fig. 5, where we see that for direct policy support the main user-base consists of private/ commercial users, as well as academics and government/public officials; while, academic users make up the main user-base of those tools used for indirect policy-support.Finaly, regarding the access and use of the tool, it is possible to see some clear cut distinctions between the tools used directly and indirectly for policy support.

        <p>This study reviews recent trends in energy system modelling tools by surveying the existing literature and gathering inputs directly from tool developers about the features and applications of their modelling tools. Unlike previous review studies found in the literature, this contribution establishes a direct communication with modellers and developers of the tools through a questionnaire, to reflect the way these developers understand their tool under a common terminology, while also addressing issues that previous survey-based studies have not put much focus on, such as the factual policy-relevance of studies conducted by an energy system modelling tool, the accessibility, openness and usability of the tool, and possible model coupling applications. This reduces the risk of misinterpretation or biased assessment of different tools by relying on their published information, although with a limited sample of tools surveyed. Moreover, the survey offers an avenue to gather information about the real-world application of the tools directly from their developers.This study reviews recent trends in energy system modelling tools by surveying the existing literature and gathering inputs directly from tool developers about the features and applications of their modelling tools.

        <p>This, of course, does not come free of downsides, like the potential exclusion in the current survey of some well-documented modelling tools, in cases where no responses were gathered for the questionnaire, or by considering representative 'members' from a family of models which might have different technical attributes to their source. Moreover, potential biases in the survey can arise as the majority of the past reviews, and the models survey stem from European research, which could hint at a focus on modelling specific aspect of European energy transition paradigms. Nonetheless, we recommend this line of dialogue with tool developers when conducting future review exercises in order to gather insight about the modelling applications of a particular tool or for validation purposes, and more generally to identify trends in the field of energy system modelling. From this, the following points appeared to be evident after the process of conducting the survey, including both literature reviews and modelling tools.This, of course, does not come free of downsides, like the potential exclusion in the current survey of some well-documented modelling tools, in cases where no responses were gathered for the questionnaire, or by considering representative 'members' from a family of models which might have different technical attributes to their source.

        <p>First, it is challenging to agree on a specific vocabulary that all tool developers reach consensus in the same way. For instance, multiple studies have focused on proposing new classification schemes and to categorize different modelling approaches or methodologies. While some of these categories are unambiguous, other descriptive labels assigned to tools might fall within an overlapping spectrum which is harder to define. This is not surprising as an overlap between modelling methodologies does exist; it highlights, however, the importance of communication between modellers when discussing different modelling methods and would be relevant when interpreting the tools application or when working on linking different tools. Similarly, expanding this dialogue can also provide a better understanding of a tool's intended design versus its inferred potential applications obtained from only reviewing modelling features, as seen in Section 4.2. regarding the typical modelling time-step used by some tools and the clarifications from tool developers, or in Section 4.6 regarding their policy-related applications. However, it is important to point out that surveying can only be fully effective if there is a common understanding of terminology and a clear framing of survey questions. As a case in point, a survey question like "How is energy demand modelled in the tool?" can be understood in many ways, such as in terms of energy carriers (e.g. a country's demand for oil) or in terms of end-uses (e.g. demand for energy from households). In turn, this could lead to potential misunderstandings on whether the demand is modelled endogenously or exogenously depending on how the respondent interprets demand in the first place.First, it is challenging to agree on a specific vocabulary that all tool developers reach consensus in the same way.

        <p>Second, modelling tools rely on exogenous demand datasets. Yet, there is still a lack of accessible data for modellers to understand projected and uncertain changes in demand, and to model high spatial and temporal resolution systems. Where available, standard input datasets are relied upon in energy system models, irrespective of their research focus, representing the frontier of data availability. The modelling of cross-sectoral decarbonization will open new challenges, including the integration of sectors for which ever more data is required and the need to specify demand that is matched to the weather conditions influencing the increasing prevalence of variable renewable generation. For this, coupling with demand modelling tools is necessary, but nascent. In addition to issues of data availability, greater energy system complexity and reliance on non-dispatchable technologies exposes the inadequacy of exogenous demand. Instead, modelling tools must embrace elastic and endogenous demand to develop highly interconnected energy systems.Second, modelling tools rely on exogenous demand datasets.

        <p>Third, when investigating many tools that can do different things in terms of modelling energy transitions, it becomes clear that it is impossible to build a tool that can do it all. Most of the tools have been developed to fulfil a specific task within a defined scope or according to specific user-needs. It might have received updates and an increased number of capabilities, but the underlying general architecture, technology, and terminology remains the same. We would argue that efforts should be targeted towards linking these different tools to each other, utilizing the many capabilities that are already present. Individual tool development is obviously still required and necessary, but there is a trade-off between the details and granularity of a model and computational resources. In line with this, future review efforts could also study in more detail model coupling exercises and identify more specifically which tools are coupled together, which specific typologies exist and the trade-offs of coupling approaches. For instance, this could be done by examining the coupling of energy system modelling tools with demand models, socio-technical energy transition models, etc.Third, when investigating many tools that can do different things in terms of modelling energy transitions, it becomes clear that it is impossible to build a tool that can do it all.

        <p>Finally, the transparency and policy-relevant applications of energy system modelling tools should be put into a real-world perspective. For example, the complexity of linking modelling tools should not jeopardize the interpretability of the underlying modelling assumptions and outcomes, as this would detract modellers and output consumers (e.g. decision/policy-makers). In line with this, model development should be conducted in such a way that it leads to actionable research, and in which policy and decision support takes center stage. In this regard, further research could be conducted to identify how user-needs and policy-making processes mark the development of modelling tools actually used for decision-support, and which features these have and need.Finally, the transparency and policy-relevant applications of energy system modelling tools should be put into a real-world perspective.

        <p>In line with this, modelling interpretability goes beyond the access to open code and the perceived transparency that this provides. While open development and open source development is laudable and a recommended practice, the "out-of-the-box" usability of a tool also needs to be accounted for as an additional dimension of accessibility. Doing so could enhance the application of energy modelling tools and allow for a more active engagement with a wider multiplicity of actors that can actively contribute and enrich the energy policy debate by using modelling outcomes, while also validating the appropriateness of energy system modelling tools in the real-world arena.In line with this, modelling interpretability goes beyond the access to open code and the perceived transparency that this provides.
