        <p>Atomic collision processes are fundamental to numerous advanced materials technologies such as electron microscopy, semiconductor processing and nuclear power generation. Extensive experimental and computer simulation studies over the past several decades provide the physical basis for understanding the atomic-scale processes occurring during primary displacement events. The current international standard for quantifying this energetic particle damage, the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens displacements per atom (NRT-dpa) model, has nowadays several well-known limitations. In particular, the number of radiation defects produced in energetic cascades in metals is only ~1/3 the NRT-dpa prediction, while the number of atoms involved in atomic mixing is about a factor of 30 larger than the dpa value.Atomic collision processes are fundamental to numerous advanced materials technologies such as electron microscopy, semiconductor processing and nuclear power generation.

        <p>The importance of the calculated dpa parameter is that it is the starting point for calculations of virtually all radiation effects in solid materials, and it facilitates quantitative comparisons of different materials irradiated with the same irradiation source as well as materials irradiated in different irradiation sources such as electron, ion and neutron irradiation [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] facilities. Estimation of the damage is also important in modern materials processing by focused ion beams, or when irradiating nanomaterials 9,10 . However, it has been recognized for several decades that the dpa value calculated from Eq. (1) for energetic cascades in pure metals on the one hand overestimates the number of stable defects by a factor of 3 to 4 (refs. [11][12][13][14] ), and on the other hand underestimates the amount of atomic mixing (atoms permanently displaced from their initial lattice position to replace an atom in another position) 13,15,16 that takes place as a result of the cascade. Even though the initial effect is on the nanometric scale, it has also been estimated that it can lead to macroscopic consequences such as a 5-year underestimation of the lifetime of a nuclear reactor pressure vessel exposed to a very high thermal flux 17 . Similar trends have also been reported for intermetallic alloys 18 and ceramics [19][20][21] . Figure 1 illustrates the time-dependent evolution of a displacement cascade based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a typical metal (see Methods section). Such a displacement cascade can be induced by a passing neutron or other high-energy (MeV or more) particle. The first lattice atom to receive a recoil energy is called the primary knock-on atom. Note how initially, when the atoms are highly excited, many of them are displaced from their lattice sites. However, as the cascade begins to thermally equilibrate with its surroundings, nearly all atoms regain positions in the perfect lattice structure. It is because of these two so-called heat spike effects 22,23 (also known in parts of the literature as 'thermal spike') that the amount of final defects generated is much smaller, and the number of atoms replacing other atoms (atomic mixing) much larger than the prediction from simple linear collision cascade models such as the NRT-dpa model (see Fig. 2). The physical reasons to this are discussed in detail in the following two subsections (building upon an earlier review work by us 24 ), which also present improved functional forms and tests of these against experimental and new simulation data.The importance of the calculated dpa parameter is that it is the starting point for calculations of virtually all radiation effects in solid materials, and it facilitates quantitative comparisons of different materials irradiated with the same irradiation source as well as materials irradiated in different irradiation sources such as electron, ion and neutron irradiation [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] facilities.

        <p>In-cascade recombination effects on defect production. The physical basis for the overprediction by the NRT-dpa model of the defect production at high energies is the enhanced recombination of defects in close proximity in energetic displacement cascades. The binary collision simulations used as the basis of the NRT-dpa model 3 Blue circles illustrate atoms with low temperature and red and whitish atoms have high kinetic energies, with the energy scale given to the right. Note how initially, when the atoms are hot (high kinetic energy), a large number of atoms are displaced from their lattice sites. However, as the cascade cools down, almost all atoms regain positions in the perfect lattice sites. It is because of these two so-called 'heat spike' effects that the number of atoms replacing other atoms is much larger and the amount of final defects generated much smaller than the prediction from simple linear collision cascade models like the NRT-dpa model displacement cascade and did not consider the dynamics of cascade evolution as atomic velocities fell to the speed of sound (~5 eV) and lower, when many-body interactions become relevant. In energetically dense cascades, like that shown in Fig. 1, local melting clearly plays an important role in defect retention and structure. With increasing primary knock-on atom energy, the displacement event produces progressively more Frenkel defects (pairs of vacancies and interstitials 25 ) that are spatially close to other defects. The ~10-100 jumps occurring per atom during the 1-10 ps cascade cooling phase 14 can induce significant additional recombination events as the cascade atom energies decrease, following the collisional phase, from E d to the threshold value for atomic migration (E m ~0.01-0.3 eV for self-interstitial atoms and ~0.5-1 eV for vacancies).

        <p>This simple model thus provides an intuitive explanation for why cascade damage production is sublinear with damage energy in the heat spike regime.

These x values are slightly larger than the value obtained in our simplified model because real cascades are not perfectly spherical and some defects form small clusters, reducing the recombination probability.This simple model thus provides an intuitive explanation for why cascade damage production is sublinear with damage energy in the heat spike regime.

        <p>Replacements-per-atom (rpa) model. Since the NRT-dpa model deals with production of defects that are not on perfect lattice sites, it cannot predict the number of atoms that are transported from their initial lattice site to a new lattice site, i.e. replace another atom in a perfect crystal site (right panel in Fig. 2c). This number of atom replacements is experimentally measurable via so-called radiation mixing experiments. Typically, an ion beam is used to bombard a thin marker layer inside a material, and the resulting broadening of the marker layer is measured 16,34 . For ordered alloys, it can also be conveniently measured by electrical resistivity 15 . Via an analogy with random walk atom diffusion, it is possible to relate this measured broadening to the actual number of atom replacements per ion inside the material 35 . Analysis of neutron and ion beam radiation mixing data has shown that the actual number of replaced atoms can be more than an order of magnitude larger than the number of displacements predicted by the NRT-dpa model 15,[36][37][38] . A correct estimation of this number can be of enormous importance in predicting the effects of irradiation on phase stability 39,40 and the associated mechanical properties of materials. Nanostructured materials, such as nanolaminates and nanoscale oxide-dispersion strengthened steels, are particularly sensitive to these errors owing to their small length scales. The superlinear increase in the number of replaced atoms with increasing knock-on atom energy can be understood by a model considering the spatial extent of a collision cascade. We consider first low energies (in the keV regime) and dense materials, where cascades are normally compact. As noted above, low-energy cascades are roughly spherical. After the ballistic phase of a cascade, MD simulations show (cf. Fig. 1) that the lattice breaks down and a liquid-like region forms. In this region all atoms are free to move and hence are almost certain to lead to one or more replacements during the thermal spike phase (as illustrated in Fig. 2c, right frame). The number of atoms N in a spherical cascade of radius R is proportional to the sphere volume, i.e. N∝R 3 , and (as already noted for the arc-dpa model) R / T x d . We thus find that the number of replaced atoms N rpa / T 3x d . Since x &gt; 1/3, this simple consideration gives an intuitive explanation for why the number of replaced atoms increases superlinearly with energy at low energies, when cascades are compact. At high energies, when cascades split into subcascades 32,41 , the behaviour can be expected to change to a linear dependence with damage energy.

In this functional form, b rpa has a physical meaning as the average energy for subcascade breakdown in terms of number of replaced atoms. Moreover, similar to the arc-dpa form, Eq. ( 9) fulfils the same conditions of continuity and compatibility with the NRT-dpa model.</p>
        <p>We first reiterate the physical meaning of the newly introduced material constants. b rpa is related to the subcascade formation energy, and has energy units. The unitless exponents b arcdpa and c rpa are associated with the dependence of the ion range with energy. Finally, the unitless quantity c arcdpa is associated with the saturation value of damage recombination with heat spike size.We first reiterate the physical meaning of the newly introduced material constants. b rpa is related to the subcascade formation energy, and has energy units.

        <p>As a summary of the arc-dpa and rpa models, Fig. 3 compares the obtained rpa and arc-dpa curves with the NRT dpa prediction for Fe and W, as a function of damage energy. Note that the NRT-dpa damage production equation does not, except at the very lowest energies near 100 eV, describe correctly either the surviving defects or the amount of radiation mixing in energetic displacement cascades. The newly introduced arc-dpa correction factor ξ arcdpa for the primary damage leads to a calculated surviving defect fraction about a factor of 3 lower than the NRT-dpa prediction, and the rpa correction factor ξ rpa leads to the calculated number of atom replacements to be about 30 times higher than the predicted NRT displacement value. Both the correction factors agree very well with MD simulation results over more than three orders of magnitude in energy for all elements, giving confidence that the derived functional forms are well motivated. We note that when additional and more accurate MD or experimental data becomes available, the models (Eqs. ( 6) and ( 9)) could be refined for a better description e.g. near the threshold.As a summary of the arc-dpa and rpa models, Fig. 3 compares the obtained rpa and arc-dpa curves with the NRT dpa prediction for Fe and W, as a function of damage energy.

        <p>We also considered the dependence of the results on the ambient temperature. Several previous studies have shown that the effect of ambient temperature on primary damage production or atom replacements at ps time scales is insignificant or weak up to temperatures around roughly half the melting point 14,42,43 . For this work, we also simulated two of the data points for W at an elevated temperature, 800 K. The results (solid circles in Fig. 3b) show that both the damage and replacements is the same within the statistical uncertainty as those at low temperature for the same potential. We note that given sufficiently large and statistically accurate data sets for a range of higher elevated temperatures, it would be possible to make the arc-dpa and rpa model parameters temperature-dependent.We also considered the dependence of the results on the ambient temperature.

        <p>We note that, in spite of its failure to predict damage production correctly, the original NRT-dpa standard remains useful for comparing scaled radiation dose (exposure), as it is essentially proportional to the collision-relevant portion of radiation energy deposited per volume. The correct use of this standard as the first variable by which to compare radiation damage levels in different environments remains, therefore, strongly recommended. The new models, arc-dpa and rpa, developed here extend the usefulness of the dpa in that, while they can also be used to compare different irradiations, they in addition give accurate predictions of primary damage production and radiation mixing. They are deliberately constructed in such a way that they are easy to implement in existing radiation effects software: they add only four additional parameters (or two, if only one of the two new models is used) for each element. The arc-dpa and rpa equations thus enable a significant increase in physical relevance with minimal increase in computational efficiency or complexity. Of course, however, the practical application of arc-dpa and rpa requires the construction of suitable databases of parameters for each material: not only E d but also the b and c constants. Collectively, the new models represent an important step towards improved quantification of the primary damage state during irradiation of materials.We note that, in spite of its failure to predict damage production correctly, the original NRT-dpa standard remains useful for comparing scaled radiation dose (exposure), as it is essentially proportional to the collision-relevant portion of radiation energy deposited per volume.

        <p>In general, these damage models are expected to be relevant for many other materials besides the elemental metals discussed here. Studies of damage in metal alloys indicate the arc-dpa model will be directly applicable to both dilute 44 and concentrated 45 metal alloys. In non-metallic materials, the arc-dpa function may not be universally relevant, as damage production involves effects such as amorphization 25 that cannot be captured by any simple equation. However, some ceramic materials are known to undergo significant in-cascade recombination [19][20][21] , and for these arc-dpa can be useful. On the other hand, the rpa function can be expected to be relevant in any material where heat spikes are significant (i.e. all dense materials), since in all of these the atomic mixing will be enhanced by collective atomic motion. The formation of the arc-dpa and rpa also motivate systematic experimental and simulation studies to understand better the primary state of damage in non-metallic systems, where (with the exception of Si) studies are scarce.In general, these damage models are expected to be relevant for many other materials besides the elemental metals discussed here.

        <p>Prior to concluding, we emphasize that the arc-dpa and rpa models deal with the primary damage state only, i.e. the damage produced during the first few ps after a collision cascade initiated. Already at room temperature, thermally activated defect migration is known to be significant, and can reduce the damage production significantly from the arc-dpa value due to recombination effects, or enhance atom mixing from the rpa value. They also do not describe defect clustering or damage overlap effects 45- 47 . However, even for these cases the new functions can be useful, as a starting point for e.g. kinetic Monte Carlo or rate theory calculations of high-dose irradiation effects 45 (where cascades overlap) or conditions where thermal defect migration recombines defects.Prior to concluding, we emphasize that the arc-dpa and rpa models deal with the primary damage state only, i.e. the damage produced during the first few ps after a collision cascade initiated.

        <p>In conclusion, the new arc-dpa and rpa models introduced here allow, in a very simple and efficient way, to incorporate the improved understanding on radiation defect generation mechanisms gained during the last four decades into software calculating primary radiation damage generation rates in macroscopic reactor components. The arc-dpa model accounts for the enhanced recombination active in pure metals as well as in many alloys, which strongly reduces the number of point defects present in the primary damage, compared to the traditional NRTdpa model. The rpa model provides a measure of the volume of the irradiated material directly affected by the cascade, which is important e.g. for phase stability considerations. In calculations of radiation damage effects where the dpa measure is used as a starting point, these new functions provide improved accuracy in a simple analytical form. This allows, e.g., differentiating between irradiation conditions dominated by either low-or high-energy recoils, and perhaps even more importantly, introduces the possibility to quantify analytically the very large (about two orders of magnitude) difference between damage production and atom relocation effects.In conclusion, the new arc-dpa and rpa models introduced here allow, in a very simple and efficient way, to incorporate the improved understanding on radiation defect generation mechanisms gained during the last four decades into software calculating primary radiation damage generation rates in macroscopic reactor components.

        <p>Molecular dynamics simulations. The new data used for the fits of the arc-dpa and rpa functions were obtained from MD simulations following Refs. 31,36,37,48,49 . The Fe damage data is from ref. 48 or the references indicated in the figure, and the Ni, Pd and Pt data from ref. 49 , and other data previously unpublished. In all cases, a crystalline simulation cell in either the face-centred cubic or body-centred cubic crystal structure was first constructed and equilibrated by a short (few picoseconds) MD simulation at room temperature. The interatomic interactions were modelled with equilibrium reactive interatomic potentials to which the ZBL repulsive potential 36 was joint at small separations to realistically mimic high-energy interactions. The interatomic potentials indicated by abbreviations in the figures are for Cu: CEM: ref. 50 , S-L: ref. 51 and for W: DD: ref. 52 , JW: ref. 53 , AT: ref. 54 , AH: ref. 55 .Molecular dynamics simulations.

        <p>Periodic boundary conditions were used in all directions, to correspond to highenergy ion or neutron effects deep inside a material, and the lattice constant was set to the equilibrium value at 0 K (previous works show that 0 and 300 K primary damage results are identical within the statistical uncertainty in transition metals). After equilibration, an atom was selected randomly near the centre of the simulation cell, and given a recoil energy in a random direction in three dimensions. The central parts of the simulation cell were simulated in the NVE ensemble, while excess energy was removed from the system using temperature scaling towards room temperature in the outermost 1 unit cell thick regions of the cell. To account for energy loss to ionizations, the ZBL96 electronic stopping power 29 was applied as a frictional force on all atoms with a kinetic energy higher than 10 eV, and the damage energy T d was calculated as the difference between the initial recoil energy and the total sum of energy lost to electronic stopping. The damage was analysed using the Wigner-Seitz cells approach 31 that is space-filling and hence allows for a unique determination of whether a defect is vacancy-or interstitial-type.Periodic boundary conditions were used in all directions, to correspond to highenergy ion or neutron effects deep inside a material, and the lattice constant was set to the equilibrium value at 0 K (previous works show that 0 and 300 K primary damage results are identical within the statistical uncertainty in transition metals).
