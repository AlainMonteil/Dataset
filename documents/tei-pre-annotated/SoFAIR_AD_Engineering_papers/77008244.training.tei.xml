        <p>A series of porous organic cages is examined for the selective adsorption of sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) over nitrogen. Despite lacking any metal sites, a porous cage, CC3, shows the highest SF 6 /N 2 selectivity reported for any material at ambient temperature and pressure, which translates to real separations in a gas breakthrough column. The SF 6 uptake of these materials is considerably higher than would be expected from the static pore structures. The location of SF 6 within these materials is elucidated by x-ray crystallography, and it is shown that cooperative diffusion and structural rearrangements in these molecular crystals can rationalize their superior SF 6 /N 2 selectivity.A series of porous organic cages is examined for the selective adsorption of sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) over nitrogen.

        <p>Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO 2, 1,2 with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 800-3200 years. 1 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found SF 6 to be the most potent greenhouse gas that it evaluated, with a global warming potential 23,900 times higher than CO 2 . 3 Nonetheless, SF 6 has valuable and widespread industrial uses. For example, SF 6 or SF 6 /N 2 mixtures are often used to insulate electrical equipment. 2,4 SF 6 is also a good thermo-acoustic insulator for windows, a contrast agent in medical applications, and a plasma etchant in the semiconductor industry. 5 There is much current interest in finding effective materials for the separation of SF 6 from gas mixtures to prevent its release into the atmosphere and to allow economically viable capture and re-use. 6 Pressure swing adsorption / desorption processes using a suitable porous material offer considerable energy savings over liquefaction, but this requires high selectivity for SF 6 adsorption over N 2 adsorption. 7 Various porous solids have been tested for SF 6 adsorption or separation 8 such as carbons, 9,10 zeolites, [11][12][13] metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), 5,6 and pillared clays. 14 Until now, the most selective of these materials have been zeolite 13X 12 and a series of isostructural MOFs with a high density of unsaturated metal sites. 6 The success of these materials was attributed to their pore diameters (10 and 11 Å, respectively), which were identified by Monte Carlo simulations as close to ideal.Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO 2, 1,2 with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 800-3200 years. 1 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found SF 6 to be the most potent greenhouse gas that it evaluated, with a global warming potential 23,900 times higher than CO 2 . 3 Nonetheless, SF 6 has valuable and widespread industrial uses.

        <p>All microporous solids tested for SF 6 separation so far have been insoluble, extended networks or macromole-cules. Nitschke et al demonstrated that a metal-organic capsule could capture and release SF 6 in solution 27 , but such molecular separation of SF 6 by a cage molecule has not yet been shown in the gas phase. However, there is also growing interest in porous molecular cages. [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] These cages contain an internal void that is accessible via welldefined windows, and the rigid structure of the cages prevents collapse, thus providing porosity for guest molecules. Porous organic cages have been synthesized from imines, [15][16][17] boronic esters, 28 and by direct carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. 29 Apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas for nitrogen as high as 3758 m 2 g -1 have been achieved. 30 Since these cages are discrete molecules, as opposed to frameworks, they are soluble in common organic solvents and can be processed into support materials and precipitated or crystallized into the solid state as required. We previously reported a class of [4+6] cycloimine cage compounds that show gas uptakes and physicochemical stabilities that are remarkable for molecular organic crystals. [31][32][33] The gas sorption properties of these cages depends both on their molecular structure, and on their crystal packing, and many of these cages can exist as multiple polymorphs. 31,34,35 These cages are excellent candidates for the molecular separation of noble gases, 36 chiral molecules, 36 and hydrocarbon isomers. 37-39b In this study, a series of these organic cages (Fig. 1) was investigated for their potential in the separation of SF 6 .

CC2α exhibits one dimensional pore channels (yellow) in addition to internal cage cavities (orange), which may also be accessible depending on the size of the guest.

        <p>A 100 ns well-tempered metadynamics simulation was performed with DL_POLY2.20 47 and PLUMED2. 48 The OPLS-AA force field parameters, 49 and the Leapfrog Verlet algorithm 50 with a timestep of 0.5 fs was used. The Nose-Hoover thermostat 51 was used to keep the temperature fixed at 300 K and no interactions were applied between periodic images in a cubic system with cell length 39 Å. A timestep of 0.5 fs with sampling step of 1 ps was chosen and full molecular motion was allowed throughout the simulation. The collective variable along which the metadynamics bias was accumulated measured the distance between the center of mass of the fully flexible CC3 and the sulfur atom of the SF 6 . Gaussian hills with a width of 0.15 nm and an initial height of 1.2 kJ mol -1 were added every 500 MD steps and the so-called well-tempered factor was set equal to 10. The free energy surface was calculated using the 'sum_hills' utility of PLUMED2 with the minimum shifted to zero. An additional well-tempered metadynamics simulation using two collective variables (the distance and a torsion angle) was performed to analyse the mechanism further, see SI for further details.A 100 ns well-tempered metadynamics simulation was performed with DL_POLY2.20 47 and PLUMED2. 48 The OPLS-AA force field parameters, 49 and the Leapfrog Verlet algorithm 50 with a timestep of 0.5 fs was used.

        <p>Gas adsorption analyses revealed that all four cages were porous to SF 6 , but with marked differences in terms of adsorption capacities that relate to their structures (Fig. 2a-f). It is interesting that SF 6 is adsorbed by the smaller cages at all: from a simple static representation of their crystal structures, SF 6 would not be expected to be able to diffuse through the pore channels of CC2α, CC3α and CC13β. However, these organic crystals are somewhat flexible. 52 They are comprised of discrete molecules held together by weak intermolecular dispersion forces, rather than covalently bonded frameworks, and this has been shown previously to allow "porosity without pores". [53][54][55] Hence CC2α, CC3α and CC13β can adsorb SF 6 , despite the fact that this gas is larger than the static window diameter in the cages. The kinetic diameter of SF 6 , is 5.5 Å, 56 and thus one might not expect it to diffuse into the smaller imine cages (CC2, CC3, CC13) since their window diameters are ~3.6 Å. 52 Indeed, previous unbiased MD simulations for CC3α demonstrated that SF 6 did not escape the cage cavity in which it was originally positioned over a 10 ns simulation using a forcefield tailored to describe the flexibility in imine cages. 52 Hence, to analyse the SF 6 diffusion mechanism for these smaller cages and to calculate the energetic barrier to this event, we carried out welltempered metadynamics simulations of SF 6 and a single CC3 molecule (see Supporting Information for full simulation details). To understand the diffusion mechanism, we can think of the SF 6 molecule as two connected triangular faces, rather than a sphere that describes the widest possible diameter. As can be seen in Figure 3 and Movie S1, SF 6 exits the cage by first aligning its outermost triangular face with the triangular cage window. There is then a rotation of ~60° (Fig. 3a-d) such that the second face can align with the cage window and thus pass through. The barrier to the SF 6 diffusion through the flexible cage window is calculated to be at most 40 kJ mol -1 , and the configurations near the saddle point have the center of the SF 6 traversing the window. While crystal packing ef-fects would likely influence this barrier to a small extent, it is of similar magnitude to that previously calculated for the allowed para-xylene diffusion in the same host system. 37 It is therefore reasonable that the SF 6 diffuses, albeit slowly, in this system. A comparison of a single empty CC3 window diameter distribution with the measured window diameter during the SF 6 passage (Fig. 3e) reveals the cooperative character of the mechanism.

        <p>CC3α shows the highest affinity for SF 6 of the four cages tested, and a steep type I isotherm that saturates at low pressures (Fig. 2b). This is manifested in the highest heat of adsorption of ~35-40 kJ mol-1 (Fig. 2f). The saturation uptake corresponds to around 2.9 SF 6 molecules per CC3 cage (Fig. 2e). This is consistent with one SF 6 molecule in the internal cage cavity, plus one SF 6 molecule shared in each of the four window-window sites surrounding every cage, equating to a maximum theoretical loading of 3 SF 6 molecules per CC3 cage. CC2α shows the lowest SF 6 uptake and the lowest heat of adsorption (Figs. 2a,2f). The 1D pore channels in CC2α, 33 which run between the hexagonally-arrayed cages, are wide enough to accommodate SF 6 . The uptake of 1.4 SF6 molecules per cage (Fig. 2e) confirms that these 1D channels must be at least partially occupied. CC5α displays the highest SF 6 adsorption capacity, of 10.2 SF 6 per cage, in line with its larger internal void size and its higher surface area and pore volume. 41 However, the heat of adsorption is much lower than for CC3α, and hence CC5α adsorbs less SF 6 at lower pressures. CC13β gives a lower heat of adsorption than CC3α, despite having a similar pore structure. The difference between the high temperature (298 K) and low temperature (230 K) SF 6 uptakes for CC13β is significant. At 230 K, CC13β adsorbs around 6 SF 6 molecules per cage -that is, twice as much gas as CC3α. This can be rationalized only if the SF 6 molecules are located in the intercage sites, of which there are three per CC13 (Fig. 1b; blue nodes), as well as in the cage cavities and the window-window sites. While these intercage sites were shown previously to be accessible to nitrogen, 31 the size of the nodes relative to SF 6 suggested to us that significant rearrangement would be required to accommodate this larger gas. To explore this, the adsorption of SF 6 in CC13β was monitored by PXRD (Fig. 4). The PXRD pattern changes significantly as the structure is loaded with SF 6 , losing intensity in the high angle range. This is consistent with the preservation of the long-range packing of the cage modules, but a more disordered local structure, which could allow the large SF 6 guest to diffuse through the crystal. This reorganization of the CC13 allows the incorporation of such a large quantity of SF 6 (6 per cage), which cannot not be rationalized by the original empty structure. It is remarkable that the crystallinity is restored completely to its initial state after removal of the SF 6 , even after multiple cycles (Fig. S1). This behavior is allowed by the relatively weak dispersion forces between the cages, which enable reorganization in response to guests.CC3α shows the highest affinity for SF 6 of the four cages tested, and a steep type I isotherm that saturates at low pressures (Fig. 2b).

It is remarkable that the crystallinity is restored completely to its initial state after removal of the SF 6 , even after multiple cycles (Fig. S1). This behavior is allowed by the relatively weak dispersion forces between the cages, which enable reorganization in response to guests.</p>
        <p>The SF 6 isotherms for CC3α suggested excellent potential for SF 6 separation from nitrogen, and therefore the nitrogen isotherms were measured at equivalent temperatures (Fig. S2) to allow the calculation of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) predicted selectivity (Figs. 5, andS3). 57 The industrially relevant composition for separation of an SF 6 /N2 mixture is SF 6 :N2 = 10%:90%. 6,12 At 1 bar pressure CC3α gives a selectivity of 178 at 273 K, and 74 at 298 K). This surpasses the most promising candidate material previously reported, UiO-66-Zr (selectivity = 74, at 1 bar, 293 K) 58 and other similar framework materials such as Zn-MOF-74 (selectivity = 46, at 1 bar, 298 K), 6 Ca-A zeolite (28 at 1 bar, 298 K), 13 and zeolite-13X (44 at 1 bar, 298 K). 12 The total capacity of CC3α for SF 6 is higher than many of the frameworks reported (e.g., UiO-66-Zr is ~1.5 mmol, at 293 K and 1 bar), but lower than the highest (Mg-MOF-74 = 6.42 mmol/g at 1 bar, 298 K). A crystallographic study allowed for the location of SF 6 in CC3α to be accurately determined (Figs. 6, andS4). Wellordered SF 6 molecules were located, with full site occupancies, in the intrinsic CC3 cavities (Fig S4). CC3 provides an ideal fit for SF 6 in terms of both size and geometry of the cage cavity (Fig. 6), which explains the high heat of adsorption that we observe. The ordering of SF 6 molecules in the CC3 cavities transforms the crystallographic symmetry from F4 1 32, as determined for the empty CC3α host, to P1, but this does not alter the crystal packing of the CC3 molecules. IAST calculations are useful to suggest selectivity in a separation of two or more gases for an adsorptive separation process, but IAST does not accurately represent a gas mixture flowing through a packed bed of material. 58 In particular, IAST calculations say little about separation kinetics since the calculations are derived from singlecomponent gas sorption isotherms that are collected at thermodynamic equilibrium. Therefore, breakthrough experiments were carried out to establish the practical potential of CC3α for N 2 /SF 6 separations, and in particular to demonstrate that the SF 6 diffusion kinetics are sufficiently fast for real separations. All breakthrough experiments were performed at 298 K with a 90:10 (v/v) N 2 /SF 6 mixture. The breakthrough curves and desorption curves for N 2 and SF 6 flowing through a bed of CC3α are shown in Figure 7. Nitrogen breaks through the column within 1 minute, whereas SF 6 does not start to break through until after 6.5 minutes and does not completely break through until approximately 20 minutes. The large difference in breakthrough time between N 2 and SF 6 reflects the much higher affinity of CC3α towards SF 6 . The breakthrough curve for N 2 shows the characteristic 'roll-up' as the concentration at the outlet is temporarily higher than at the inlet as the SF 6 is preferentially adsorbed and displaces the N 2 . The desorption was performed by flowing helium through the column under the same conditions as for breakthrough. N 2 is desorbed quickly from the column, with 97 % of the gas being desorbed within the first minute. As expected, SF 6 is desorbed more slowly, with full desorption taking about 20 minutes, approximately the same time as for full breakthrough.The SF 6 isotherms for CC3α suggested excellent potential for SF 6 separation from nitrogen, and therefore the nitrogen isotherms were measured at equivalent temperatures (Fig. S2) to allow the calculation of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) predicted selectivity (Figs. 5, andS3). 57 The industrially relevant composition for separation of an SF 6 /N2 mixture is SF 6 :N2 = 10%:90%. 6,12 At 1 bar pressure CC3α gives a selectivity of 178 at 273 K, and 74 at 298 K).

        <p>Breakthrough and desorption curves for CC3α and zeolite 13X at three different gas flow rates are compared in Figures S5 and S6. In each case, the desorption of SF 6 from CC3 takes approximately the same time as the full breakthrough. However, for zeolite 13X with a 25 ml minute -1 flow rate, SF 6 desorption takes twice as long as it does to breakthrough (Figure S6). The more rapid desorption efficiency of CC3α therefore gives it a potential advantage over zeolite 13X as a material for N 2 /SF 6 separation. 59Breakthrough and desorption curves for CC3α and zeolite 13X at three different gas flow rates are compared in Figures S5 and S6.

        <p>Intrinsically porous molecules, as opposed to framework or network materials, have been investigated for SF 6 uptake separation. Despite the pore limiting diameters in CC3 being considerably narrower 36,52 than the 11 Å recommended as the optimum pore size by simulation, 60 this cage shows unprecedented selectivity for SF 6 over N 2 . Our simulations suggest this may be a result of the flexibility of the CC3 molecular crystal, which allows SF 6 to diffuse by cooperative effects, before the structure relaxes back to produce a closer, near-ideal interaction with the SF 6 guest. This hypothesis is further supported by research reported by Camp and Scholl while this manuscript was being written. 61 In that study, transition state theory methods were used to simulate the diffusion of various gases in CC3, and it was found for SF 6 that no diffusion would be expected in a static system, while diffusion should be possible if the flexibility of the host is taken into account. The IAST selectivity of CC3 for an industrially relevant mixture of 10:90 SF 6 :N 2 at 298 K and 1 bar is higher than other reported materials. Breakthrough experiments confirmed that CC3 is effective for separation of N 2 and SF 6 . Also, desorption curves show that SF 6 is more efficiently desorbed from CC3 than from zeolite 13X. Flexibility in MOFs has been found to provide higher gas capacities. 62 Similarly, the flexibility of molecular crystals, such as CC3, allows for a stronger gas binding with SF 6 , which gives these materials potential for practical gas separations under flow.Intrinsically porous molecules, as opposed to framework or network materials, have been investigated for SF 6 uptake separation.
