        <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have revolutionized the aircraft industry in this decade. UAVs are now capable of carrying out remote sensing, remote monitoring, courier delivery, and a lot more. A lot of research is happening on making UAVs more robust using energy harvesting techniques to have a better battery lifetime, network performance and to secure against attackers. UAV networks are many times used for unmanned missions. There have been many attacks on civilian, military, and industrial targets that were carried out using remotely controlled or automated UAVs. This continued misuse has led to research in preventing unauthorized UAVs from causing damage to life and property. In this paper, we present a literature review of UAVs, UAV attacks, and their prevention using anti-UAV techniques. We first discuss the different types of UAVs, the regulatory laws for UAV activities, their use cases, recreational, and military UAV incidents. After understanding their operation, various techniques for monitoring and preventing UAV attacks are described along with case studies.Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have revolutionized the aircraft industry in this decade.

        <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are becoming popular and are being used for various applications at an accelerating rate [1,2]. UAVs are deployed across various sectors including logistics [3,4], agriculture [5], remote sensing [6], wireless hotspot services [7], smart city applications [8] and disaster management [9]. Notably, UAVs are being used for crowd surveillance, public announcements, and sanitizing public places to help in managing the COVID-19 pandemic [10]. Techniques are also being developed to employ legitimate UAVs for tracking and surveillance of suspicious UAVs [11]. According to the latest Goldman Sachs report, by 2020 there would be 7.8 million consumer UAV shipments and USD 3.3 billion in revenue, versus only 450,000 shipments and USD 700 million in revenue in 2014 in the commercial UAV segment [12]. The market is anticipated to register a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 56.5% from now till 2025 [13]. UAVs are expected to play a huge role in upcoming 5G networks by supporting flexible deployment and backhaul connectivity operations [14,15]. Blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies are expected to enable trusted and transparent sharing of UAVs across different commercial enterprises [16][17][18][19][20]. UAVs are also being used for various military applications such as surveillance, target tracking, air-to-ground combat among many others. The US military spending on UAVs is estimated to be around USD 17 billion from 2017 to 2021 [12]. For such critical applications, the security of wireless UAV-UAV and ground-UAV communications is a must. Security schemes and techniques to ensure essential security features such as mutual authentication and privacy protection, and methods to analyze security vulnerabilities in UAV networks are also being developed [21][22][23][24][25][26]. There is little doubt that UAVs will play a crucial role in our future societies.Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are becoming popular and are being used for various applications at an accelerating rate [1,2].

        <p>Despite all the advantages of UAVs, they are not free from security vulnerabilities. Even professional UAVs, which are used for critical and sensitive applications such as police operations and enemy surveillance have been shown to possess several security vulnerabilities [27]. When compromised, they can be used by criminals and terrorist organizations for illegal surveillance and unmanned attacks. They may be turned off remotely, hijacked, flown away or stolen. [28]. Recent incidents of UAV attacks provide an indication of how devastating they can be. Take, for example, the attack on Saudi Arabia's biggest oil refinery, Saudi Aramco. In this attack, UAVs targeted one of Saudi Aramco's facilities and successfully damaged it declining the production by about 5.7 million barrels of oil a day which is about 5 percent of the global production of oil [29]. All this clearly indicates the need for Anti-UAV technologies.Despite all the advantages of UAVs, they are not free from security vulnerabilities.

        <p>Anti-UAV refers to the process of prevention of potential UAV attacks by either capturing the UAV or jamming its communication channel to disrupt its flight pattern, possibly bring it to a halt on the ground. In this paper, we present a literature review of various anti-UAV techniques. This paper is structured such that we first analyze the classification of UAVs in order to better understand the methods of attacking UAVs. Then we present case studies of deliberate UAV attacks to get more insights into how the UAVs caused damage and how it could have been prevented. Next, we present methods of monitoring UAVs and successively counterattacking them including jamming their communication networks, neutralizing their autopilot software, and more. An overview of the outline of this paper is shown in Figure 1.Anti-UAV refers to the process of prevention of potential UAV attacks by either capturing the UAV or jamming its communication channel to disrupt its flight pattern, possibly bring it to a halt on the ground.

        <p>As UAV technology is advancing, it has become easily approachable and affordable. Many recreational and commercial UAV pilots are entering the commercial sectors where UAVs are extensively used (e.g., real estate, film making, journalism). As the ecosystem of UAVs is evolving quickly, many countries have come up with laws to regulate the usage of UAVs for various kinds of users. The regulations have evolved with advancements in UAV technology. Certain countries have established certification authorities to certify the usage of a UAV in their air space. In this section, we provide an overview of UAV regulations in various countries as of September 2020.As UAV technology is advancing, it has become easily approachable and affordable.

Some of the major manufacturers of UAVs in the field are DJI, Yuneec, Parrot, and Sensefly. Table 4 presents a list of popular UAVs and their specifications. Unfortunately, unlike military UAVs, these solutions do not always undergo vigorous security testing, because the implementation of security features increases the product development time and costs, thereby decreasing revenue for the manufacturing company. Additionally, enhanced security measures might make it difficult for general consumers to operate the UAV. The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem has its own set of security challenges [41][42][43]. There is a possibility that UAV-IoT ecosystems providing aerial IoT services [44] might inherit the same security challenges. Several security vulnerabilities like the possibility of hijacking, jamming of a UAV in flight, disabling the UAV, etc. have been reported for many of the popular UAVs available in the market [45]. Since the vulnerabilities are publicly available, this type of UAVs has a high possibility of misuse. Cyber attacks on industrial facilities are not very uncommon [46].

        <p>Generally, hobby-level UAVs (Micro and Small UAVs, Section 2.1) have 0.3 to 2 kg of payload capacity. These UAVs can carry a payload, which can be lethal objects like explosives and biological hazards. Even the UAV itself can be rammed into objects to cause damage. Although various countries have set up regulations to prevent such misuses, their enforcement is difficult. In many cases, it may not be possible to identify the owner or UAV operator who may have been operating the UAV from a remote location. Hence, having anti-UAV systems, which are discussed in Section 9, are very important and need to be widely deployed.Generally, hobby-level UAVs (Micro and Small UAVs, Section 2.1) have 0.3 to 2 kg of payload capacity.

        <p>According to the United States National Inter-agency Fire Center, aerial firefighting efforts were shut down a minimum of nine times, and a minimum of twenty UAV incursions had hindered firefighting capabilities within the US from January to October in the year 2019. Even though a bill was passed in 2015 by the US legislature, allowing firefighters to neutralize UAVs that interrupted their efforts to handle fires, and also imposing and creating penalties for UAV pilots who interrupted with firefighters, the UAV appearances in such rescue operations have continued to exist [48].According to the United States National Inter-agency Fire Center, aerial firefighting efforts were shut down a minimum of nine times, and a minimum of twenty UAV incursions had hindered firefighting capabilities within the US from January to October in the year 2019.

        <p>Beyond firefighting efforts, UAVs are known to interfere with airport traffic. Despite being small, UAVs they can cause expensive disasters if they come in collision with a large aircraft. Collisions with an engine, wing or any part of an airplane can cause severe damage. In 2017, a small UAV collided with a commercial airplane flying towards Quebec City in Canada. Although the plane landed safely, this incident introduced concerns about the collisions between unmanned aerial vehicles with commercial aircraft, following which the regulation of UAVs has increased [49].Beyond firefighting efforts, UAVs are known to interfere with airport traffic.

        <p>There have been multiple instances where UAVs were used to deliver contraband like narcotics, ammunition, and cell phones into prisons by flying over the walls. In March 2019, a UAV along with contraband was discovered at the Collins Bay Institution correction facility in Ontario, Canada.

        <p>Two UAVs carrying explosives were detonated near Avenida Bolívar in Caracas, Venezuela where Nicolás Maduro, the President of Venezuela was giving commemorations in the middle of a speech to the Bolivarian National Guard on August 4, 2018. The UAVs were reported to be the DJI M600 model loaded with C4 plastic explosives and gun powder. Though the president was unharmed, some National Guard soldiers were injured. Later, a terrorist group made posts on social media claiming responsibility for the attack [58].

        <p>There are several basic modulation techniques such as frequency modulation, amplitude modulation and digital modulation. However, such modulation of the original message signal on a fixed carrier wave makes the resultant signal wave vulnerable to tampering and jamming. Such a modulated wave can also be demodulated by anyone to get the original message signal. Spread spectrum is a modulation technique which protects the message signal from interference, environmental noise,8cm jamming. It also ensures secure communication and reduces the probability of signal detection. In spread spectrum techniques, the original narrow-band message signal is modulated with an independent wide-band code signal. The resultant signal thus has a higher bandwidth and the original message signal is 'spread' over a wide range of frequencies. At the receiver end, the same wide-band code signal is used to 'de-spread' the transmitted signal to get back the original narrow-band message signal, as shown in Figure 7. In the following discussion, we briefly explain four major variants of spread spectrum techniques which are often used in wireless UAV communications: Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum, Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum, Time Hopping Spread Spectrum and Chirp Spread Spectrum.There are several basic modulation techniques such as frequency modulation, amplitude modulation and digital modulation.

        <p>DSSS is the most fundamental form of spread spectrum techniques. In this type, the message or signal wave is spread by modulation using a wide band code known as the Pseudo Noise (PN) code. This PN code consists of a radio pulse with a very short duration and thus higher bandwidth when compared to the signal wave. Figure 8 shows how the signal wave gets spread by the PN code.DSSS is the most fundamental form of spread spectrum techniques.

        <p>Spreading on the PN code results in the original signal wave getting distributed over a much wider range of frequency bands and causes the modulated signal to have a bandwidth almost identical to the PN code. The smaller the duration of the PN code, the larger the bandwidth over which the data signal gets modulated, and thus higher the system resistance to outside interference. DSSS systems generally employ an additional modulation through Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation or Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation. Phase shift keying is a modulation technique by which the data bits are expressed as phases in the signal wave. BPSK expresses each 0 or 1 in the data as 0 • or 180 • phase shifts in the carrier wave, respectively, whereas in QPSK two bits are considered at once and expressed as 0 • , 90 • , 180 • or 270 • phase shifts. To summarize, in DSSS the data signal first gets modulated with the PN code followed by phase shift keying over a carrier wave.Spreading on the PN code results in the original signal wave getting distributed over a much wider range of frequency bands and causes the modulated signal to have a bandwidth almost identical to the PN code.

        <p>In FHSS communication systems the data signal is modulated onto a carrier signal, whose frequency is rapidly switched among different channels. A pseudo-random sequence generator passes a sequence to a frequency table that selects the frequency of the carrier wave. This frequency is then passed to a frequency synthesizer that generates the carrier wave of mentioned frequency, thereby facilitating switching of the carrier wave. This pseudo-random sequence generator is known to both the sender and the receiver. Hence, as the carrier wave frequency keeps switching, interference in a particular frequency segment affects the overall transmission for a very short duration.In FHSS communication systems the data signal is modulated onto a carrier signal, whose frequency is rapidly switched among different channels.

        <p>Additionally, FHSS systems generally employ M-ary Frequency Shift keying (MFSK) modulation technique. In MFSK, each channel is divided into M tones or smaller segments. In an FHSS/MFSK system, log 2 M data bits are used to modulate the carrier frequency which is pseudorandomly decided. When the carrier wave frequency changes faster than the MFSK tone, it is known as fast FHSS and when the carrier wave frequency changes slower than MFSK tone, it known as slow FHSS.Additionally, FHSS systems generally employ M-ary Frequency Shift keying (MFSK) modulation technique.

        <p>Figure 9 presents a signal flow diagram for FHSS/MFSK systems and Figure 10 shows how the frequency band is segmented in case of slow FHSS.

        <p>In THSS, the input signal is not sent continuously. Instead, it is broken into fragments and sent in pulses and 2 k discrete pulses are used as carrier signals to transmit k bits/pulse. A transmission window of duration x is divided into n segments and the signal is sent in one of the n segments (which varies with time). Figure 11 presents the discrete signal pulses, over a period of time. The resistance to interference is achieved by randomly varying the transmission time by pseudo-randomly changing the carrier pulse period and duty cycle. In a strict sense, time hopping in itself does not introduce any spread spectrum characteristics. Hence it is generally used in the hybrid spread spectrum with FHSS.In THSS, the input signal is not sent continuously.

        <p>CSS, unlike DSSS or FHSS, does not employ any pseudo-code generator. Instead, CSS relies on its unique way for varying the frequency of the carrier wave used for spectrum spread.

        <p>The basic idea behind this is that by increasing the bandwidth of the signal we are making it inefficient for a malicious jammer to interfere with the signal. Since there is limited power in the hands of a jammer, it will have to distribute the fixed power for transmission of the interference over a wide range of frequencies, thus introducing very little interference in a particular section of the signal. On the other hand, if the jammer transmits all its power on a particular section of the signal, the rest of the signal remains free of any interference.The basic idea behind this is that by increasing the bandwidth of the signal we are making it inefficient for a malicious jammer to interfere with the signal.

        <p>As the complexity of operations performed using UAVs increases, many tasks are being offloaded to the onboard flight controller. In the case of a partially autonomous system, the controller takes care of the low-level tasks of the mission such as collision detection and altitude control. The high-level mission constraints and parameters such as waypoints are controlled by a human operator. Thus, instead of human or manual control, the system uses different sensors such as inertial measurement units, pressure sensors, etc. to determine the current state of the system and maintain porperties such as altitude of the UAV. On the other hand, a fully autonomous system application would involve a completely autonomous execution of the mission, without necessarily involving the transmission/reception of RF signals to/from the ground station. A typical example would involve a pre-programmed flight route.As the complexity of operations performed using UAVs increases, many tasks are being offloaded to the onboard flight controller.

        <p>This type of communication method involves a human operating a radio transmitter/receiver, a smartphone, a tablet or a computer as a ground station to control the flight path of the UAV. UAVs using this type of communication can fly only in the line of sight of the operator, and hence, these types of UAVs are generally short-ranged.This type of communication method involves a human operating a radio transmitter/receiver, a smartphone, a tablet or a computer as a ground station to control the flight path of the UAV.

        <p>This type of communication involves UAVs communicating with a GNSS system. UAVs using this type of communication are generally long-ranged. A very common GNSS system is GPS. GPS navigation is provided using more than 30 satellites continuously revolving in their fixed orbits around the earth. Each satellite has a stable atomic clock which is synchronized with others and to a base station which updates the time with respect to the ground. For knowing the position accurately, a signal from at least 4 satellites needs to be received. The navigational message includes the Almanac data and Ephemeris data. The Ephemeris data has information regarding the location and time of each satellite in the orbit. Almanac message include data regarding the entire constellation of satellites.Hence, these messages from satellites are used by the GNSS receiver to find its location and time using the trilateration method.This type of communication involves UAVs communicating with a GNSS system.

        <p>Transmission (Tx) protocols are implemented in the wireless communication between the transmitter and the receiver. A transmission protocol is defined by the structure of its data packets, and the type of spread spectrum and encryption scheme it uses. Some major UAV manufacturers implement the same protocols across all of their UAVs. These are of utmost concern for the security analysis of a UAV. Some of the most popular Tx protocols include MAVLink, Digital Signal Modulation (DSM), Automated Frequency Hopping Digital System (AFHDS) and Futaba Advanced Spread Spectrum Technology (FASST).

        <p>The Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) Link protocol is a very lightweight messaging protocol used to carry telemetry, and to command and control multiple UAVs. 
            <rs type="software">MAVLink</rs> follows a modern hybrid publish-subscribe and point-to-point design pattern. In the publisher-subscribe model, we have a central broker that manages various topics to which clients either subscribe (listen to messages) or publish (pass messages). When a particular message is published on a topic, all subscribers receive that message. On the other hand, in the point-to-point model, messages are sent directly between the sender and the receiver. Therefore, in MAV-Link, data streams are sent/published as topics whereas configuration sub-protocols such as the mission protocol or parameter protocol are point-to-point protocols with re-transmission. It has two versions: 
            <rs type="software">MAVLink</rs> v1.0 and 
            <rs type="software">MAVLink</rs> 2.0. MavLink v2.0 was widely adopted in 2017 and is the main focus of our discussion.
        </p>
        <p>Figure 14 presents the packet structure used in 
            <rs type="software">MAVLink</rs>
            <rs type="version">2.0</rs>. The data packet has just 14 bytes of overhead as shown in Figure 14 [85]. The start-of-text (STX) marker is used to indicate the beginning of a new packet. The sequence ID is used to detect packet loss as successive messages have successive IDs. It employs X.25 CRC as a checksum to verify data integrity. A checksum is a datum calculated based on a specific block of data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage. The protocol defines 1-byte fields for the source device ID and source component ID. The target device ID and target component ID are optional and can be specified in the message payload to indicate where the message should be sent/routed. In the end, there is an optional signature field of 13 bytes to ensure that the link is tamper-proof and ensures endpoint authenticity. The signature has 3 fields linkID, timestamp and a unique sign:
        </p>
        <p>• linkID (8 bits) -Each link has an ID in the MavLink protocol. LinkID id this just this ID and is usually same as the channel. • timestamp (48 bits) -The timestamp has a unit of 10 microseconds and it monotonically increases for every message on a particular link. • sign (48 bits) -The sign is extracted from the start of the SHA-256 hash of the complete packet without the sign itself but including the timestamp appended to the secret key. The secret key is 32 bytes of binary data stored on both ends of a MAVLink channel.• linkID (8 bits) -Each link has an ID in the MavLink protocol. LinkID id this just this ID and is usually same as the channel. • timestamp (48 bits) -The timestamp has a unit of 10 microseconds and it monotonically increases for every message on a particular link. • sign (48 bits) -The sign is extracted from the start of the SHA-256 hash of the complete packet without the sign itself but including the timestamp appended to the secret key.

        <p>The Spektrum DSM2 technology operates in the 2.4GHz band and uses wideband DSSS. DSM2 uses DuaLink technology that is based on the use of two channels. The DualLink technology assists recovery from polarization blind spots and reflected signal fading. Upon switching on, the DSM2 based transmitter scans for two free channels in the 2.4GHz band. On finding them, the transmitter transmits it's distinct Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) in these channels. Subsequently, on receiving the GUID, the receiver locks on to these two free channels [87]. In case one of the channels is noisy, the other channel acts as a backup. This lowers the chance of disconnection of the signal significantly. However, if both channels become unusable, the connection might be lost [88]. Hence, the DSM2 signal provides additional resistance to noise, interference and other transmitters transmitting on the same frequency.The Spektrum DSM2 technology operates in the 2.4GHz band and uses wideband DSSS.

        <p>The Flysky Automatic Frequency Hopping Digital System (AFHDS) is a digital protocol that ensures two or more transmitters can operate at the same time without interfering with each other's respective communication. AFHDS 2A is the second generation of the system that added duplex communication capability and telemetry capabilities [90]. AFHDS-2A supports up to 14 channels and requires manual-binding. It offers options to change the reception (Rx) protocol for the receiver, servo frequency, the Link Quality Indicator output(an indication of the quality of the data packets received by the receiver based on the receiver signal strength), and the fine-tuning of the operational frequency [91]. AFHDS 3 is the latest generation of the protocol and allows automatic frequency hops in the range of 2.402GHz to 2.481GHz. However, depending on the outcome of the initial transmitter-receiver pairing, the frequencies actually in use and hopping algorithm change. Moreover, each time the system is powered on, the frequencies and hopping algorithm change as a security measure.The Flysky Automatic Frequency Hopping Digital System (AFHDS) is a digital protocol that ensures two or more transmitters can operate at the same time without interfering with each other's respective communication.

        <p>Radar-based techniques are usable in the case of partial or completely autonomous UAVs where no radio communication takes place. For detection by radar, generally, radio waves are transmitted, which on reflection from an object undergo reflection and change in properties such as polarization. Based on the properties of received signals like the Doppler effect and polarisation of the received radio waves, information about the presence of an object can be calculated. Doppler radars are able to discard static objects and specifically track moving objects. Micro-Doppler radars are able to detect motion, specifically speed differences within moving objects. As UAVs have major moving parts like propellers which create a large spectrum of linear speed differences, this is a good approach. Millimeter-wave radars, ultra-wideband radars, and non line-of-sight radars are some of the applicable radar technologies [93,94].Radar-based techniques are usable in the case of partial or completely autonomous UAVs where no radio communication takes place.

Besides these, fundamental audio processing approaches such as audio fingerprinting may also be used [105]. It is also possible to track the position of UAVs by using multiple microphones with methods like triangulation.</p>

        <p>Based on the mode of operation (i.e., manual, full, and partially autonomous), different situations necessitate different approaches for neutralization. For a manual or semi-autonomous UAV, the RF radio communication between the ground station and UAV happens over various protocols with fixed packet structure. These packets can be intercepted and decoded to obtain the packet architecture and hence a spoofing attack can be launched. RF jammers which transmit large amounts of energy towards the UAV can also be used for disrupting communication. This can lead to the UAV activating its fail-safe which may be to make a safe landing in its current position, return to a preset base location, or fly haphazardly and crash. For an autonomous UAV, the sensor values can be corrupted. The GNSS signals specifically can be jammed as well as spoofed. Besides these, there are some other physical attacks that are possible as well. Figure 16 presents a table listing all the techniques discussed in this section. Additionally, a Table 12 reviews some of the state of the art solutions against UAVs avaiable in the industry.Based on the mode of operation (i.e., manual, full, and partially autonomous), different situations necessitate different approaches for neutralization.

        <p>In the case of RF radio communication between the UAV and the ground control, RF jamming techniques are used to increase the level of noise interference at the RF receiver, in this case, the UAV or the UAV. This reduces the SNR at the receiver. This in turn prevents the receiver from responding to the commands from the sender, and thus, neutralizes its operation. Hence, the signals from the pilot or satellite systems can be jammed to disrupt the operation of manual and autonomous UAVs that depend on these. However, some UAVs that operate solely using other sensors such as IMUs and cameras are immune to this jamming technique.In the case of RF radio communication between the UAV and the ground control, RF jamming techniques are used to increase the level of noise interference at the RF receiver, in this case, the UAV or the UAV.

        <p>Also known as Barrage Jamming, it is the simplest form of jamming in which a noise signal is applied to a small portion or the entire spectrum of the wideband modulated signal. This form of jamming directly affects and reduces the channel capacity of the system. It reduces the SNR value at the receiver, thereby reducing the channel capacity and increasing the information error rate. Noise jamming affects FHSS systems especially by introducing background interference during clock synchronization and tracking that is required between the sender and the receiver in between every transmission.

        <p>In this type of jamming one or more tones in the spectrum are jammed strategically to introduce interference. The jamming performance depends on the placement of the tones in the spectrum and the transmission power. The transmission power is directly proportional to the interference on the tone.

        <p>Tone jamming can be of two types: either on a single tone (monotone) or on multiple tones (multi-tone). Both perform poorly against FHSS systems due to the variable nature of the transmission spectrum. Monotone jamming performs poorly since the overall performance of the system is not affected by one channel being absent. Even in multitone jamming, to be able to introduce significant interference, the adversary has to jam enough channels in the spectrum. The performance of single-tone jamming against DSSS systems has been analyzed in [113] and compared against narrow-band barrage jamming. With the correct placement of the tone, tone jamming performs fairly well against DSSS systems.

        <p>In swept jamming, a relatively narrow-band signal, sometimes even a pulse or tone, is scanned in time across the frequency spectrum of interest. At a particular time instant, only a single frequency is targeted. However, over a period of time, the jammer covers a range of frequency bands by sweeping the target frequency. Hence, it is a mixture of noise and tone jamming in its application. Similar to noise jamming, it focuses on a single tone, but by sweeping, it also emulates tone jamming. Unlike noise or tone jamming, sweeping the jamming waveform ensures that it covers the entire set of hop frequencies of the data signal in the entire spectrum.

        <p>A follower jammer always tries to locate the new frequency hop that an FHSS system went to and then locates the target signal. Once confirmed, it then tries to jam the located frequency. To locate the target FHSS system frequency, it requires that the jammer measure the spectrum for energy losses and gains. An energy gain in the spectrum indicates a new signal entering whereas energy loss indicates a signal leaving the band. However, even then it is important to accurately identify whether a particular energy variation corresponds to the target signal or not, for which analysis needs to be carried out [116].A follower jammer always tries to locate the new frequency hop that an FHSS system went to and then locates the target signal.

        <p>The autonomous UAV auto-pilot application relies heavily on the onboard sensors such as LIDARs, SONARs and optical flow sensors for localization and navigation. These sensors interact with the environment and provide valuable data for the auto-pilot computer to optimally guide the autonomous UAV system. In a sensor spoofing attack, the attacker transmits false sensor values to the flight controller which are in contrast to the actual values. The feedback loops get triggered and in order to correct the destabilized false values, the UAV orients itself to stabilize, which in turn destabilizes it. Since many sensors share data for actuation, this can even lead to complete loss of control of the system, since one can gain access to the on-board actuator sensors or simulate false values.

        <p>In contrast to jamming which involves bombarding the receiver with noise signals, spoofing involves the generation of plausible counterfeit input signals with enough power to fool the receiver into believing this to be the original legitimate signal. Spoofing of the Tx protocol is difficult and requires reverse engineering to understand the structure. GPS signals tend to fluctuate in power due to the position of the satellites in the space as well as the weather conditions. Most modern-day GPS receivers implement an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) to compensate for these widespread fluctuations in the GPS signal strength. However, this also leaves the system more vulnerable to spoofing attacks [128]. A fake GNSS signal can be broadcast in an area making the UAV in that area perceive as if it is located in a different position, giving virtual control of the UAV to the spoofer [129,130].In contrast to jamming which involves bombarding the receiver with noise signals, spoofing involves the generation of plausible counterfeit input signals with enough power to fool the receiver into believing this to be the original legitimate signal.

        <p>Spoofing can be achieved simply by meaconing which involves the interception and re-transmission of the original signal with higher power to the receiver. It is the preferable vector when the targeted signals are encrypted since it does not rely on reverse-engineering the signal. In case of military bands, it is difficult to implement such an attack since retransmitting the signals need costly resources due to the much larger PN modulation and difficulty to predict the frequency hop pattern. However, in 2011, Iranian military captured a Lockheed Martin produced RQ-170 sentinel UAV using meaconing, among various other techniques [131].Spoofing can be achieved simply by meaconing which involves the interception and re-transmission of the original signal with higher power to the receiver.

        <p>Similar to meaconing, it is used in systems where the GPS signal is protected with cryptography. In this attack, each symbol of the secret code is separately estimated by observing the received signal in the corresponding symbol interval. The symbol estimate is continuously updated by observing the received signal and simultaneously used in the spoofed signal, trying to replicate the secret code as faithfully as possible. Then, the spoofed signal is sent with some delay to the original signal.

            <rs type="software">SkyJack</rs>'s developer, Samy Kamkar, used a Raspberry Pi with a WiFi Packet injector installed with 
            <rs type="software">SkyJack</rs> to hack an AR Parrot 2 drone in 2015. The AR Parrot 2, like its predecessor, works over WiFi and can be controlled by a smartphone or tablet. The AR Parrot 2 hosts its wireless network which is how the pilot of the UAV connects. 
            <rs type="software">SkyJack</rs> first runs aircrack-ng (open source) to run monitor mode to find the UAVs and UAV owners in its vicinity. The MAC addresses of the UAVs owned by the Parrot company can be detected over any wireless connections from MAC addresses as they can be found online in the IEEE Registration Authority's organizationally unique identifiers. After that aireplay-ng (open source) is used to de-authenticate the actual pilot of the UAV. Once unauthenticated, the attacker can connect as the UAV is not connected to any pilot. Finally, node-ar-drone is used to control the newly enslaved UAV via Javascript and node.js [140]. 
            <rs type="software">SkyJack</rs> does have its limitations, however, since it can only select targets within a predefined range of MAC addresses on an unsecured network.

        <p>A Software Defined Radio along with an Open Source GPS-SDR-SIM repository is used to broadcast fake GPS signals [141]. The attacker supplies a GPS broadcast Ephemeris file for specifying the GPS satellite constellation. The Ephemeris files are used to generate the simulated pseudo-range and Doppler for the GPS satellites in view. After this, the simulated range data is used to generate the digitized I/Q samples for the GPS signal. Further, the SDR converts the I/Q to RF waves which are received as stronger signals than the real GPS by the UAV. Almost all UAVs that are dependent on GPS are vulnerable to this kind of attack owing to the very nature of unencrypted civilian GPS signals.A Software Defined Radio along with an Open Source GPS-SDR-SIM repository is used to broadcast fake GPS signals [141].

        <p>In February 2020, students at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras designed a UAV that can detect other UAVs visually, along with a GPS spoofing mechanism for neutralizing the operation of GPS dependent UAVs in the vicinity. It uses a deep learning model to detect motion in order to spot other UAVs even in the absence of light. It also uses an SDR approach to broadcast stronger GPS signals for GPS spoofing. Mathematical models of the time differences with the target UAV are used to generate the spoofed GPS packets. With multiple time differences, eventually the target UAV calibrated its clock to the spoofed signals. When there is a large variance in the actual GPS position and spoofed position, the target UAV's fail-safe is activated that disrupts its operation. This was tested against various civilian GPS receivers used in the UAV industry such as Ublox and DJI in-house GNSS. The students were able "to take down the UAVs almost instantaneously" [144].In February 2020, students at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras designed a UAV that can detect other UAVs visually, along with a GPS spoofing mechanism for neutralizing the operation of GPS dependent UAVs in the vicinity.

        <p>The Parrot Bebop was tested against various attacks by a research [141] GPS Spoofing Laptop with SDR kit Parrot Bebop [142] Buffer overflow, denial of service and ARP cache poisoning Laptop with WiFi Support UAV using Digi XBee 868LP [143] Reverse engineering and spoofingThe Parrot Bebop was tested against various attacks by a research [141] GPS Spoofing Laptop with SDR kit Parrot Bebop [142] Buffer overflow, denial of service and ARP cache poisoning Laptop with WiFi Support UAV using Digi XBee 868LP [143] Reverse engineering and spoofing</p>
        <p>Laptop and Digi XBee 868LP team and they were able to discover three vulnerabilities [142]. The first is a denial of service attack where about 1000 requests were made to the UAV rapidly, each trying to connect as controller. The UAV's processor and memory could not handle this and therefore, it shut down. This sent the UAV into what the team referred to as "an uncontrolled landing". Next, a buffer overflow attack where a very large data packet was transmitted to the UAV, which exceeded the maximum capacity of the buffer in the system. This also caused the UAV to crash. Lastly, fake packets claiming the sender to be the UAV's controller were sent repeatedly from a laptop. This claim was made by spoofing the IP address. Soon the UAV accepted the sender as hence its own contact with UAV was severed. This led to an emergency landing of the UAV.Laptop and Digi XBee 868LP team and they were able to discover three vulnerabilities [142].

        <p>The Digi XBee 868LP RF Modules provide wireless connectivity to end-point devices in mesh networks. It was used for telemetry between the UAV and ground station for a UAV, which was exploited by Nils Rodday and presented in the Black Hat Asia Conference 2016 [143]. By referring to the instruction manual of the chip, an API mode was discovered which allowed the user to fabricate their own custom packets for transmission. A broadcast mode was also discovered which allowed pinging all chips in the range and getting their addresses from acknowledgments. The chip also had a feature where its address, used for packet transmission, can be changed remotely by another chip. Hence, the attacker introduced another chip in the system besides the ones in the ground station and UAV, switched to API mode, and then broadcast to get the addresses of the GS and UAV chips. After that, he modified the addresses such that all packet were sent through the attacker chip. Hence, he got access to reading and writing information on the channel but was still unaware of the data packet structure. For this, he reverse-engineered the 
            <rs type="software">Android</rs> application in the GS and then used trial and error to list all operation packets. After getting the templates, he could rebroadcast those packet to spoof itself as the UAV GS.

        <p>UAV misuse has led to the formation of regulations and regulatory bodies in various countries. So, in this paper, we highlighted the need for research and implementation of measures to counteract the misuse of UAVs. Having provided the current situation of UAVs from a security perspective, the current global scenario of UAVs in the military and commercial usage, existing regulations in various countries, we reviewed and discussed popular transmitter protocols and presented some detecting and neutralizing methods for UAVs. We emphasized the RF communication used by the UAV as it seems to be the most reliable method which can be deployed on a wide scale, owing to new technologies like SDRs, which reduce the cost dramatically. In the latter part, we presented case studies that specifically talk about how different kinds of commercial UAVs can be hacked and thus can be misused. With the growing popularity of UAVs in various fields, UAVs are soon going to be employed in our day to day life and there is a need for research addressing all the security concerns to accelerate this process securely.UAV misuse has led to the formation of regulations and regulatory bodies in various countries.
