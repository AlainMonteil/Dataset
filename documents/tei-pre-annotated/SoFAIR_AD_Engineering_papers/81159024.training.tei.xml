        <p>Additive manufacturing and digital fabrication bring new horizons to concrete and cementbased material construction. 3D printing inspired construction techniques that have recently been developed at laboratory scale for cement-based materials. This study aims to investigate the role of the structural build-up properties of cement-based materials in such a layer by layer construction technique. As construction progresses, the cement-based materials become harder with time. The mechanical strength of the cement-based materials must be sufficient to sustain the weight of the layers subsequently deposited. It follows that the comparison of the mechanical strength, which evolves with time (i.e. structural buildup), with the loading due to layers subsequently deposited, can be expected to provide the optimal rate of layer by layer construction. A theoretical framework has been developed to propose a method of optimization of the building rate, which is experimentally validated in a layer-wise built column.Additive manufacturing and digital fabrication bring new horizons to concrete and cementbased material construction. 3D printing inspired construction techniques that have recently been developed at laboratory scale for cement-based materials.

        <p>Various techniques have been developed in recent years; for example, smart dynamic casting is a result of a combination of slipforming and digital fabrication techniques [1,3]. Another family of concrete digital manufacturing has been inspired by the 3D printing technique [4]. This technique is commonly called 'additive manufacturing' and consists of joining materials to produce objects, layer upon layer, from 3D model data. Examples of such techniques belonging to this family of digital-aided construction are the ''Concrete printing'' process developed at Loughborough University [5][6][7][8][9] and the ''Contour Crafting'' method [10,11] developed at the University of Southern California.Various techniques have been developed in recent years; for example, smart dynamic casting is a result of a combination of slipforming and digital fabrication techniques [1,3].

        <p>One way of additive manufacturing in construction of concrete is to combine concrete extrusion with digital fabrication techniques. As noted in [1], the objective is a scaling-up of a desktop 3D printer to the size of a building site. At this time such techniques are not sufficiently developed for industrial application but have succeeded in producing wall elements under laboratory conditions [7,8,10].One way of additive manufacturing in construction of concrete is to combine concrete extrusion with digital fabrication techniques.

        <p>Nevertheless, additive manufacturing extrusion technique can be developed into a very efficient and robust construction technique at an industrial scale. To achieve this end and optimize the process, two major constraints need to be overcome [1]: Firstly the bonding between the layers which is a weakness in the printed structure. It is worth noting that the bonding strength decreases with the time gap between layers [8]. The second constraint is the monitoring of the material hardening over time: The material must be hard enough to sustain the weight of the subsequently deposited layers. This constraint may lead to a prolonged production time.Nevertheless, additive manufacturing extrusion technique can be developed into a very efficient and robust construction technique at an industrial scale.

        <p>The juxtaposition of these two constraints confronts us with a paradox concerning the production rate of this process. The time gap between two deposited layers must be sufficiently long to provide adequate mechanical strength capable of sustaining the weight of the subsequently deposited layers and also short enough to ensure both optimized bonding strength and building rate.The juxtaposition of these two constraints confronts us with a paradox concerning the production rate of this process.

        <p>It therefore appears that the optimized time gap between layers should be the shortest that allows the stability of the structure during construction. Such optimized time gap brings the highest bonding strength and building rate compatible with a stable structure of deposited fresh concrete.It therefore appears that the optimized time gap between layers should be the shortest that allows the stability of the structure during construction.

        <p>The ability of the deposited layers to sustain its own weight is linked to its rheology and more particularly to its yield stress [3,7]. During the layer by layer building of a wall, the first deposited layer undergoes the heaviest load. In order to ensure the wall stability during the process, the yield stress must be sufficient to sustain this load. At this point, a new paradox appears: the paste must be sufficiently fluid for extrusion purpose [12] but sufficiently firm for the structure mechanical stability. A way around this paradox is to use the structural build-up of the concrete to ensure both, sufficient fluidity during extrusion and stability after deposit. The yield stress of cement-based materials increases over time at rest [13][14][15][16][17][18][19]; this reversible behaviour is due to the nucleation of cement grains at their contact point by CSH formation during the dormant period before the setting time [20]. This yield stress increase is commonly modelled using a linear relationship with resting time [15] during the first hour of rest. Recently, Perrot et al. have proposed an exponential relationship that describes the yield stress increase up to the setting time [21]. It has been shown that the structural build-up properties of cement-based materials can be used to predict or optimize concrete production. For instance, formwork pressure reduction or distinct-layer casting issues can be predicted using the structural build-up rate of self-compacting concrete [21][22][23][24]. In the present case, structural build-up is used to describe and model the competition between the load increase, linked to the building rate, and the mechanical strength of the first deposited layer of the structure which is linked to the cement-based material yield stress. The aim of this paper is to propose a model that predicts the structure failure (or stability) during the additive manufacturing process of a concrete structure.

        <p>In the first part of the paper, a theoretical framework is developed for structural build-up of cement-based materials and load due to 3D printing is proposed. Experimental tests are then carried out on a firm paste to simulate the loading due to the printing of a concrete column. Finally, the comparison between both the theoretical framework and the experimental results highlights the finding that structural build-up must be taken into account in additive manufacturing extrusion technique in order to find the highest acceptable building rate.In the first part of the paper, a theoretical framework is developed for structural build-up of cement-based materials and load due to 3D printing is proposed.

        <p>Many studies on digital fabrication techniques have shown that the building rate of the structure influences the success of the process [1,3,7]. For additive manufacturing exturion technique, Le et al. [7] defines an open time (linked to the Vicat setting time), to describe the change of the concrete workability with time. This parameter is likely to affect what the authors called ''buildability,'' which consists of quantifying the number of filament layers that could be built up without noticeable deformation of lower layers.Many studies on digital fabrication techniques have shown that the building rate of the structure influences the success of the process [1,3,7].

It is then necessary to model both the evolution of the mechanical strength of the cement-based material before hydration (which is governed by the material yield stress) and the evolution in time of the mechanical load due to the building of the structure. The developed theory must be able to indicate if the layered structure is able to sustain its own weight and able to predict the failure time when the structure is going to collapse.The idea of this theoretical framework is to compare the mechanical strength of the bottom first deposited layer with the mechanical load due to the weight of the above-deposited layers, and then to model the so-called ''buildability'' defined in [7].

The concrete structural build-up is due to complex and coupled phenomena: flocculation due to colloidal interactions and CSH nucleation at the contact points between cement grains [16,20]. According to Roussel et al. [20], the flocculation process lasts only several tenths of seconds. After flocculation, at a timescale of several tenths of minutes, the structural build-up is due to the formation of CSH bridges between cement grains at the pseudo contact-points. The authors assumed that the rate of formation of CSH bridges is constant because the heat of hydration is constant during the so-called ''dormant'' period. Therefore, they conclude that, during this period, the increase of yield stress with time (or the elastic modulus) must be linear.where s 0,0 is the yield stress of the material with no time at rest.

        <p>After this linear increase period which lasts up to 60 min, the rate of yield stress increase speeds up [21,25,26]. It would therefore appear that there is a nonnegligible linear increase of the solid volume fraction which leads to an exponential increase in yield stress.After this linear increase period which lasts up to 60 min, the rate of yield stress increase speeds up [21,25,26].

        <p>To validate our theory, we simulate the load acting on a cylindrical sample (i.e. the first deposited layer) due to the layer by layer construction of a cylindrical column. The cylindrical sample was 35 mm high and has a diameter of 60 mm. The initial material yield stress was 4 kPa and was sufficient to provide adequate strength to overcome the gravitational effect; consequently, the fresh sample could sustain its own weight. The material yield stress was higher than those found in studies carried out at Loughborough University [5][6][7][8][9] (which were of the order of 1 kPa) but appeared to be in the range of material yield stress used for contour crafting [10,11] developed in University of Southern California.To validate our theory, we simulate the load acting on a cylindrical sample (i.e. the first deposited layer) due to the layer by layer construction of a cylindrical column.

        <p>The first issue to be discussed relates to sample failure detection. The combination of monitoring fracture onset with the recording of upper plate displacement provides collaborating evidence of sample plastification. Figure 2 shows the recorded displacement of the upper plate for time gap between each layer deposit of 11, 17, 22 and 34 s. For each time gap, the moment when fractures appear on the sample surface is reported (as shown in Fig. 3). It is considered that sample failure is reached when both phenomena have occurred: fracture onset at the surface and increase in the displacement rate. This detection of failure is supported by squeeze flow of semi-solid paste which undergoes fracture at the sample periphery [27,28,32,33]. It can be seen in It is also worth noting that before the change of slope and fracture onset, the displacement versus load curves are almost superimposed (Fig. 4). This superimposition provides additional evidence that before the change of slope, the behaviour of the sample is elastic and therefore no plastic flow has occurred.The first issue to be discussed relates to sample failure detection.

It can be seen in It is also worth noting that before the change of slope and fracture onset, the displacement versus load curves are almost superimposed (Fig. 4). This superimposition provides additional evidence that before the change of slope, the behaviour of the sample is elastic and therefore no plastic flow has occurred.</p>
        <p>Finally, we have chosen the fracture onset time as a failure indicator because it always occurred simultaneously with a change of the slope of the displacement, time curve.Finally, we have chosen the fracture onset time as a failure indicator because it always occurred simultaneously with a change of the slope of the displacement, time curve.</p>

        <p>As expected, Table 1 shows that the building rate monitors the stability the structure. The only sample that remains intact after the test is obtained for the smallest building rate R = 1.1 m/h. For higher building rate, all samples collapsed because of insufficient mechanical strength. In such cases, the material has not had time to become sufficiently stiff to sustain the weight of above deposited layers.As expected, Table 1 shows that the building rate monitors the stability the structure.

        <p>To go a step further, it would be interesting to predict the failure occurrence and time. As proposed in the theoretical framework, the comparison of the vertical stress with the critical stress, which is linked to the material strength, is expected to lead to a failure prediction. By plotting the evolution of both the vertical stress and the critical stress with time, as shown in Fig. 5, the time when the sample is going to plastically deform is easily identified. In this figure, the predicted time of failure is given by the intersection of the evolution of the vertical stress with the evolution of the critical stress. It is worth noting that the predicted failure time is in agreement with the experimentally observed failure time which is shown as solid circles in Fig. 5. Moreover, Fig. 5 shows that the critical stress is always higher than the vertical stress for a building rate of 1.1 m/h. This is in agreement with the experimental result which shows that the sample sustains the loading for this value of building rate. It therefore appears that the proposed theoretical framework is able to predict the success of the layerwise process of additive manufacturing. The framework provides an efficient tool to determine and optimise the building rate and therefore the bond strength between layers with the assurance of the structure stability.To go a step further, it would be interesting to predict the failure occurrence and time.

        <p>It is of interest to see if an analytical prediction of the failure can be made. Using the linear evolution of the yield stress provided by Roussel [15], a critical failure time t f can be easily expressed as follows:It is of interest to see if an analytical prediction of the failure can be made.

        <p>Fig. 4 Displacement of the upper plate applied load for time gap ranging from 11 to 60 s The computed failure time t f is shown on Fig. 5 by diagonal crosses. be seen that the f values are in agreement with experimental results except for those with the smallest building rates. This discrepancy in failure time is due to the fact that for the smallest building rate, the linear description of the yield stress evolution is no longer valid for process time higher than 1500 s (i.e. 25 min). Equation ( 6) is valid only for failure time lower than the critical time t c , which is given by Eq. ( 4) and predicts the time at which the linear model becomes inaccurate. If t f , calculated by Eq. ( 6), is greater than t c , the plot of the evolution of r v and r c with respect to time remains an effective solution to check structure stability. Furthermore, if the computed value of t f is of the order of the setting time of the concrete, the structure is expected to remains stable during additive manufacturing extrusion technique.Fig. 4 Displacement of the upper plate applied load for time gap ranging from 11 to 60 s The computed failure time t f is shown on Fig. 5 by diagonal crosses. be seen that the f values are in agreement with experimental results except for those with the smallest building rates.

        <p>In this study we have proposed a theoretical framework to find the highest building rate for layerwise concrete additive manufacturing extrusion technique inspired by 3D printing technologies. This theoretical framework is based on the comparison of the vertical stress acting on the first deposited layer with the critical stress related to plastic deformation that is linked to the material yield stress. Both stresses are time-dependent: the vertical stress depends on the building rate while the critical stress depends on the structural build-up of the concrete at rest. The developed framework consists of ensuring that the vertical stress does not exceed the critical stress.In this study we have proposed a theoretical framework to find the highest building rate for layerwise concrete additive manufacturing extrusion technique inspired by 3D printing technologies.
