        <p>Screen-printed electrochemical sensing platforms, due to their scales of economy and high reproducibility, can provide a useful approach to translate laboratory-based electrochemistry into the field. An important factor when utilising screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) is the determination of their real electrochemical surface area, which allows for the benchmarking of these SPEs and is an important parameter in quality control. In this paper, we consider the use of cyclic voltammetry and chronocoulometry to allow for the determination of the real electrochemical area of screen-printed electrochemical sensing platforms, highlighting to experimentalists the various parameters that need to be diligently considered and controlled in order to obtain useful measurements of the real electroactive area.Screen-printed electrochemical sensing platforms, due to their scales of economy and high reproducibility, can provide a useful approach to translate laboratory-based electrochemistry into the field.

        <p>Screen-printed electrochemical platforms form the basis of translating laboratory-based studies into industry for "in-the-field" experimentation. These platforms are fabricated on a large scale, resulting in low cost, yet highly reproducible sensors which can be used as either single-use (disposable) or can be readily modified via surface modification with enzymes, nanostructures, or even the bulk of the sensor can be adapted to allow bespoke applicability in a multitude of applications [1,2]. For example, Banks et al. [3,4] have shown that metal oxide (bismuth, antimony, and tin) bulk modified screen-printed electrodes can offer a suitable platform for the sensing of heavy metals. Additionally, screen-printed platforms have been utilized, both as-is (unmodified) and modified, within many sensing applications, for example, towards the detection of biomolecules (such as lactate [5] or L-cysteine [6]), gases (such as O 2 [7] or CO [8]), and metals (such as Sb and Sn [9]); with particular success within the food industry, a key indication of their quality and versatility, with respect to capsaicin [10] and garlic [11] which have been successfully analysed with screen-printed electrodes (SPEs). An important parameter to consider when utilising electrochemical sensors is the real electroactive area, especially within fundamental calculations of electrochemical processes, as well as providing a methodology for their benchmarking with respect to the quality control of SPEs.Screen-printed electrochemical platforms form the basis of translating laboratory-based studies into industry for "in-the-field" experimentation.

Electrochemical measurements were performed using an Autolab PGSTAT204 (Metrohm Autolab, Utrecht, The Netherlands) computer-controlled potentiostat. All measurements were conducted using a three-electrode system with a Pt wire counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) reference electrode, and screen-printed graphite working electrodes (SPEs) completing the circuit. The SPEs were fabricated in-house with appropriate stencil designs to achieve a 3.1 mm diameter working electrode, using a carbon-graphite ink (Product Ink: C2000802P2; Gwent Electronic Materials Ltd., Pontypool, UK) printed using a DEK 248 screen printer machine (DEK, Weymouth, UK) onto a polyester (Autostat, Milan, Italy, 250 micron thickness) flexible film. This layer was cured in a fan oven at 60 • C for 30 min and finally, a dielectric paste (Product Code: D2070423D5; Gwent Electronic Materials Ltd., Pontypool, UK) was then printed onto the polyester substrate to cover the connections. After a second curing process at 60 • C for 30 min, the SPEs are ready to be used. The in-house fabricated SPEs have been previously reported and characterized [26,27].

        <p>The electrode area of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) can be physically/visually determined with techniques such as scanning electron microscopy. In this case, the geometrical area, A geo , is determined through its physical dimensions, but there is no resemblance to the true electroactive area and there is no way of knowing which parts of the electrode surface are electrochemically active or indeed inactive. The most appropriate way is to use an interfacial technique such as electrochemistry; it is this approach that we consider herein.The electrode area of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) can be physically/visually determined with techniques such as scanning electron microscopy.

In this approach, typically, a reliable redox probe within an aqueous electrolyte is used to determine a plot of the forward peak current, I p,f , as a function of applied voltammetric scan rate (v 1/2 ). This is since the Randles-Ševćik equation is derived from assuming that the concentration of the electroactive species (in the bulk solution) is the same as that at the electrode surface, due to the development of the diffusion layer [32].where in all cases, n is the number of electrons in the electrochemical reaction, I p,f is the voltammetric current (analytical signal) using the forward peak of the electrochemical process, F is the Faraday constant (C mol -1 ), v is the applied voltammetric scan rate (V s -1 ), R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, A real is the electroactive area of the electrode (cm 2 ) and D is the diffusion coefficient (cm 2 s -1 ), α is the transfer coefficient (usually assumed to be close to 0.5), and n' is the number of electrons transferred before the rate determining step.

        <p>There are important factors to consider when utilising the aforementioned Randles-Ševćik (R-S) equations:There are important factors to consider when utilising the aforementioned Randles-Ševćik (R-S) equations:</p>
        <p>(1) Which equation should be used for each redox probe utilised? i.e., which equation from (1)- (3) is the most suitable to use? Analysis of the peak-to-peak separation (∆Ep) of the recorded voltammogram is useful, where in the reversible limit the ∆Ep is ~57mV and is independent of scan rate. In the case of quasi-and irreversible conditions, the ∆Ep is larger and is dependent upon the voltage scan rate. The wave-shape of the forward peak allows one to determine between reversible and irreversible conditions; a full analysis is given in reference [32]. (2) The R-S equations should only be used for the forward scan [32], this is due to the fact that on the forward wave, the product is electrochemically produced and diffusion occurs, giving, as a result, a concentration of zero product within the bulk solution compared to that at the electrode surface. Consequently, on the return scan, returning the electrochemically formed product back to its starting material, a decrease in the concentration of the product has occurred, resulting in a less intense backward peak than the forward one. The Randles-Ševćik equations are only an approximation, and therefore do not represent an exact value, unlike, as for example, the case of chronocoulometry. (3) The Randles-Ševćik equations are more suitable for macroelectrodes, therefore, which size of electrode can be utilized to satisfy the Randles-Ševćik equation? i.e., how big does the electrode need to be in order to give rise to the mass transport dominated by planar diffusion? Compton has undertaken experiments inferring that working electrodes of no less than 4 mm radius should be employed for investigations in aqueous solutions [33]. Their work demonstrates that for a simple electron transfer process, the ∆Ep is reduced from 60.6 mV using a radius of 0.5 mm to 57.5 mV in the case of a radius of 4 mm and larger; the quantitative change is due to the geometric electrode size increasing such radial diffusion [33]. (4) One must consider, is the electrode relatively flat and non-porous? In order for Equations ( 1)- (3) to hold, this should be the case. In the case of a SPE, the electrode is heterogeneous, comprising a range of different carbons (graphite, carbon black) and binder(s). It should be noted that the surface roughness of a SPE is typically 0.078 µm (see Figure S1). Over the timescale of the voltammetric experiment, as determined by Compton [32,34], the diffusion layer is larger than the SPE micro-features such that the electrode kinetics are heterogeneous and dominated by the faster electrode material, i.e., the edge plane features of the graphite(s)/carbon black(s). In this case, Equations ( 1)-( 3) hold; see references [32,34] for the categorisation of electrochemically heterogeneous surfaces that may be encountered. ( 5) The potential window is not reversed too early, and the analysis of the forward peak is used on the first scan [32]. ( 6) The scan rate is not too fast to make the cyclic voltammetric response become non-reversible. This is since the Randles-Ševćik equations are derived from assuming the concentration of the electroactive species in the bulk is the same as that at the surface of the electrode, which, as highlighted above, is due to a diffusion layer developing [32]. (7) In the case of determining the electrode area, a reliable diffusion coefficient (D) value needs to be utilized.

A useful approach is the Wilke-Chang [35] equation to determine the diffusion coefficient:</p>
        <p>where x is the association parameter to define the effective molecular weight of the solvent with respect to the diffusion process (where x = 2.6 for water and x = 1 for non-associated solvents [35]), Ms is the molecular weight of the solvent (g mol -1 ), η is the viscosity of the solution (g cm -1 s -1 ), and V is the molar volume of solute at normal boiling point (cm 3 g -1 mol -1 ). This equation predicts the D value with an exponential error of ±13%. As highlighted by Sitaraman et al. [36], finding the association parameter (x) becomes an issue for unknown systems, therefore the following correction has been proposed:where x is the association parameter to define the effective molecular weight of the solvent with respect to the diffusion process (where x = 2.6 for water and x = 1 for non-associated solvents [35]), Ms is the molecular weight of the solvent (g mol -1 ), η is the viscosity of the solution (g cm -1 s -1 ), and V is the molar volume of solute at normal boiling point (cm 3 g -1 mol -1 ).

Clearly, temperature is critical in determining the electrochemical area. Changes and fluctuations in temperature will affect the information obtained from Equations ( 1)-( 5). Consequently, the temperature at the time of measuring the electrochemical area should be measured and factored into these equations. (8) The Randles-Ševćik equations are useful for single electron transfer processes that feature a 1:1 reaction stoichiometry, inversely however, for example, the reduction of protons to hydrogen (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) has a 2:1 stoichiometry and experimental results deviate from theory [37].

        <p>Electroactive Probe Electrode Area Randles-Ševćik/cm 2 D/cm It is readily evident that a range of %Real values are obtained, alternating from 75 to 123%. Using SPEs, one can realise that this value will likely deviate from 100% due to the binder holding the graphite and carbon black components together comprising the electrode surface. So what value of %Real is the one to be utilised?
