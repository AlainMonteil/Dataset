        <p>Microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology has the potential to become a major renewable energy resource by degrading organic pollutants in wastewater. The performance of MFC directly depends on the kinetics of the electrode reactions within the fuel cell, with the performance of the electrodes heavily influenced by the materials they are made from. A wide range of materials have been tested to improve the performance of MFCs. In the past decade, carbon-based nanomaterials have emerged as promising materials for both anode and cathode construction. Composite materials have also shown to have the potential to become materials of choice for electrode manufacture. Various transition metal oxides have been investigated as alternatives to conventional expensive metals like platinum for oxygen reduction reaction.

        <p>Due to a growing global population, domestic and industrial energy demands are on the rise. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), power demand is expected to rise up to 18 billion tonne oil equivalent by 2035 from a current demand of 12 billion tonne oil equivalent [1]. Presently, most of the world's energy is derived from fossil fuels, but their efficiency, security and environmental effects hold it back from being a preferred energy resource. To meet future energy demands, there is need of a reliable, sustainable and clean energy source. While nuclear power may be an alternative means of energy, with the recent incident in Japan in 2011, the safe and reliable implementation of it remains in question [2].Due to a growing global population, domestic and industrial energy demands are on the rise.

        <p>In the coming decades, access to clean water will be limited in many parts of the world. Recycling of wastewater (wastewater treatment) is one of the ways in which the demand for clean drinking water can be met. At present, most existing wastewater purification technologies consume a lot of energy. According to recent reports, in the United States, water and wastewater systems consume around 5 % of the total energy produced in the country, which happens to be a huge burden on the energy sector [3]. To address this inefficiency, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can be explored to treat wastewater in a more economical and sustainable way.In the coming decades, access to clean water will be limited in many parts of the world.

        <p>An idea developed by British botanist Potter [4] in 1911 was to produce electricity using microbes that oxidize organic molecules. Since then, MFCs have attracted special attention from researchers, representing a promising solution for energy generation. MFCs treat water in addition to generating energy by consuming organic pollutants from the wastewater. Over the last 10 years, this idea has seen a tremendous interest from scientific community leading to a promising power source to provide power for electronic devices [5] and other practical application in a cost-effective manner [6].An idea developed by British botanist Potter [4] in 1911 was to produce electricity using microbes that oxidize organic molecules.

        <p>A fuel cell converts the chemical energy of a fuel into electrical energy without the need for combustion. MFCs are a type of electrochemical fuel cell in which the organic matter found in wastewater is oxidized by microorganisms. Conventionally, MFCs consist of an anode and a cathode separated by proton exchange membrane (PEM) such as Nafion and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE).

        <p>The output power of a MFC depends on various factors including the type of organic matter present in the wastewater, electron transfer rate from bacteria to the anode and the efficiency of the membrane to transfer hydrogen ions [12]. Some microorganisms are known to deliver electrons from their oxidative metabolic pathways to their external environment, such microorganisms are called exoelectrogens [13]. Two major genera of bacteria are known for this ability; Geobacter and Shewanella.

        <p>Direct electron transfer: This type of mechanism is found in the Shewanella, Geobacter species in which electrons are directly transferred to the electrode surface. The outer membrane cytochrome (C-type) is involved in the direct transfer of electrons produced from NADH [14]. Electron transfer through mediators: Few genera of bacteria such as Shewanella and Pseudomonas secrete some chemical species such as flavins called shuttle molecules to transfer electrons from the outer membrane of bacteria to electrodes [15,16].Direct electron transfer: This type of mechanism is found in the Shewanella, Geobacter species in which electrons are directly transferred to the electrode surface.

These conductive networks are cellular outgrowth, as long as 20 lm, termed as nanowires. It is reported that the electronic conductivity of these nanowires is much higher than synthetic metallic nanostructure [19]. Schaetzle et al. suggested fourth mechanism of electron transport by oxidizing the excreted catabolites by the bacteria [20].Electron transfer through nanowires: Geobacter genera and very recently Shewanella are reported to use conductive appendages for electron transfer outside the cell [17,18].

        <p>The selection of the proper electrode material is crucial for the performance of MFCs in terms of bacterial adhesion, electron transfer and electrochemical efficiency. There are many studies to scale up the power production using different carbon-based materials such as carbon paper, carbon felt, carbon fiber as well as carbon nanotube-based composites. To implement the MFC technology in practice, the cost of materials must be reduced and power densities must be maximized. In addition, the cathode materials should have catalytic properties for oxygen reduction [23].The selection of the proper electrode material is crucial for the performance of MFCs in terms of bacterial adhesion, electron transfer and electrochemical efficiency.

        <p>Although the criteria to select materials for the anode and cathode are different, in general both should possess the following properties:Although the criteria to select materials for the anode and cathode are different, in general both should possess the following properties:</p>
        <p>Surface area and porosity: The output power of MFCs is greatly constrained by the surface area of electrodes. The ohmic losses are directly proportional to the resistance of the electrode. The easiest way to decrease the resistance is to increase the effective surface area while keeping the volume the same, hence enhancing the efficiency of the MFC. Furthermore, a high surface area provides more sites for reactions, enhancing electrode kinetics [24] [25]. However, porosity will decrease the electrical conductivity of the material. Electrical conductivity: Electrons released from microbes have to travel along an external circuit after passing through the anode. The high electrical conductivity of the electrode material makes the electron flow with less resistance. At the same time, the interfacial impedance should be low to facilitate the electron transfer. At the cathode, the ionic conductivity is also required to facilitate triple phase boundary reaction [26]. Stability and durability: The reducing and oxidizing environment in an MFC may lead to the swelling and decomposition of the materials. The high surface roughness increases the durability of the material while it might increase the chances of fouling, thus may decrease the long-term performance of the MFC. Therefore, the material for electrodes should be durable as well as stable in an acidic and a basic environment. Cost and accessibility: The cost of the electrode material influences the capital cost of the MFC to a large extent. To commercialize the MFC, the material should be low cost, sustainable and easily available. Some metals like platinum are highly expensive, non-durable and nonsustainable as well. Non-precious metal materials such as composites might be an alternative to substitute precious metals in electrodes in the future.Surface area and porosity: The output power of MFCs is greatly constrained by the surface area of electrodes.

        <p>Liu et al. used eight graphite anodes with a single cathode in a single-chambered MFC and observed a decrease of chemical oxygen demand by 80 % from the initial value. Although, the maximum power obtained was less ca. 26 mW/m 2 . The low porosity of carbon rods limits its wide application in MFCs [12]. Lovley and coworkers solved this problem using similar materials with higher surface areas such as graphite felt electrodes and showed that the maximum current produced was increased by three times because of an increase in electrode surface area [30]. One other approach adopted by Logan et al. involved using a graphite fiber brush electrode wound around a titanium wire to increase the surface area and microbial inoculation. The maximum power density was measured to be up to 2400 mW/m 2 , which was around four times higher than that of carbon paper [29,31]. Carbon cloth, another similar material, showed a maximum power density of up to 483 mW/m 2 [32].Liu et al. used eight graphite anodes with a single cathode in a single-chambered MFC and observed a decrease of chemical oxygen demand by 80 % from the initial value.

        <p>Very recently, Erbay et al. reported that microbes grown over CNTs result in excellent charge transfer characteristics due to p-p stacking between the carbon atoms of graphite and the pili (a cellular outgrowth) of microorganisms [39]. CNTs can be grown directly over the stainless steel mesh to keep the ohmic resistance low. It was observed that the spaces between CNTs have the advantage of providing space for microbe inoculation. Furthermore, the minimum amount of amorphous carbon provides excellent charge interaction.

Qiao et al. showed that a CNT-polyaniline composite enhanced the electrocatalytic property and adhesion with the bacterial cell. They assumed that it was because of the protective effect of polyaniline and large increase in surface area. Other reports showed that CNTs deposition over carbon paper increases the power density by six times as compared to a graphite electrode [47].

The result showed high peak current compared to the separation between the peak voltages, indicating that the polypyrrole-CNT composite increases the electrochemical active area [48]. In addition, polypyrrole-CNT showed a high electron transfer, which means that it is likely that PPy polymer might contain some molecular units similar to redox mediators [49].Recently, it was reported that CNTs incorporated with a conductive polymer can lead to a synergistic effect [46].

        <p>Surface treatment: Various surface treatments for anode materials in MFCs have been investigated to enhance the adhesion with microorganisms.

Figure 4 shows the three-phase interface of the cathode; the catalyst layer, electrode base material and oxygen diffusion layer. Most of the materials used as an anode can be used as a cathode however in addition a robust MFC cathode should have the following properties: A low oxygen reduction rate at a neutral pH and low temperature results in a high over potential, which is a major limitation in MFC performance. Since carbon-based materials have poor catalytic activity, an additional catalyst is required to boost the reduction process.In MFC, the oxygen is reduced at the three-phase interface of air (gas), electrolyte (liquid) and electrode (solid) to form water (four electron pathway) or hydrogen peroxide (two electron pathway).

        <p>A catalyst increases the rate of reduction reaction by decreasing the activation energy barrier. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) follows two different pathways: one is the 4-electron pathway which is more favorable than the other 2-electron pathway [57]. The whole mechanism is described elsewhere in [58]. The ORR in two different electron pathways in acidic medium [59] can be expressed as:A catalyst increases the rate of reduction reaction by decreasing the activation energy barrier.

        <p>Oxygen reduction reaction is insufficient if plain carbon or graphite is used as the cathode. Therefore, it is necessary to coat it with a catalyst layer. In almost all cases, platinum is the most successful catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction because of its high surface area and low over potential for ORR [10]. Zhang et al. used a cathode made of a double layer of PDMS/carbon loaded with Pt and showed that a maximum power density of 1610 mW/m 2 can be achieved. Further, hydrophobic materials like PDMS decrease the water diffusion into a single-chambered MFC. Ghasemi et al. reduced the Pt loading by depositing over CNTs, showing that the ORR catalytic activity was improved for CNT-Pt composite. Further, the ORR was not affected considerably by decreasing Pt loading by 20-fold [60,61].Oxygen reduction reaction is insufficient if plain carbon or graphite is used as the cathode.

        <p>Another transition metal catalyst iron phthalocyanine can be used as a catalyst, taking the advantage of the p-p interaction between the metal and carbon of the aromatic ring, leading to rapid electron transfer [62]. Yuan et al. reported the use of amino functionalized multiwalled CNTs supported with iron phthalocyanine for cathodes. The power density was considerably high with CNT cathodes. It was found that the power density achieved was even higher than platinum-carbon cathodes as shown in Fig. 5 [62].

        <p>Transition metal-based oxide catalysts have also emerged as an alternative to platinum in ORR [65]. Manganese dioxide MnO 2 has been used as a shuttling mechanism for oxygen reduction.

        <p>Lead oxide is also used as an alternative catalyst for MFC cathodes. Some very interesting results obtained by Morris et al. show that power densities were increased to four times than that of commercial Pt/C (10 wt%). Furthermore, the cost of PbO 2 electrodes was 8 times less than Pt-carbon electrode [64]. Activated carbon with large surface areas can be synthesized by electrospinning and pyrolysis of polyacrylonitrile precursor.

        <p>The higher cost, non-environmental friendly and complexity in fabrication of conventional catalysts lead to the development of biocathodes where microorganisms themselves act as the catalyst.

        <p>Biocathodes can be categorized into two groups: aerobic and anaerobic biocathodes. In aerobic biocathodes, oxygen is a terminal electron acceptor and hydrogen peroxide is an intermediate. Transition metals such as iron and manganese act as electron mediators between the electrode and oxygen. Fe (III) is reduced to Fe (II) by electrons generated from the biofilm, which is subsequently oxidized by oxygen. In this way, electrons are transferred from the cathode to the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen in this case [72]. In anaerobic type conditions, where oxygen is not present, nitrates and sulfates can be terminal electron acceptors. Figure 7 shows a biocathode in which biofilm catalyze the reduction of chemical active species such as nitrate and oxygen. The cathodic potentials of nitrate, manganese and iron are comparable to oxygen. In addition, an anaerobic biocathode has the advantage by preventing the loss of electrons through oxygen, which may diffuse to the anode through PEM.Biocathodes can be categorized into two groups: aerobic and anaerobic biocathodes.

        <p>Furthermore, microorganisms at the cathode can be used to produce chemicals such as methane, ethanol and formic acid [73] and can also be used as a biosensor to detect biological oxygen demand (BOD) [74] in water. It is observed that a small amount of non-exoelectrogens are advantageous to facilitate the ORR by exoelectrogens [75]. A typical setup of an MFC using microorganisms as catalysts at the cathode with or without the help of manganese and iron mediator is shown in Fig. 8 It is also proved from cyclic voltammetry that biofilm formation is most facilitated by graphite felt followed by carbon paper and stainless steel mesh [76].Furthermore, microorganisms at the cathode can be used to produce chemicals such as methane, ethanol and formic acid [73] and can also be used as a biosensor to detect biological oxygen demand (BOD) [74] in water.

        <p>The higher cost of metal catalyst along with limited global reserve appealed researchers to find an alternative with comparable catalytic activity, less expensive materials for ORR at cathode. Recently, it was reported that metals as catalyst in ORR only promote the formation of active sites and have no role in catalytic function [77]. Chemically modified carbon-based materials including carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphite foam can be used as catalyst for ORR [78,79]. ORR can proceed to four electron pathway using a nitrogen incorporated catalysts [80][81][82]. Nitrogendoped graphene nanosheets have shown high catalytic activity, stability and onset potential than commercially Fig. 7 MFC biocathode where oxygen and nitrate is reduced using direct electron transfer or using mediator.

The system can be used to generate power or to drive biochemical synthesis reactions to synthesis valueadded chemicals available Pt (10 wt%) for ORR [81,83]. In another study, nitrogen-doped CNTs were found to have higher electrocatalytic activity, lower overpotential and long-term stability for ORR than commercially available Pt (20 wt%, E-TEK) [84]. In Fig. 9, the cyclic voltammogram of nitrogendoped graphene nanosheets is compared with other materials. It is clear from the figure that the nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets show the best catalytic activity compared to other materials. The net peak current density approaches to 8.75 mA/cm 2 for NGNSs-900 which is higher than commercial Pt/C (5.12 mA/cm 2 ).The higher cost of metal catalyst along with limited global reserve appealed researchers to find an alternative with comparable catalytic activity, less expensive materials for ORR at cathode.

        <p>It is proposed in many studies that carbon atom around nitrogen acts as active site for ORR. The higher electronegativity of nitrogen atom withdraws electrons from adjacent carbon atom creating positive carbon atom which acts as active site for activation of O 2 molecule in ORR [85].It is proposed in many studies that carbon atom around nitrogen acts as active site for ORR.

        <p>Electrode materials have a great impact on the performance of MFCs. Since cathodes and anodes have different characteristics, the materials and design for them also differ. In general, electrode materials are considered in terms of surface area, electronic conductivity, chemical stability, cost and accessibility. In addition, an anode material should be biocompatible to allow microorganisms to grow. Materials with cell toxicity cannot be used regardless of their other properties. Carbon-based materials are widely used because of their high conductivity, biocompatibility, chemical stability as well as low cost. Furthermore, the surface treatment of the anode leads to a better performance of the MFC. On the other hand, the cathode materials require enhanced catalytic properties due to the poor kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction. Even though platinum is the best catalyst, research is ongoing to find alternative materials due to its high cost, making it unfeasible to implement in commercial applications. Transition metal oxides such as manganese oxide, nitrogen-doped carbon-based materials have emerged as promising materials for ORR with low cost. Due to a lack of sustainable catalytic materials, microorganisms can also be used as catalysts, which is termed as a biocathode. In the future, microorganisms can be manipulated to increase their endogenous mediators for improved electron transfer. Lastly, a better understanding of microorganism interactions with electrode surfaces will be helpful to optimize the performance of the MFCs.Electrode materials have a great impact on the performance of MFCs.
