        <p>Air pollution, global climate change and fossil energy shortage are the major driven forces behind the development of the energy and transportation sectors. In the automobile industry, traditional enginepowered vehicles are gradually replaced by hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) [1]. For the energy storage system in HEVs/EVs, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used for its high voltage, high energy density, and low self-discharge rate.</p>
        <p>Even though LIBs are the best energy storage system so far, they still have some drawbacks, such as degradation [2], low energy density compared with internal combustion engines [3] and high cost [4]. Low energy density limits the driving mileage of HEV/EVs. Degradation further reduces driving mileage and causes range anxiety, and it also increases the operating cost of HEV/EVs if it needs replacement. Approximately 50% of the vehicle cost is from the battery pack. In addition, recycling of LIBs is another challenging issue that has not been solved [5]. Therefore, reducing battery degradation rate and improving the cycle life of LIBs are of great relevance for future clean transportation. There are two research directions in this area. One is technology advancement in battery cells, such as new material [6], material modification [7] and the improvement of manufacture technology. The other is battery management, including but not limited to, online fault diagnosis [8,9], equalization control [10,11] and thermal management. Battery thermal management has been received increasing attention since the temperature is one of the most sensitive factors to battery cycle life. More importantly, high temperature may lead to the risk of battery thermal runaway.</p>
        <p>Studies of battery thermal management have been carried out to control the temperature of LIBs, from basic air cooling systems to compound systems like PCM and heat pipe compound battery thermal management system (BTMS) [12][13][14][15][16]. In addition, novel thermal management methods are reported [17,18]. The main goal of these studies is to control the temperature of LIBs within the safety range for avoiding battery thermal runaway. However, even the temperature of the LIBs has been controlled under the threshold of the thermal runaway, the temperature still has a great impact on battery cycle life. Experimental tests [19] show that the cycle life of the battery cell reduced by 50% if the temperature rises from 25 C to 45 C [19]. Neubauer et al. [20] of National Renewable Energy Laboratory examined the sensitivity of electric vehicle battery pack degradation to battery thermal management. The battery life was estimated when it was cooled by a passive system and a powerful liquid cooling system with three different operation modes (key-on, standby and combined). The results</p>
        <p>show that applying liquid cooling systems can significantly reduce capacity loss and resistance growth rate, and combined key-on and standby system offered best reduction in degradation. Yuksel et al. [21] assessed the influence of thermal management on battery degradation. The battery life was simulated under the conditions of with and without air-cooling system. Applying an air-cooling system doubled life compared with no BTMS.</p>
        <p>However, the existing studies looked mainly at the impacts and sensitivities of various factors on battery life, and thermal management is one of the many factors. Heat generation and heat transfer processes were modelled by using lumped parameter method, which only solved the average temperature of the whole battery pack rather than temperature distributions. Therefore, indexes of temperature non-uniformity and degradation non-uniformity were not obtained. Meanwhile, BTMS investigated in these studies were limited to several specific scenarios, and the influences of BTMS parameters on battery cycle life has not been studied.</p>
        <p>The novelty of this paper is that it quantitatively evaluates the degradation characteristics, including cycle life and its non-uniformity across the module, of the battery module under different cooling configurations. There is limited literature covering this area, however, it is of great significance for BTMS. Since extending battery cycle life is one of the purposes of battery thermal management, the authors think that battery life should must be considered as one of the indexes of BTMS. However, the previous studies mainly take battery maximum temperature, temperature non-uniformity and power consumption as evaluation indexes for BTMS. Hence, this study proposed a battery health-conscious evaluation index for BTMS, which considers both power consumption of BTMS and cycle life of batteries. The simulation results and newly proposed evaluation index can provide new ideas for battery health-conscious thermal management.</p>
        <p>In this study, a one-dimensional electrochemical model is developed for the lithium-ion battery cell in 
            <rs type="software">COMSOL</rs>, a multi-physics modelling software, where the heat generation can be solved accurately. Then, a two-dimensional thermal model is developed in 
            <rs type="software">COMSOL</rs> to simulate the heat transfer processes in the battery pack. The electrochemical and thermal models are coupled together via heat generation and temperature. The model is validated using experimental data from the literature.
        </p>
        <p>The simulation is carried out by using realistic current load and thermal management methods of active air cooling and passive phase change material (PCM) cooling are involved. On this basis, the timevarying temperature field of the module can be obtained. The degradation process of the battery cell is assessed by a battery capacity loss model. The effects of ambient temperatures, inlet velocities of air cooling and PCM phase change temperatures are studied.</p>
        <p>In this study, a one-dimensional electrochemical model developed by Doyle and Newman [22,23] is used to predict heat generation of LIBs. This model is widely published in literature [24][25][26] and will therefore not be repeated here. The governing equations are provided in Table 1 for completeness. A cylindrical type of the graphite-LiFePO4 battery manufactured by A123 system (ANR26650M1A) is chosen in this study. The positive and negative current collectors are neglected in our study. Geometrical and design parameters, kinetic and transport properties, and thermal properties of the battery used for modelling are listed in Table 2.</p>

        <p>For the simplicity of numerical simulation, thermal radiation in the whole model is neglected.</p>
        <p>Besides, because there is no liquid motion existing in paraffin-graphite composite (thus, its viscosity is regarded as 10 5 kg m -1 s -1 ) [31], the momentum equation is not considered for the melted PCM [31,32]. Therefore, the only one governing equation of both battery cell and PCM domains is the energy conservation equation:</p>
        <p>where the subscript i refers to battery cell or PCM; qi is the heat source term. In the domain of battery cells, qi is the total heat generation coming from the 1-D electrochemical model. The average temperature of the battery cell calculated by Eq.( 1) is used for 1-D electrochemical model. In the domain of PCM, the value of qi is 0. Equivalent heat capacity method is employed to take the melting latent heat of PCM into account, with which the apparent heat capacity of the PCM during phase transition is defined as:</p>
        <p>where Ceq is the equivalent heat capacity of the solid-liquid mixture; CL(T) is the latent heat distribution within phase transition interval.</p>
        <p>In the domain of cooling air, fluid flow and heat transfer are governed by the continuity, momentum conservation and energy conservation equations:</p>
        <p>= ( )</p>
        <p>In PCM cooling condition, PCM is cooled by ambient air in the way of natural convection, the governing equation is:</p>
        <p>The battery degradation is reflected in capacity loss and impedance rise. Here, we only consider the capacity loss of LIBs. Wang et al. [33] developed a capacity loss model for ANR26650M1A (the same with the one studied in this paper) by carrying out a serious of experiments. In their model, the relationship between capacity loss and the temperature is formulated with an Arrhenius type equation. (10) where ΔAht+Δt is the ampere-hour processed during time step Δt, which can be calculated as:</p>
        <p>( ) ( )</p>
        <p>At+Δt is considered as a constant in each time step Δt, the value of which is estimated by linear interpolation between the tabulated values in Table 3. In the process of simulation, the temperature profile of each cell in dynamic cycling can be calculated by the thermal model, and current profile is the input parameter of the electrochemical model.</p>
        <p>Based on temperature and current profiles, the accumulated capacity loss of cells can be solved by using the abovementioned capacity degradation model. Fig. 2 shows the simulated results of cell voltage and surface mean temperature, along with experimental results published in Ref. [25]. The boundary conditions used in the simulation are the same with experimental conditions. Natural heat transfer coefficient (hnatural) of the cell surface is set as 10 W m -2 K -1 [25,34]. Fig. 2 shows that experimental data and simulated results match well, indicating the electro-thermal model is able to simulate battery thermal performance at different discharge rate.</p>
        <p>Fig. 3 shows a battery module with 16 cells is selected for this study. In the air cooling BTMS, the cooling air is sent from the left side of the module (inlet) to the right side (outlet) through the gaps between battery cells and an optimized gap size of 7 mm is adopted according to Ref. [35]. In the PCM based BTMS, the gaps are filled with PCM. In general, the mass of the PCM can be estimated by the equation as follows [36]:</p>
        <p>( )</p>
        <p>where Qbatt is the total heat generation of the battery, mpcm, PCT, Tinitial, L is the mass, phase change temperature, initial temperature and latent heat of PCM, respectively. Because the value of Cp,pcm is much lower than L and Tinitial (Tamb) is one of the variables, the first item on the right side of Eq. ( 14)</p>
        <p>is not considered. Then a minimum mpcm of 24.02 g cell -1 (corresponding gap size between cells is about 5 mm) can be obtained according to the battery heat generation and thermo-physical properties of PCM (see below). On this basis, the PCM based BTMS is assumed to have a same gaps size (7 mm) as the air cooling BTMS, which makes it work better.</p>
        <p>A grid independence study is carried out to decide a proper element size. The temperature of a probe point on battery surface and total heat rate at the outlet are used to test the grid independence. [39] with relatively large thermal conductivity is chosen [40,41], which helps to dissipate the heat from the surface of battery cells to the side of the module and achieve an uniform temperature field. Two sides of the module are modelled as natural convection air cooling with a hnatural of 10 W m -2 K -1 [25,34] and the others are symmetry. Then, the effect of PCT to battery thermal states and life is investigated, whilst the other thermo-physical properties of PCM, such as latent heat, specific heat capacity and transition interval, are kept constant. The Tamb is swept from 0 C to 50 C. Table 5 and Table 6 list the boundary conditions of the model and thermo-physical properties of PCM, respectively.</p>
        <p>The results and discussion are divided to three sub-sections, including the results of air cooling and PCM cooling, and the comparison of air cooling and PCM cooling.</p>
        <p>where T ̅ max and T ̅ min are the maximum and minimum space and time-averaged cell temperature among the module, respectively. It can be seen that ΔT increases first and then decreases when Vin increases from 0 m s -1 to 8 m s -1 . The maximum ΔT is observed at Tamb = 50 C and Vin = 0.5 m s -1 .</p>
        <p>Fig. 11 shows the trajectories of capacity loss predicted by the degradation model [33]. The battery life is defined as the number of cycles that lead to a 20% capacity loss.</p>
        <p>We use the mean cycle life (N ̅ ), maximum cycle life difference (ΔN) and maximum cycle life difference rate (ζN) to evaluate the degradation of the module, which are given by the following equations:</p>
        <p>where Ni is the cycle life of each cell in the module, Nmax and Nmin are the maximum and minimum cycle life of the cell in the module. increased Vin, ζN shows a trend of increasing first and decreasing afterwards. The maximum ζN is observed at Vin = 0.5 m s -1 and it is higher than 20%. It should be noted that ζN at a low Tamb is not significantly larger than the other conditions due to prolonged cycle life, though its ΔT is the largest. the PCM with lower PCT can achieve improved cycle life. However, it is more likely to be completely melted in continuous charging/discharging cycle with high rates and at high Tamb conditions, which will put the battery module at the risk of accelerating the degradation process. In consequence, it's a conflict while choosing the type of PCM especially when the battery pack is to be used in a wide Tamb range. Because PCM cooling is a passive BTMS and does not consume energy, we emphasize on the energy consumption analysis of air cooling. Power consumption considered in this study includes the pumping power of the fan and refrigerating power of the air conditioning system. The ideal pumping power consumption is calculated using Eq.( 16):</p>
        <p>where Δp is the pressure drop from the inlet to the outlet of duct; V ̇ is the volume flow rate of cooling air.</p>
        <p>The refrigerating power is evaluated by assuming that the refrigeration cycle of the air conditioning system has a constant Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 2 in all conditions [42]. Thus, the ideal refrigerating power consumption can be calculated by Eq.( 17 where ṁa ir is the mass flow rate; ΔTair is the temperature increase of the cooling air from the inlet to the outlet. Fig. 20 presents the pressure drop and temperature increase between the inlet and the outlet of cooling air. Fig. 21 shows the ideal power consumptions of fan and air conditioning system. A sharp rise of power consumption while increasing Vin can be observed, which is attributed to the dramatically rising fan power. Total power consumption also increases when Tamb rises to 30 C because the airconditioning system is turned on to produce 20 C cooling air.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the cost performance of air cooling and PCM cooling systems, this study take battery cycle life as an additional performance indicator of BTMS on top of battery maximum temperature, temperature non-uniformity and power consumption which are taken as the main performance indicators in most previous studies and an evaluation index of cyclical cost (δ) is proposed to link indicators of power consumption and battery cycle life together. δ is defined as the ratio of the total cost, including purchasing cost of the battery module and parasitic energy cost of BTMS to the module cycle life (capacity loss reaches 20%). δ is expressed as the following equation:</p>
        <p>where τbatt is the battery; C nom PACK is the nominal capacity of the battery module; Neof is the number of cycles of the battery pack before end of life; Qp is the parasitic energy consumption per cycle; τf is the fuel price; Hfuel is the lower heating value of the fuel; ηPT is efficiency of the hybrid powertrain and is assumed to be 30.1% [43]. Table 7 lists the values of Qp, τf and Hfuel obtained from Ref. [44]. Such economic index is also a common practice in the researches of power management for HEV [37,[44][45][46].</p>

        <p>This study analyses the thermal states and cycle life of a battery module under a dynamic current load obtained from a hybrid electric bus (16.55 km in approximately 3000 s) when active air cooling using air-conditioned air and passive PCM cooling are independently applied for thermal management.</p>
        <p>The effects of inlet velocity (Vin), PCM phase change temperature (PCT) and ambient temperature (Tamb) are studied. The following are conclusions drawn from results and discussion.</p>
        <p>1. Active air cooling using air-conditioned air is able to keep the module temperature under safety range even at Tamb as high as 50 C, whereas passive PCM based BTMS in which PCM is cooled by natural convection with air at ambient temperature is difficult to achieve this. However, a more uniform temperature field can be obtained with PCM cooling.</p>
        <p>2. Due to the lower temperature field in air cooling condition, module cycle life is extended by up to 600% compared with that of the PCM cooling. In the air cooling condition, the maximum cycle life difference rate (ζN) is over 20% at a low Vin, e.g. 0.5 m s -1 . With the increase of Vin, ζN is reduced. In PCM cooling condition, ζN is lower than 5% and the largest value is 4.1%, which has a strong link to the liquid phase fraction of PCM.</p>
        <p>3. The cyclical cost (δ) of the battery module using air-conditioned air cooling is much lower than that using PCM cooling. In PCM cooling, δ can be double due to limited module cycle life. For the air cooling, the δ first decreases and then increases while increasing Vin. There exists an optimal Vin for the lowest δ at different Tamb.</p>
        <p>4. To extend the life and reduce operating cost of LIBs by means of thermal management, active air cooling is the better choice than passive PCM only cooling. For the purpose of both extending the life and improving the uniformity of the LIB pack, PCM and active compound system may be the best choice.</p>
        <p>The generic capacity degradation model given by Wang et al. is expressed as follows:</p>
        <p>In addition, during the capacity loss assessment, we also have following simplifications:</p>
        <p>(1)</p>
        <p>The ageing mechanisms are the same during charge and discharge; (2) The capacity loss during storage (calendar life) is neglected.</p>
