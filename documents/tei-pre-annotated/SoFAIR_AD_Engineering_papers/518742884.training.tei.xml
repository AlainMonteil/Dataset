        <p>Research and development of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells has seen a marked increase since the recent expiry of core patents describing SHJ technology. SHJ solar cells are expected to offer various cost benefits compared to conventional crystalline silicon solar cells. This paper analyses the production costs associated with five different SHJ cell designs, including an interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) design. Using life-cycle costing, we analyzed the current cost breakdown of these SHJ designs, and compared them to conventional diffused junction monocrystalline silicon modules. Coupling the results for current designs with literature data on technological improvements, we also present a prospective analysis of production costs for the five SHJ cells and modules.Research and development of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells has seen a marked increase since the recent expiry of core patents describing SHJ technology.

        <p>For current designs, module costs were calculated to be 0.48-0.56 USD per Watt-peak (W p ) for SHJ modules, compared to 0.50 USD/W p for a conventional c-Si module. The efficiency bonus for SHJ modules compared to conventional c-Si modules is offset by a strong increase in metallization costs for SHJ designs, as comparatively large amounts of low-temperature silver-paste are required. For module materials, the requirement for conductive adhesives results in a small cost penalty for SHJ modules compared to c-Si modules, which is more than balanced by the effect of higher efficiency in SHJ modules.For current designs, module costs were calculated to be 0.48-0.56 USD per Watt-peak (W p ) for SHJ modules, compared to 0.50 USD/W p for a conventional c-Si module.

        <p>Our prospective study showed that improvements in cell processing and module design could result in a significant drop in production costs for all module types studied. The SHJ modules gain much advantage by reducing and replacing silver consumption, increased cell efficiency and thinner wafers and have prospective production costs of 0.29-0.35 USD=W p . Conventional c-Si module cost is less sensitive to silver paste consumption, limiting the potential for cost reduction, and has prospective production costs of 0.33 USD=W p . Replacement of indium-tin-oxide was not found to contribute substantially to a reduction in module costs.Our prospective study showed that improvements in cell processing and module design could result in a significant drop in production costs for all module types studied.

        <p>Concurrently with the strong growth in PV module production and sales, average PV module prices have dropped sharply over the last decade. Polysilicon, wafer, cell and module prices dropped especially sharp over the last few years, as shown in Fig. 1. In the Netherlands, PV module prices including tax dropped by almost 50% between 2011 and 2013, from 2 EUR per W p to 1.13 EUR per W p [1], while global spot prices (excluding tax) for PV modules have dropped to 0.6 USD=W p (see Fig. 1). Price decreases have long been following a learning curve that has been valid for multiple decades, however, more recently, due to decreased demand and resulting oversupply, prices have dropped below what could be extrapolated from the learning curve. As a result, PV producers are scrambling for opportunities to reduce production costs. On the other hand, although residential grid parity has been reached in several countries worldwide [2], PV electricity is as of yet not competitive with fossil electricity generation [3][4][5][6][7]. These two factors emphasize the need for further cost reductions in the PV industry, in order to assure PV production that is financially sustainable and competitive with bulk electricity generation.Concurrently with the strong growth in PV module production and sales, average PV module prices have dropped sharply over the last decade.

        <p>Photovoltaic systems offer us the possibility to produce electricity with low emissions of greenhouse gasses [9][10][11][12][13], low energy pay-back time, and low emissions of toxic or otherwise harmful substances, compared to traditional forms of electricity production. Its' modular nature allows for the application on a variety of scales, from small-scale decentralized and off-grid to large-scale, centralized electricity production. According to International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook, PV will contribute significantly to a sustainable energy supply system [14]. Because of this expectation, adoption of PV is being supported by national governments worldwide, at sometimes high financial costs for society [15]. Cost reductions are thus of substantial societal importance when deployment of solar energy covers larger shares of total electricity generation.Photovoltaic systems offer us the possibility to produce electricity with low emissions of greenhouse gasses [9][10][11][12][13], low energy pay-back time, and low emissions of toxic or otherwise harmful substances, compared to traditional forms of electricity production.

        <p>In order for PV to become a competitive source of electricity production, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from PV should decrease below residential electricity prices ("socket parity") and below wholesale electricity prices ("grid parity"). Furthermore, for PV to become a viable investment option for both consumers and businesses, the payback time (PBT) of investing in PV should drop to about 3-5 years [16]. Fig. 2 shows the effect of PV system price and annual yield on LCOE and PBT. From this figure, we can deduce that, in order for PV to reach grid parity (instead of the already achieved socket parity) PV system prices still need to drop significantly. For PV to compete with combined-cycle natural gas and coal with a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of about 0.05 USD/ kWh [17], we estimate that PV system prices need to drop below 0.60-1.00 USD/W p , thus PV module prices should drop below 0.3-0.5 USD W p 1 For a large part, cost reductions in PV production have been achieved due to economies of scale, and technological learning in the PV production supply chain [18]. More recently we have seen an increased focus on intrinsic cost reductions. General approaches for cost reductions have traditionally been to decrease material use or replace expensive materials with cheaper ones. For instance, silicon consumption per watt-peak (W p ) has decreased significantly due to increased efficiencies and the use of increasingly thin wafers, while silver use for metallization has also decreased over the years. Significant cost reductions have been obtained with this approach, however, more recently the room for further improvement has decreased. This has resulted in a variety of approaches being researched, including a shift from the traditional diffused junction crystalline PV devices, towards alternative designs or technologies.In order for PV to become a competitive source of electricity production, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from PV should decrease below residential electricity prices ("socket parity") and below wholesale electricity prices ("grid parity").

        <p>One of those "new" technologies is the silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technology. SHJ solar cells are produced from silicon wafers in a low temperature process that does not exceed 200 °C. High temperature diffusion of the p-n junction is replaced with a low temperature deposition of a p-doped amorphous silicon layer on an n-type monocrystalline silicon wafer.One of those "new" technologies is the silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technology.

        <p>This technology is only produced on a large scale by Panasonic (by acquiring Sanyo), but a recent expiry of the core patents describing their SHJ technology has lead to a marked increase in R&amp;D on this technology [19,20]. The large interest is mainly due to the fact that [19,20]: (1) SHJ fabrication is a simple process with high efficiency cells as a result; (2) the deposition of the thin film layers for SHJ cells can benefit from ample experience with these processes in the flat-display industry; (3) SHJ modules have a low temperature coefficient which leads to higher energy yields compared to conventional c-Si modules, and (4) SHJ cells benefit more from the application of thinner wafers, because the deposited thin-film layers allow for very good passivation of the wafer surface.This technology is only produced on a large scale by Panasonic (by acquiring Sanyo), but a recent expiry of the core patents describing their SHJ technology has lead to a marked increase in R&amp;D on this technology [19,20].

        <p>In this paper we present an analysis of the cost structure of PV modules based on five different SHJ cell designs, and, as a reference, conventional diffused junction monocrystalline silicon PV cells. Furthermore, we use the results obtained to evaluate a roadmap towards significant cost reductions in prospective SHJ modules. With the analysis of current production costs, we aim to establish a baseline, but also to compare and rank different SHJ cell designs in terms of cost, and to provide an upfront cost estimation of these different cell designs while they are still under development. Together with previous work [13] focusing on the environmental performance of SHJ solar cells and modules, we aim to perform an ex-ante technological assessment of SHJ technology, and SHJ cell and module production on an industrial scale of designs currently in laboratory stage. To analyze where this technology could go in 10 years, we have also investigated a roadmap towards production of derivatives of the SHJ designs in 2025.In this paper we present an analysis of the cost structure of PV modules based on five different SHJ cell designs, and, as a reference, conventional diffused junction monocrystalline silicon PV cells.

        <p>In a previous study we performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) of four of the five SHJ designs studied here, resulting in a detailed description of SHJ cell and module production [13]. LCA studies aim to establish the environmental impact of products, and are based on establishing a life cycle inventory (LCI): a detailed inventory of all material and energy inputs and waste outputs of production of a product. We used the life cycle inventory gathered in our previous study to perform a bottom-up cost analysis using life cycle costing (LCC), by attributing costs to all the material, energy and waste flows in the LCI. Some updates were made to our previous LCI. The LCI used in this study is shown, per processing step, in Tables A2-A7 in the appendix.In a previous study we performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) of four of the five SHJ designs studied here, resulting in a detailed description of SHJ cell and module production [13].

        <p>This study presents productions cost for five different SHJ cell designs. For most of these designs, it is difficult to assign an accurate cell efficiency, as they are not being produced and tested at a large scale. With an approach similar to that in [18] we have calculated cell efficiencies for each of the SHJ designs, based on an assumed cell efficiency of 22.4% for the reference SHJ design, adjusting the efficiency for each alternative design based on the effect of changes in the cell structure on open-circuit voltage (V oc ), short-circuit current (I sc ) and fill factor (FF). The assumed efficiencies for each of the SHJ designs, and the assumptions made for their calculations are shown in Table 3.This study presents productions cost for five different SHJ cell designs.

        <p>The production costs for the designs studied were calculated by combining material and energy prices with a life cycle inventory (LCI) of cell production. The LCI gives a detailed bill of materials needed for production of the studied solar cells and modules.

        <p>The LCI data from our previous study [13], was gathered with the aim of analysing the environmental impact of solar cell production. Therefore, it is focused on material and energy in-an outputs, and emissions of harmful substances. As a result, it does not accurately reflect costs at all times. For instance, the price of silver and indium on the global market is not only a result of the materials and energy expended in acquiring them, but is also a reflection of the balance between the supply and demand of these materials. Also, as labor has no direct environmental impact (or one that is negligible), it is also not included in an environmental LCI, at least not on the basis of man-hours.The LCI data from our previous study [13], was gathered with the aim of analysing the environmental impact of solar cell production.

        <p>To account for this difference, we have supplemented the data with processes like labor, and have attributed cost at the highest level in de LCI. For instance, instead of calculating the cost of input energy and materials using life cycle costing (LCC), we have instead used the market price of these inputs. In this sense, our study deviates from a true LCC.

We generated 100,000 random samples of these parameters from log-normal distributions with means of the base values, and sigmas reflecting the uncertainty in each parameter. After that, the results were recalculated for each of the generated samples. The resulting data was presented as boxplots showing the variation in the overall result that was obtained. We opted to use log-normal (instead of normal) distributions as we assumed the parameters under investigation, such as module efficiency and prices, to be more constrained on one side of the mean, and to have a longer tail on the other side, e.g. the uncertainty was assumed to not be symmetrically distributed around the mean. The variance of the lognormal distribution was chosen so the 95th percentile of the distribution reflects the upper level of the uncertainty we want to investigate.Ag pads print rear Fig. 7.

        <p>The starting point for all of the devices analyzed in this study is a monocrystalline silicon wafer. Wafer production is generally an activity for dedicated wafer production companies, although supply-demand imbalances in the wafer production chain have resulted in an increased number of PV companies vertically integrating polysilicon, ingot and wafering in their activities [18]. Aside from more vertically integrated firms, the polysilicon production capacity has been expanded significantly since the price of polysilicon peaked in 2011. This has resulted in polysilicon prices dropping sharply, from around 80 USD/kg in 2011 to around 20 USD/kg from the end of 2012 until now (see Fig. 1).The starting point for all of the devices analyzed in this study is a monocrystalline silicon wafer.

        <p>In terms of costs, this process main costs are consumables (the etchant solutions), capital expenditures (CapEx) and waste treatment. A survey on wet chemical treatment tools [27] shows average CapEx to be 293 7 52 USD/(wafer/h), resulting in a wafer processing cost of 0.017 USD/wafer for capital investments, while total cost-of-ownership (CoO) including consumables is 0.075 USD per wafer.

        <p>After wet chemical treatment, the electronic structure of the SHJ cell is applied by deposition of thin a-Si:H layers on both sides of the wafers. On one side, an a-Si:H (i) layer is deposited, followed by a p-type a-Si:H layer. On the other side, an i/n þ a-Si:H stack is deposited. Main consumables are electricity, silane, hydrogen, and water. Because of the very thin layers applied (5 nm for the intrinsic layers, up to 20 nm for the doped layers) the material consumption is very low. As a result, most of the cost of this process step results from the capital expenditures for the processing tools. CapEx for PECVD was based on equipment costs for PECVD tools used for a-Si:H deposition in the preparation of thin film modules. A survey [30] showed large variation in the cost of these tools (ranging from 1489 to 5393 kUSD/(wafer/h), especially the older tools were found to have very high costs. PECVD tools for deposition of SiN x ARC layers were found to have much lower costs, on average 882 USD/(wafer/h) [31], but as this process occurs at higher pressures, we assume these tools to be cheaper compared to those for a-Si:H deposition. We have selected the two most recent tools from the survey [30] to calculate PECVD costs for a-Si:H deposition, and found these to be 1676 USD/(wafer/h). Resulting processing costs were found to be 0.050 USD/wafer for capital expenses, or 0.078 USD/wafer including consumables and utilities.After wet chemical treatment, the electronic structure of the SHJ cell is applied by deposition of thin a-Si:H layers on both sides of the wafers.

        <p>PECVD is followed by the deposition of a TCO layer, in this case ITO, on both sides of the wafer. This transparent conductive oxidelayer is applied to improve lateral conduction in the device, while maintaining a high absorbance of light in the p/n region of the device. This deposition of ITO is commonly assumed to be expensive, as indium is a scarce and quite expensive material (750 USD/kg). According to our cost model however, this processing step is not as expensive as expected. The very thin layers deposited do not require much material (0.028 gram/wafer), and utilization factors in the sputtering tools are quite high (88%, resulting in ITO consumption of 0.032 gram per wafer). The cost of ITO target material was calculated to be about 0.85 USD/gram, although this is a rough estimation, and likely an overestimation, as we assume that commercial targets to approach raw materials prices (0.75 USD/gram). Capital costs for the sputtering tools we reviewed were found to be on average 1573 USD/(wafer/h) [28]. The total CoO of TCO deposition was found to be 0.087 USD/wafer, of which 0.027 USD/wafer (31%) was due to the consumption of ITO.PECVD is followed by the deposition of a TCO layer, in this case ITO, on both sides of the wafer.

        <p>A main cost factor in cell processing, as expected, was found to be the silver based metallization. As SHJ solar cells have to be processed at low temperatures (below 250 °C), there is a need for low-temperature silver paste. This paste is more expensive than conventional metallization paste, and more of it is needed to reach the required contact resistance values in the cells. We assume that the higher price of low temperature paste is mainly the result of a higher silver content in these pastes, but supply and demand dynamics possibly also play a role, as the market for lowtemperature paste is much smaller to that of regular (hightemperature) paste.A main cost factor in cell processing, as expected, was found to be the silver based metallization.

        <p>Current silver paste cost were conservatively estimated at 820 USD/kg for high-temperature and 1060 USD/kg for lowtemperature paste. Because of the lower conductivity of the cured low-temperature paste, we assume that double the amount of silver is required compared to high-temperature silver paste metallization. A metallization grid is therefore assumed to require 200 mg silver per side of the wafer, or 250 mg of paste, assuming 80% loading of the paste with silver. For the reference SHJ design, we assume that the application of a silver grid on both sides of the solar cell, thus the total paste requirement per cell is 0.5 grams. Total materials costs for metallization amount to 0.55 USD/wafer, or 0.10 USD/W p . In current and past SHJ cell R&amp;D many different metallization layouts have been studied for the backside of the cell, including silver screen printed grids, aluminium PVD back contact and silver PVD back contact.

        <p>The replacement of the ITO layer on the front results in an increased requirement for PECVD. This does however not result in a strong decrease of throughput of the PECVD step as the p-layer is replaced by the combined layer and the main time-consuming factors are a result of creating and releasing the vacuum in the processing chambers, which is done once less. For the deposition of a total of 130 nm layer thickness, which is an increase in terms of total deposited layer thickness by a factor of 2.6, throughput drops with only about 4.5% compared to the reference design, based on throughput figures for a the selected PECVD tools mentioned in Section 3.2.2. This results in an increase of processing cost for PECVD by 0.025 USD/wafer to a total of 0.10 USD/wafer. The absence of the ITO deposition on the front however gives an advantage of 0.03 USD/wafer, largely due to increased throughput and an ITO consumption cost reduction of 0.013 USD/wafer.The replacement of the ITO layer on the front results in an increased requirement for PECVD.

        <p>The relative cost of the PECVD deposition of the back-side i/n a-Si:H stack (25 nm total thickness) is quite high, as the throughput of the PECVD tool only increases by about 20% on average, while the capital related cost of processing only decreases by 11% compared to deposition of 50 nm of total a-Si:H layer thickness.

        <p>The IBC-SHJ cell undergoes the same wet chemical treatment as the other designs, however, after this step the differences are pronounced. First with PECVD, on the front side of the cell a passivation layer (intrinsic a-Si:H) and SiN x antireflective coating (ARC) are applied, while on the backside an a-Si:H emitter is applied. Then, a base mask is applied, followed by the mask for local plasma etching of the emitter and deposition of the a-Si:H backsurface-field (BSF). The BSF mask is removed and replaced with a second mask for TCO deposition and deposition of the evaporated silver back-contact. We have assumed that contact coverage at the rear side to be 80%, with a thickness of 0.4 micron, thus requiring 140 mg of silver target per wafer, assuming a 74% utilization rate in the sputtering tool.The IBC-SHJ cell undergoes the same wet chemical treatment as the other designs, however, after this step the differences are pronounced.

        <p>The increased requirement of PECVD, coupled with the application and removal of masks, requires a three-step PECVD. This leads to a decreased throughput, and as a result, a strong increase in capital costs. Furthermore, material requirements are much higher, and yield losses increase due to the number of handling steps when applying and removing the masks. The total cost of processing of PECVD therefore increases more than three-fold compared to the reference design, to 0.27 USD/wafer, of which 0.03 USD/wafer due to yield losses (compared to only 0.0011 USD/ wafer for the reference SHJ design).The increased requirement of PECVD, coupled with the application and removal of masks, requires a three-step PECVD.

        <p>Logically, wafer prices are mainly influenced by two parameters: silicon usage per wafer, and silicon price per kg. Apart from a peak in the silicon price in 2008, silicon prices are relatively stable between 15 and 30 USD/kg (see Fig. 5). Cost reductions for silicon wafers therefore mainly focus on reducing wafer thickness and sawing losses. Goodrich et al. [18] project wafer prices to decrease significantly, due to these two cost reduction strategies, but also include the change from standard to diamond-wire saws, as this should increase throughput [35,48]. Diamond wire saws furthermore are more durable and do not require silicon-carbide slurry but work with a much cheaper cutting fluid based on water and surfactant [18].Logically, wafer prices are mainly influenced by two parameters: silicon usage per wafer, and silicon price per kg.

        <p>Cost reductions in solar cell metallization focus on two aspects: (1) reduction of material consumption and (2) substitution of high-cost metallization materials. Because of the high cost of silver-based metallization, the amount of silver used per cell has decreased, and is expected to continue decreasing for the coming years [35]. Although silver use per cell is constrained by minimum conductivity requirements [49], it is expected to decrease from 100 mg per cell in 2015 to about 40 mg/cell in 2025 [48]. This material use reduction alone results in significant cost reductions if application to all designs would be possible. For the conventional mono-crystalline cell, reduction from 100 to 40 mg/cell of silver would drop metallization costs by 36%, or 0.02 USD/W p . A reduction to 40 mg/cell of silver would actually mean that the Alback paste would contribute the majority of metallization costs. However, as the Al paste is essential for the Al-BSF in the Ref-cSi design, the backside metallization of this design remains the same.Cost reductions in solar cell metallization focus on two aspects: (1) reduction of material consumption and (2) substitution of high-cost metallization materials.

        <p>Further cost reductions can be obtained by replacing silver with copper. Copper has similar conductivity at only a fraction of the cost of silver. Currently, the cost of copper is less than 2% of the cost of silver. However, copper oxidizes much more easily compared to silver, and diffusion of copper into the silicon substrate is also an issue, as copper atoms diffusing into the silicon can negatively affect performance [50], through a variety of mechanisms [51]. Copper diffusion can be prevented by a nickel barrier layer, while oxidation is prohibited by covering the copper with a thin layer of silver applied with electroplating. Another approach to reduce copper oxidation is to dry/cure the applied metal contact lines in an inert (nitrogen) atmosphere [52]. Printed copper busbars that were printed on top of a SiN x ARC and cured at low temperature in a o 10 ppm oxygen atmosphere were shown to result in high module efficiencies, while subsequent thermal cycling and damp heat test showed no copper diffusion into the silicon [50]. Other recent results have furthermore demonstrated a newly developed copper paste that offers similarly low contact resistance compared to silver-based pastes, and can be cured at low temperature in "normal" atmosphere after screen printing [53]. However, line resistances were found to be much higher compared to both low temperature silver paste and high temperature silver paste [53].Further cost reductions can be obtained by replacing silver with copper.

        <p>In the area of copper metallization, copper electroplating is often mentioned as the prime candidate, as it has been shown to offer the possibility of high-efficiency, silver-free heterojunction solar cells, at a large cost-advantage compared to silver screen printed SHJ cells [54,55]. However, electroplated contacts require a multi-step process, consisting of screen-printing and curing a plating resist ink [18], plating different metal layers, and stripping the resist ink in a wet chemical tool. Despite this added complexity, the cost of plating is indeed significantly decreased compared to silver screen-printed contacts [55].In the area of copper metallization, copper electroplating is often mentioned as the prime candidate, as it has been shown to offer the possibility of high-efficiency, silver-free heterojunction solar cells, at a large cost-advantage compared to silver screen printed SHJ cells [54,55].

        <p>Although adoption of copper metallization in mass production of PV is not expected before 2018 [35], we have modelled our prospective designs with copper plated contacts, as we feel silver substitution is not only advisable for cost reductions, but also necessary, as silver is becoming an increasingly scarce material [56,57,49,58], so an upwards trend of the silver price is likely. The copper plated metallization assume a metal stack of nickel, as a seed layer and copper diffusion barrier, copper, as the main contact metal, and silver, as a capping layer which prevents oxidation of the copper. Electrolyte costs were modelled based on their composition, with the cost of plating equipment was taken from [55].Although adoption of copper metallization in mass production of PV is not expected before 2018 [35], we have modelled our prospective designs with copper plated contacts, as we feel silver substitution is not only advisable for cost reductions, but also necessary, as silver is becoming an increasingly scarce material [56,57,49,58], so an upwards trend of the silver price is likely.

        <p>Especially for SHJ solar cells, Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) is a commonly used TCO material. Because of the high cost and perceived scarcity of Indium, replacement of ITO with other materials is under investigation in many R&amp;D projects. Zinc oxide, doped with boron or aluminium is a commonly named alternative [18]. Our results show that the deposition of ITO layers does not contribute much to the overall costs of cell and module production, as the amount of material used is very low. Still, we assume our prospective designs to be ITO-free, as there are concerns about the availability of indium [59,60] and ZnO targets were calculated to be slightly cheaper. Due to the higher resistance of ZnO compared to ITO, this replacement does however result in an efficiency penalty, due to an increased series resistance (R s ). Also, the workfunction of ZnO is sub-optimal for contacting a p-type a-Si:H layer. Aside from materials, TCO sputtering seems to be a mature process, with relatively low capital costs and high throughput.Especially for SHJ solar cells, Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) is a commonly used TCO material.

        <p>Cell production costs (in USD=W p ) are shown in Fig. 8. As expected, a main contributor to cell production costs is the wafer, for all designs. The SHJ designs have cell production costs ranging from 0.31 to 0.35 USD=W p , while the cell production cost for the c-Si cell was found to be 0.31 USD=W p . The IBC design benefits strongly from its high efficiency and substitution of silver paste with PVD silver, which offsets the cost penalties for lower yield and throughput, while the bifacial Ref-SHJ cell shows a strong cost-penalty for requiring a large amount of low-temperature silver paste. The novel emitter and ALD SHJ designs are affected by their lower efficiency, and thus have higher production costs compared to the reference design. The PVD-SHJ design has the lowest cost of the SHJ designs, as it benefits from high efficiency and substitution of low-temperature silver paste.Cell production costs (in USD=W p ) are shown in Fig. 8.

        <p>Comparing the Ref-cSi cell with both the Ref-SHJ and PVD-SHJ designs shows that the choice of metallization layout likely determines the competitiveness of SHJ technology.

        <p>When intercomparing the SHJ designs, we see that the replacement of the front ITO in the NE-SHJ design does not result in a cost reduction compared to the Ref-SHJ design, as there is a significant assumed efficiency penalty for this novel SHJ design.

        <p>As indium is a relatively expensive material, the effect of replacing the ITO layer was expected to be larger. However, the LCA model [13] already showed that only very small amounts of indium are required as the layer thickness is very small. For two 80 nm layers of ITO, slightly over 0.03 grams of ITO was calculated to be required per cell (based on typical utilization rates, density of ITO, and the volume of the layer). The increased requirement for PECVD in the novel emitter design slightly decreases the advantage obtained by having no sputtered TCO layer, as the increased a-Si layer thickness leads to a slightly decreased throughput, and thus an increased cost of processing (CoP, see Eq. ( 1)). The main determinant for higher production costs of the NE-SHJ design is however the decreased efficiency compared to the Ref-SHJ design.As indium is a relatively expensive material, the effect of replacing the ITO layer was expected to be larger.

        <p>Fig. 9 shows the costs of complete PV modules based on the designs studied, while Fig. 10 shows the cost of the module materials. The requirement of conductive adhesive results in a small cost penalty for SHJ modules, while the structured back foil required for the IBC-SHJ design results in a larger cost increase for this particular module. These added costs compared to conventional modules are not completely be balanced by the increased module efficiencies. Especially for the NE-SHJ and ALD-SHJ designs, the relative increase in efficiency is to small to offset added costs of cells and module components.

        <p>In Section 4 we identified several developments and pathways towards reduction of PV production costs. To summarize, these were: (1) Increased cell and module efficiency for all designs (2) Decreased cost of wafers due to higher silicon utilization (thin wafers, less kerf loss) (3) Reduction of silver usage per cell followed by (4) Substitution of silver with copper (5) Replacement of ITO with ZnO, and (6) Slight changes to the module frame. Fig. 11 shows the effect of these changes on the five module designs studied here. Major cost reductions can be obtained by improved cell efficiency and lower wafer production costs. The increased efficiency of the prospective SHJ designs leads to a cost decrease of 12-16%, while this figure is 9.6% for the reference c-Si design. Higher silicon utilization due to thinner wafers, produced with less silicon kerf losses, allow for a reduction in cost of 9-10% for the SHJ designs (11% for c-Si). The reduction of silver consumption projected by the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics [48], of about 60% in 2025, would allow for a cost reduction of 11% for the silver-heavy Ref-SHJ designs, and 6% for the remaining SHJ designs with screen printed Ag grids. Substitution of silver with copper-based metallization would allow for a further decrease of 4-7%. Silver use reduction ( À4%) and substitution ( À6%) would not decrease the production costs of the conventional c-Si module as much, as the contribution of metallization cost to overall costs is much lower (see Fig. 8). Replacement of TCO would allow for cost reduction of around 1%, while reduction in the amount of aluminium used for the module frame and a switch to bifacial modules where possible, would allow for a further cost reduction of 3-5% for all designs.In Section 4 we identified several developments and pathways towards reduction of PV production costs.

        <p>The cell and module production costs shown above rely heavily on a few major parameters: (1) Uncertainty in cell and thus module efficiency; (2) Historical variation in wafer cost; (3) Variation in silver paste price and uncertainty in silver consumption per cell, and (4) Uncertainty in prices of consumables. We performed a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, to show the sensitivity of the overall results to changes in these parameters and to assess the effect of uncertainty in these parameters on the overall result. To analyze the sensitivity of the overall results to these parameters, we varied the parameters and plotted the resulting module costs in Fig. 13. For the uncertainty analysis, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation: random samples for each parameter were generated from a log-normal distribution, and the overall module cost was recalculated with these random samples. For instance, we generated 100,000 module efficiencies randomly from a lognormal distribution and recalculated module costs with these 100,000 samples. The resulting ranges of results are represented as box plots in Fig. 14 showing the distribution of obtained module costs.The cell and module production costs shown above rely heavily on a few major parameters: (1) Uncertainty in cell and thus module efficiency; (2) Historical variation in wafer cost; (3) Variation in silver paste price and uncertainty in silver consumption per cell, and (4) Uncertainty in prices of consumables.

        <p>We assigned an efficiency range to each of the studied designs, assuming that the efficiency of the Ref-cSi design has the smallest uncertainty, being the most established cell design. For the SHJ designs, the range in efficiencies analyzed is larger, especially for the conceptual NE-SHJ and ALD-SHJ designs. The ranges studied are shown in Table 10. These ranges were estimated roughly, based on the deviation of the designs' layout and processing cycle from that of the Ref-SHJ design.We assigned an efficiency range to each of the studied designs, assuming that the efficiency of the Ref-cSi design has the smallest uncertainty, being the most established cell design.

        <p>As shown in Fig. 13(a), module cost is quite sensitive to changes in module efficiency. When we varied cell efficiency over the ranges described in Table 10, costs change with a factor of the inverse of the relative efficiency change. The figure clearly shows that the Ref-cSi design has a pronounced processing cost advantage, that is offset only by strong efficiency increases in the PVD-SHJ and IBC-SHJ designs. The other SHJ designs need further efficiency improvements to approach Ref-cSi module costs. At similar efficiency, the SHJ would be more expensive compared to the c-Si module, due to the high cell and for the IBC design also module costs.As shown in Fig. 13(a), module cost is quite sensitive to changes in module efficiency.

        <p>Wafer prices are strongly linked to polysilicon prices, which have shown to be quite volatile. Current (June 2015) spot prices for wafers are about 1.01 USD/wafer, with polysilicon prices at around 15.7 USD/kg [61]. After many silicon producers shutting down the last 1.5 years due to an oversupply, prices were estimated to stabilize and rise slightly to a price of about 20-25 USD/kg [62]. More recently, polysilicon capacity was increased, leading to the possibility of another polysilicon oversupply situation with further price decreases. Polysilicon price is thus quite uncertain. Taking into account the price range of polysilicon for the last 5 years and possible further price decreases, we investigated the effect on the overall results of a wafer price in the range of 0.60 USD/wafer to 2.0 USD/wafer. Fig. 13(b) shows that all designs are quite sensitive to variation in wafer cost. The effect of changes in wafer cost is similar for all devices, although the effect is more pronounced as the module efficiency decreases, as the wafer cost contributes more to the overall costs at lower efficiencies. This is especially apparent in the results for the Ref-cSi module, and to a lesser degree for the ALD-SHJ and NE-SHJ modules.Wafer prices are strongly linked to polysilicon prices, which have shown to be quite volatile.

        <p>Another strong contributor to overall cell manufacturing cost is the price of silver paste used for metallization. As shown in Fig. 12, silver prices are quite volatile, with prices ranging from about 500 USD/kg to over 1700 USD/kg over the last five years, with a current (Oct 2015) price of about 520 USD/kg. This silver price variation could account for very large increases in the cost of silver paste, to almost 1500 and 2000 USD/kg for high and low temperature paste, respectively.Another strong contributor to overall cell manufacturing cost is the price of silver paste used for metallization.

        <p>Price variation can of course occur not only for silver, but also for all other material consumables that are required to produce the solar cells and modules. Therefore, we studied the effect of variation in the prices of cell consumables other than silver paste and wafers, and of module materials on the overall results. As seen in Fig. 13(d), the effect of changes in cell consumable prices is limited, as these consumables only account for around 2-5% of SHJ module prices and 9% of the Ref-cSi module. The results are however very sensitive to changes in the cost of module materials (see Fig. 13(e)), as they contribute around 30-40% of total module cost.Price variation can of course occur not only for silver, but also for all other material consumables that are required to produce the solar cells and modules.

        <p>The main aim of this study is to perform a bottom-up analysis of the relative cost of different silicon heterojunction (SHJ) based PV modules, and to compare current and prospective costs of these modules with those of a conventional monocrystalline silicon module. The aim is to develop a methodology that allows for ex-ante screening of R&amp;D cell concepts. We performed a life cycle costing analysis to analyze in detail the cost structure of the production of PV modules, and found current SHJ modules to be comparable in price compared to conventional monocrystalline silicon modules, but cost penalties incurred by using more expensive materials need high efficiencies to be offset. Thus, especially designs that minimize the use of lowtemperature silver paste benefit from the efficiency advantage of heterojunction technology.The main aim of this study is to perform a bottom-up analysis of the relative cost of different silicon heterojunction (SHJ) based PV modules, and to compare current and prospective costs of these modules with those of a conventional monocrystalline silicon module.

        <p>The life cycle costing (LCC) method shows its' usefulness in determining the contribution of each process and material input to the overall production cost of different cell and module designs. Our research has confirmed that for all designs investigated wafer and metallization contribute the majority of overall cell production costs, while for complete modules, the module materials are also a very significant cost factor. Reductions in wafer thickness, silver paste usage, or substitution of silver with copper-based metallization allows for significant cost reductions. The strong effect of module efficiency on module price (USD=W p ) however shows that changes in cell and module design that have a negative effect on module efficiency will likely result in a relative cost increase. Furthermore, as Fig. 13 (a) shows, the efficiency advantage of the studied SHJ designs is the main reason for there lower production costs (in terms of USD/W p ). This indicates that: (a) the uncertainty in cell and module efficiency for the SHJ designs results in significant uncertainty of the overall result (see Figs. 13 and14), (b) changes in cell processing that decrease cell efficiency are likely to result in cost increases, even if they reduce cell processing costs, (c) accurate cost calculations for SHJ cell concepts should preferably rely on cell efficiency data from gathered from (pilot) production lines.The life cycle costing (LCC) method shows its' usefulness in determining the contribution of each process and material input to the overall production cost of different cell and module designs.

        <p>To calculate the wafer production cost, we performed an LCC analysis of wafer production from silica to sawn wafers. Our model results for current wafers (1.03 USD/pc) results in slightly higher costs compared to the current wafer spot price (1.01 USD/pc) [61]. This likely is the result of the fact that the life-cycle data on silicon production we used for our calculations is already some years old (from 2007), although we have updated this as much as possible, as progress has been made especially in reducing the energy budget of silicon production. A different issue with our model is that we have used a single cost model for the wafer used, e.g. we have not distinguished between n-type and p-type wafers. It is sometimes assumed that n-type wafers are likely to be more expensive compared to p-type wafers because of lower yields, more complex processing and added capital expenses, however this has been disputed [18].To calculate the wafer production cost, we performed an LCC analysis of wafer production from silica to sawn wafers. Our model results for current wafers (1.03 USD/pc) results in slightly higher costs compared to the current wafer spot price (1.01 USD/pc) [61].

        <p>In PV industry and research, it is common knowledge that metallization is a main contributor to PV module costs. R&amp;D on alternative metallization schemes is therefore a very active field of research. The amount of silver used per wafer has already dropped significantly [35], a trend which is expected to continue. Our results indicate that a projected reduction in silver use per cell [35] could decrease the costs of the silver-based SHJ modules studied here by about 6% for most designs, but up to 11% for a design with high silver consumption. As conventional c-Si cells use cheaper silver paste, containing less silver, this cost reduction potential is smaller (À 4%) for this technology.In PV industry and research, it is common knowledge that metallization is a main contributor to PV module costs.

        <p>Aside from material use reduction, replacement of silver with copper is also being heavily researched, mainly through research on copper-plating. Copper offers similar conductivity, at only a fraction ($ 2%) of the cost. Furthermore, the supply of copper is less constrained, although not impervious to price volatility. Our results show that silver substitution could decrease module cost by an additional 4-7% for SHJ modules, or 6% for c-Si modules. In our prospective designs, the contribution of metallization is already low, as we assume that paste consumption per wafer to substantially decrease.Aside from material use reduction, replacement of silver with copper is also being heavily researched, mainly through research on copper-plating.

        <p>The adoption of copper in the manufacturing process is however not without issues: copper rapidly oxidizes during thermal curing, and can diffuse into the silicon cell substrate [35,53,52]. Recent results have however shown that contact curing can be performed with minimal oxidation in inert or low-oxygen curing atmospheres [52,50], or in normal atmospheres using a specially developed paste [53]. Furthermore, the ITO layer applied in SHJ solar cells is stated to be an effective barrier to metal diffusion [64]. Especially copper-plated contacts however, in conjunction with a nickel seed layer and silver capping layer, show prospects for high efficiency SHJ solar cells [54].The adoption of copper in the manufacturing process is however not without issues: copper rapidly oxidizes during thermal curing, and can diffuse into the silicon cell substrate [35,53,52].

        <p>An issue with our current model for metallization costs is the coststructure of metallization pastes. There is limited information on the cost of these pastes, but the available data shows that these pastes are much more expensive than pure silver. This indicates that a significant fraction of metallization paste cost is non-silver related (460 and 580 USD/kg for high-and low-temperature paste). For aluminium pastes, this does not seem to be the case, as these pastes are much cheaper ($ 50 USD/kg). It does however seem to indicate that the cost in front-side metallization paste (especially low-temperature) cannot only be reduced by reducing the silver content or replacing silver with another metal. Alternative forms of metallization, such as SmartWire Connection Technology [65], inkjet or stencil printing or electroplating could possibly offer further metallization cost reductions.An issue with our current model for metallization costs is the coststructure of metallization pastes.

        <p>From a cost perspective, replacement of ITO has very limited benefits, as the amount of indium needed for the thin transparent conductive oxides is very low. Alternative TCO's that are cheaper but less conductive, are likelier to increase the module cost due to decreased cell efficiency. As one of the options, we have also modelled replacement of ITO with ZnO, which offers a very modest cost decrease.From a cost perspective, replacement of ITO has very limited benefits, as the amount of indium needed for the thin transparent conductive oxides is very low.

        <p>At current price levels (June 2015, 750 USD/kg), ITO contributes about 0.8-1.8% of cell costs and 0.5-1.1% of total module costs. As we have possibly overestimated the cost of ITO target material (see Section 3.2.2), this contribution could be smaller. Thus, from a cost perspective, ITO replacement does not seem to be that important. At a 100% price increase for ITO, the contribution increases slightly to 1.0-2.2% of module costs. The development of alternative TCOs should however still be researched, as the availability of indium could become a concern [59,60].At current price levels (June 2015, 750 USD/kg), ITO contributes about 0.8-1.8% of cell costs and 0.5-1.1% of total module costs.

        <p>Our results indicate that module materials already contribute a large fraction of overall module cost, and will likely contribute the majority of module costs as wafer and cell production become cheaper. Cost reduction possibilities in module design are likely limited, as the production of the materials used is already very mature, and there is thus limited possibility for technological learning. For current modules, main costs are glass, frame and backsheet. Prospective glass-glass modules can be somewhat cheaper compared to modules with an aluminium frame, because of the replacement of the backsheet with a sheet of glass. The cost of the glass on the backside of the prospective modules is likely overestimated, as lower quality glass can be applied here compared to the front-side. This could significantly lower the price of the backside of the module. Furthermore, the costs calculated here are based on monofacial efficiencies, and thus do not reflect the additional energy yield than can be obtained from bifacial PV modules.Our results indicate that module materials already contribute a large fraction of overall module cost, and will likely contribute the majority of module costs as wafer and cell production become cheaper.

        <p>Our results show that silicon heterojunction (SHJ) technology offers the potential for cost reductions in PV manufacturing compared to conventional crystalline silicon solar cells and modules, especially for prospective PV modules. Heterojunction module production costs were found to range from 0.48 to 0.56 USD/W p , compared to 0.50 USD/W p for a conventional monocrystalline silicon module. Heterojunction modules incur a strong cost penalty because of the requirement for low-temperature silver paste. High-efficiency SHJ designs that minimize the use of this paste can be competitive with standard crystalline silicon PV modules. As the designs studied are conceptual, the validity of the results will strongly benefit from more accurate determination of the efficiency of SHJ cells and modules from large-scale production. Variation of material prices can also have a large influence on the cost of SHJ modules, but these variations will likely affect all designs similarly and thus not alter the relative results.Our results show that silicon heterojunction (SHJ) technology offers the potential for cost reductions in PV manufacturing compared to conventional crystalline silicon solar cells and modules, especially for prospective PV modules.

        <p>Our results confirm that the choice of metallization has a substantial impact on the cost of SHJ modules compared to conventional crystalline silicon modules. This is mainly due to the high cost of low-temperature paste needed for SHJ cell processing, and the increased amount of paste required due to its lower as-cured conductivity. This results in higher cell costs for SHJ designs (USD/cell), that is offset partly by the high efficiency of heterojunction technology.Our results confirm that the choice of metallization has a substantial impact on the cost of SHJ modules compared to conventional crystalline silicon modules.

        <p>Our prospective analysis indicates that a reduction in paste consumption and replacement of silver with copper paste could alleviate this problem, e.g., the cost-advantage of SHJ cells becomes less dependent on the efficiency advantage. However, these results are based on the assumption that progress in reduction of silver consumption is also applicable to SHJ cells. A more promising approach seems to be the replacement of screen printed silver grids with copperelectroplated contact, minimizing the amount of silver used in SHJ cells.Our prospective analysis indicates that a reduction in paste consumption and replacement of silver with copper paste could alleviate this problem, e.g., the cost-advantage of SHJ cells becomes less dependent on the efficiency advantage.

        <p>As the prospective cost reductions that we have modelled are very dependent on reductions and eventual elimination of silver use in SHJ cells, further research should keep addressing these issues, by establishing a metallization process based on copper that is compatible with industrial scale production without adding complexity to the production process.
