        <p>Machining operation optimization improves the quality of the product, reduces cost, enhances overall efficiency by reducing human error, and enables consistent and efficient operation. It is a vital decision-making process and achieves the best solution within constraints. It reduces reliance on machine-tool technicians and handbooks to identify cutting parameters, as a lack of awareness of the optimal combination of machining parameters leads to several machining inefficiencies. Subsequently, the optimization of the machining process is more useful for units of production, particularly machining units. In multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems, weights of importance are assigned, mostly identical. But, nowadays, the weights assignment techniques have received a lot of consideration from the professionals and researchers in MOO problems. Various techniques are developed to assign weights of significance to responses in MOO. The Entropy weights method (EWM) continues to work pleasingly across diverse machining operations to allocate objective weights. In this paper, a literature review is conducted to classify the articles on EWM applications in machining operations. The categorization proposal for the EWM reviews included 65 academic articles from different journals, books, and conferences since the year 2009. The EWM applications were separated into 18 categories of conventional and non-conventional machining operations. The implementation procedure of EWM is presented with an example along with method development. Scholarly articles in the EWM applications are further inferred based on (1) implementation of EWM in different machining operations, (2) MOO methods used with entropy weights in machining operations, (3) application of entropy weights by citation index and publication year, and (4) entropy weights applications in other fields. The review paper provided constructive</p>
        <p>1.</p>
        <p>It has long been recognized that cutting conditions should be chosen to maximize the economics of machining operations, as measured by efficiency, the overall manufacturing cost per part, or some other acceptable criteria. But, for an optimum range of cutting conditions and tools, production companies have long relied on the skill and expertise of shop-floor machine-tool technicians. The manufacturing units are still using handbooks to pick cutting parameters and tools at the process level. The most detrimental consequence of such an unscientific method is lowered efficiency attributable to the suboptimal application of machining capacities [1]. The optimization in machining operations is one of the vital decision-making processes. It achieves the best design or solution out of the available solutions within constraints. Machining process optimization results in more effective operation, removing unnecessary steps, and automating the overall process to save time, reduce mistakes and eliminate repetitive work. The improved productivity by process optimization can be of significant help, particularly for continuous operations, the ones that take place daily. It's always good for workers to function more effectively, assisted by the right software resources. A lack of clarity of the optimal combination of machining parameters causes many inefficiencies in machining operations [2]. Consequently, the machining operation optimization becomes more useful for manufacturing, especially machining units. As optimization leads to more flexibility, to use the right software solutions with more accurate information and optimal combination of machining parameters also enhances production and quality with additional profits [3].</p>
        <p>The multi-objective optimization (MOO) techniques utilize response weights in their process of converting multiple responses into single response value (composite score or performance index). These weights to responses participate uniquely in obtaining the composite index of responses. It's very important for the decision-maker that he must have an understanding of the true meaning of weights and its computation. So, the involvement of weights of importance in MOO problems is a crucial phase of the entire optimization process. The weights to responses in MOO can be assigned in different ways, such as equal, subjective, objective, and combinations of objective and subjective weights. It is a significant step in optimization because concluding results mainly depend upon allocated weights, but generally, weights are assigned equally [3]. The subjective weight calculation involves the judgment of the decision-maker (engineer, manager, or any other person participates in the research or have experience of the process or operation). The subjective weights obtained replicate the personal opinion of the decision-maker and influence the concluding results of the optimization problem. The subjective weights calculation methods include such as Ranking weighting [4], Direct weighting method [5], Allocation of points [6], Simple attribute rating technique, SMAR-TER [7], Swing [8], Trade-off [9], Pairwise comparison [10], AHP [11], the Least square method [12], Eigenvector method [13], Delphi method [14], Pattern method and Consistent matrix analysis. The computation of objective weights involves mathematical models or algorithms based upon the investigation of preliminary data, and there is no involvement of the decision-maker by neglecting skewed opinion information. The objective weights calculation techniques comprise for example Entropy method [3,15], Vertical and Horizontal method [16], TOPSIS [17], Variant coefficient [18], Multi-objective optimization method, Multiple correlation coefficient [19], Principal component analysis method [20] and so on [21]. The combinations of weights calculations involve both ways objective and subjective. These methods include Multiplication synthesis and Additive synthesis etc. The weighting methods are also classified based on internal and external types [22].</p>
        <p>In MOO decision-making problems, weights of significance are assigned, mostly alike. Nevertheless, the weights assignment methods have been established by professionals and researchers. Various techniques were developed to assign weights of significance to responses in MOO. This review aims to provide a collective information of Entropy weights methodology applied to different machining operations which compute the objective weights. Further, it enables calculating the relative weights of responses in a simple, uncomplicated way and is an immensely successful practice for evaluating indicators. Indeed, we can recognize that the EWM allows a quantitative assessment of the efficiency of machining responses. The EWM also can detect the weak impact of some unusual machining attributes and makes the outcome of the assessment gradually precise and rational. The EWM methodology can be used for various fields and thoroughly collection of EWM applications in machining operations can be helpful for the practitioners and researchers. The remaining paper is categorized into five parts. Section 2 presents a concise outline and the execution of EWM. Section 3 explains the structure of articles collected for the study. papers into four new groups. Lastly, Section 6 briefly explains the concluding statement.</p>
        <p>Shannon and Weaver proposed EWM in 1947 [23], and Zeleny has emphasized further developments in 1982. The EWM is utilized to establish the objective weights of the attributes/ responses. The probability theory is utilized to compute uncertain information (Entropy). It determines the importance of every response, not including any thoughtfulness of the preference of the decider (engineer or manager). The EWM works on the principle that superior weight indicator information is more constructive than the lower indicator information. This method includes first deciding objectives (decision matrix) and then calculations of the normalized decision matrix, probability of the attribute/response to take place, the entropy value of attribute/response, degrees of divergence (average information contained) by each response and after that entropy weight [3,24]. The following steps are taken by this method to compute objective weights.</p>
        <p>Step 1 Objective</p>
        <p>Alternatives/experiments are worked out with suitable evaluation criteria/responses allied with it (e.g., design of experiments).</p>
        <p>The decision template is given away in Eq. (1). Every row of decision template or matrix is allotted to one experiment and all columns to one response (e.g., MRR, Ra, tool life, etc.). Accordingly, the e ij of the decision template 'DT' [e ij ; i ¼ 1, 2, …, a no. of experiments (n), j ¼ 1,2, ..., no. of responses (m)] are contributions for decision template or matrix. DT ¼ 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 q 11 q 12 q 1j q 1m q 21 q 22 q 2j q 2m q i1 q i2 q ij q im q n1 q n2 q nj q nm 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 5</p>
        <p>(1)</p>
        <p>Step 3 Normalization</p>
        <p>The linear normalization technique is utilized to make the experimental data of 'DT' dimensionless due to several units of the responses. Eq. ( 2) is used for beneficial response, e.g., MRR and Eq. ( 3) for a non-beneficial reaction, e.g., Ra and it is noticeable that normalized decision matrix NDM ij 2½0; 1.</p>
        <p>Step 4 Probability and Entropy</p>
        <p>The probability of the response ðPr ij Þ to happen, be computed by Eq. ( 4) and Eq. ( 5) is utilized to attain the Entropy ðEn j Þ of the jth response.</p>
        <p>where Y ¼ 1 log e ðnÞ is a stable expression, n belongs to no. of experiments and value of En j lies between zero and one.</p>
        <p>Step 5 Divergence and Entropy Weights Eq. ( 6) is utilized to compute the degrees of divergence (Div j ), and Eq. ( 7) obtains the entropy weight (Ew) of the jth response.</p>
        <p>The MOO problem from [25] is taken to understand the steps involved in computing the entropy weights. This problem is Step 1 Objectives</p>
        <p>The objectives, as per step 1, are considered. The MOO includes the maximization of MRR and minimization of Ra and machining time [25].</p>
        <p>The decision matrix, according to step 2, is shown in Table 1, and it consists of nine experiments and three responses viz. material removal rate (MRR), surface roughness (Ra), and time as per Eq. ( 1).</p>
        <p>The linear normalization technique is utilized to make the experimental data of Table 1 dimensionless due to several units of the responses. Eq. ( 2) is used for a beneficial response, and Table 1 shows the maximum and minimum values of the responses MRR, Ra, and time. In this case, the maximum amount of MRR is 471. Each experiment value of the response (MRR) is divided by 471, e.g., experiment no. 1; 188 471 ¼ 0:3992; similarly, other values are calculated and shown in Table 2.</p>
        <p>Eq. ( 3) is utilized for a non-beneficial response, e.g., Ra and time. The minimum value of Ra is 0.502, and this value divided by each experiment value of the response Ra, e.g., experiment no. 1, 0:502 1:144 ¼ 0:4388; and for time 25 38 ¼ 0:6579. The normalized decision matrix is shown in Table 2.</p>
        <p>Step 4 Probability and Entropy Probability of the criterion (Pr ij ) computed as per Eq. ( 4). The sum of all the normalized values from experiment numbers 1 to 9 are shown in Table 2 at the bottom row. The probability of the MRR, Ra, and time is computed by dividing the value of every experiment by the sum of the responses, e.g., MRR of experiment number 1, Similarly, other values of the probability are calculated and are shown in Table 3.</p>
        <p>The Entropy of each response MRR, Ra, and time is computed by Eq. (5). The term Y in Eq. ( 5) is calculated as Y ¼</p>
        <p>And the Entropy En j calculations are shown in Table 4 at serial number III.</p>
        <p>The degree of divergence is computed by Eq. ( 6) as shown in Table 4 at serial number IV, e.g., experiment number 1 of the response: MRR; 1 À 0:9846 ¼ 0:0154 Ra; 1 À 0:9771 ¼ 0:0229 Time; 1 À 0:99486 ¼ 0:0052</p>
        <p>The sum of divergence is shown in Table 4 at serial number V, e.g. 0:0154 þ 0:0229 þ 0:0052 ¼ 0:0424 Eq. ( 7) is utilized to obtain entropy weights as shown in Table 4</p>
        <p>Followings are the advantages of the EWM approach:</p>
        <p>The EWM calculates the relative weights of responses in a simple, uncomplicated, and impartial way.</p>
        <p>The EWM strategy for calculating weight is a hugely successful technique for assessing indicators. This approach is established as adequately consistent in identifying together contrast intensity and divergence of responses in addition to figuring their weights suitably. The EWM proposes if the accessible information is sufficient or not, and if not, then supplementary information should be required. As a result, EWM fetches the model, the modeller, and the decision-maker nearer.</p>
        <p>The EWM allows a quantitative appraisal of effectiveness and advantage/cost responses. The EWM for computing of weight considers sufficiently the data of qualities of all the observing segments provided to adjust the relationship among various assessing objects. The EWM debilitates the weak impact of some unusual attributes and makes the outcome of assessment progressively precise and sensible.</p>
        <p>The conventional EWM spotlights on the separation amid information to decide quality weights. If a response can separate the information more adequately, it is specified a superior weight.</p>
        <p>The EWM strategy delivers more different coefficient esteems for responses. It's suitable for the Entropy strategy to handle the fundamental disagreement between the responses in decision-making [26].</p>
        <p>Apart from the various benefits, the downsides of the EWM are as follows:</p>
        <p>The EWM's possible drawback connected to appropriate problem sizing, e.g., the decision matrix encloses an adequately massive set of alternatives [27].</p>
        <p>The EWM computed weights lacking specialist verdict, and it only considers entropy values. The EWM does not provide any participation in the designer's preferences.</p>
        <p>The weights of responses computed by the standard deviation technique are more inclusive and persuasive than EWM. Because, this method judges not only the quantity of information every response holds, however, as well the impact of every response on decision-making. At the same time, the EWM considers no description of the reciprocated associations amongst responses [28].</p>
        <p>The effectiveness of EWM in decision making reported that the discretion of the EWM is problematic as it pays no attention to rank discrimination [29].</p>
        <p>The EWM developed over time and is implemented in different areas of engineering and other fields. EWM contribute a vital role in calculating objective weights of significance in MOO response of different machining process. Table 5 presents thorough progress of the Entropy technique application in diverse fields.</p>
        <p>The cross-entropy technique is utilized for the significance of optimization and sampling is a Monte Carlo technique. It applies to equally combinatorial and continuous problems, with either a static or noisy objective. Table 6 presents a crossentropy technique applied to different machining operations. Table 6 also includes minimum cross-entropy, normalized cross-entropy, fuzzy entropy control applications to various machining operations.</p>
        <p>The structure of the review of the literature is shown in Fig. 1.</p>

The analysis of papers briefly revealed in each section as per machining operation, and each machining operation is summarized by specific Tables containing workpiece material, input parameters or responses, and MOO methods used.</p>
        <p>The machining operations based upon electric discharge have considered the mainly admired topic in Entropy weights applications as 46% of articles belong to them. The electrical discharge machining (EDM) covers more than a few specific machining operations, including wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM), electric discharge diamond grinding (EDDG), electric discharge drilling (EDD), electric discharge drilling (EDD), electro-chemical spark machining operations (ECSM).</p>
        <p>EDM belongs to a non-conventional machining operation in which the tool has direct contact with the workpiece. At the same time, þve-polarity specified to the workpiece and evepolarity assigned to the tool, which is generally copper or brass. The workpiece sinks into a dielectric fluid, and the electrode touched to the workpiece, so there is some metal erosion. The research studies which have the application of entropy weights in EDM operations are presented in Table 7.</p>
        <p>EDM has a share of 26% from all reviewed machining operations, as shown in Fig. 4. The multi-objective combination of MRR, tool wear rate, and Ra was studied by [71e78], and the higher entropy weight assignment is to MRR-48.2% and lower entropy weight to TWR-3.7% [65]. The gap and radial overcut were considered in addition to MRR, tool wear rate, and Ra by [66], and the maximum entropy weight assignment to Ra-25.8%. The MRR is considered as a response almost in all EDM MOO articles after by tool or electrode wear rate TWR and Ra. The maximum entropy weight assignment was to MRR (87%) when three or more than three responses were considered in the MOO [67] after by MRR-48.2% [65], and the minimum entropy weight assignment is to TWR-3.7% [65]. The GRA method was utilized a maximum number of times to get a composite score in EDM operations with entropy weight assignment after by TOPSIS and VIKOR methods. The Taguchi and RSM methods are frequently utilized for the design of experiments, as shown in Table 7.</p>
        <p>It also belongs to a non-conventional machining operation invented in the 1960s for making the die from hardened steel. In this process, the tool electrode is of brass or copper wire, which is passing continuously through two spools, which works as holding and guiding the wire onto the workpiece; the process is carried out in the existence of dielectric fluid. It has a 12% contribution in the reviewed articles, as shown in Fig. 4. The WEDM responses were optimized simultaneously while using entropy weights. The responses include metal MRR, Ra, AE, G, kerf width, cutting rate, wire wear rate, and tooth width, as shown in Table 8. The Ra and MRR were optimized concurrently [82] in WEDM using brass wire and maximum entropy weight assignment to Ra-60%. The MRR is identified as a maximum considered response almost in all WEDM MOO studies except [83], followed by Ra and Kerf width. The maximum entropy weight assignment was to MRR-70% when three or more than three responses were considered in MOO [84] after by MRR-25% [85], and the minimum entropy weight assignment is to Ra-10% [84]. The GRA method was utilized almost in all studies of WEDM to get composite scores except [86], which utilizes the MOORA method, as shown in Table 8. Pramanick et al.

        <p>The following features are used to describe the organization of EWM publications in machining operations: (1) application of EWM in different machining operations, (2) multi-objective optimization methods used with entropy weights in machining operations, (3) application of entropy weights by citation index and publication year, (4) entropy weights applications in other fields.</p>
        <p>The use of entropy weights in machining operations divided into two groups conventional and non-conventional, as shown in Fig. 2. The conventional machining has a 28% share, and non-conventional machining has a 78% share of the collected articles on entropy weights. Further, entropy weight applications are divided into other groups, as shown in Fig. 5. It shows the contribution of the different machining operations. The electrical discharge based machining has the maximum share of 46%, followed by turning-based machining 17%, laser-based machining 14%, CNC-based machining 11%, milling-based machining 6%, drilling-based machining 5% and ultrasonic machining 2%.</p>
        <p>In MOO problems, different methods were used to get composite scores. Various methods utilized with an application of EWM are shown in Fig. 6. The GRA has a share of 50% and used a maximum number of times out of 14 methods. The TOPSIS method has a share of 11%, followed by ANN 8%, VIKOR 6%, WASPAS, and AHP 4% each, fuzzy logic, and MOORA 3% each. The VMD, PSO, SAW, ELECTURE and PCA have only a 1% share.</p>
        <p>Fig. 7 shows valuable information regarding publication types in various resources. The collected review articles are divided into five categories SCI journals, Scopus journals, non-SCI &amp; Scopus journals, conference articles, and book chapters. Out of the reviewed 65 articles, maximum articles have been published in SCI journals (26), followed by Scopus journals (20) and in non-SCI &amp; Scopus journals (13). Four articles published in different conferences and 2 in book chapters.</p>
        <p>Fig. 8 provides valuable information concerning the articles published year-wise. Since 2009, there was a substantial expansion in articles published on entropy weights applications in machining operations. The year 2015 and 2019 tops the list with a 15% share, out of the total article published since 2009. The year 2009 is assumed as a starting year of the reviewing process, which only contributes 1% of articles. The other year-wise contributions can be seen from Fig. 8. The year 2020 only shows a 2% contribution because the publication process is still going on during the paper writing and publication procedure.</p>
        <p>The EWM other than machining operations were also applied in many fields of industrial engineering, human resource, and management. Some of the areas of applications of EWM are presented in Table 20 for the knowledge of future researchers. Kumar et al. [3], compared the concert of various responses in MOO while assigning equal weights, entropy weights, and AHP weights. The results reveal that the AHP performed better. Ren et al. [109], also used AHP and EWM in CNC milling operation refer to Table 15.</p>
        <p>This paper reviewed entropy weights applications in machining operations to categorize and construe the For future researchers, the example of the MOO problem was solved in 
            <rs type="software">Excel</rs> (MS office) with calculations of all the steps. The calculation of entropy weights on 
            <rs type="software">Excel</rs> is very effortless, logical, and has higher computational simplicity. This approach is very favorable for researchers/engineers/ managers, even for a programmer of websites or developer of online calculator/software working on EWM growth. Since the inception of EWM, there are several advances in methodology and is applied in different fields of engineering and management. The fuzzy entropy method was used to obtain entropy weights in a vague environment. The crossentropy method has been developed and evaluated in machining processes. The modified multi-objective cross-entropy method was successfully applied based on a new approach for addressing constraints. The EWM combined with subjective influences such as the AHP method. The grey entropy technique was utilized to improve GRA. The intuitionistic fuzzy entropy weights are progressed along with extension theory, and the enhanced EWM developed with comprehensive index weights. Still, the research is in progress for the expansion of the method.
        </p>
        <p>The EWM applications in non-conventional machining operations are 72% and 28% in conventional machining. All the machining operations are further divided into 18 processes, and 26% of papers belong to EDM operation followed by WEDM and conventional turning 12%. The electric discharge-based machining group contributed 46%, followed by turning-based machining 17%, and laser-based machining 14%. Fourteen MOO methods are identified in different machining operations and the GRA has a maximum contribution of 50%, followed by TOPSIS 11%, and ANN 8%. The starting year of the review process only contributed 2% articles, and the maximum number belongs to the year 2015 and Table 19 e Application of EWM in "conventional milling".</p>
        <p>2019, followed by the year 2016, 14%. Indian authors contributed 82% of papers, followed by China 6%. Only six countries contributed papers related to EWM application in machining operations.</p>
        <p>The material used in experiments, input variables, responses, and entropy weights assigned in different machining operations will help for the future design of experiments. Still, there is more attention to be paid on the application of entropy weights as the research completed on EWM in machining is too low comparatively. Still, there are many machining operations in which EWM is not used, and many processes have only one paper, such as ECSM, EDD, EDDG, and ultrasonic machining. The EWM has applications in various other fields, as presented in Table 20. The insights recognized by EWM in machining operations will help channel future research efforts of researchers and practitioners.</p>
        <p>Further, the entropy weights can be merged with subjective influences and can be utilized in MOO problems. The weights can be assigned to the output parameters with EWM, equal, and subjective weights, and the attained results can be compared for better achievement of the objectives. Still, only a few studies were available of MOO in which results were compared with different weight assignment. Besides, it endeavors to furnish the user/researcher with adaptability to apply EWM in MOO problems for the betterment of the outcome. The review of EWM will help to establish novel directions in MOO of machining operations.</p>
