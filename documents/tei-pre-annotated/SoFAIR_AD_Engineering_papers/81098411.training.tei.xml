        <p>The Anaerolineae lineage of Chloroflexi had been identified as one of the core microbial populations in anaerobic digesters; however, the ecological role of the Anaerolineae remains uncertain due to the scarcity of isolates and annotated genome sequences. Our previous metatranscriptional analysis revealed this prevalent population that showed minimum involvement in the main pathways of cellulose hydrolysis and subsequent methanogenesis in the thermophilic cellulose fermentative consortium (TCF).The Anaerolineae lineage of Chloroflexi had been identified as one of the core microbial populations in anaerobic digesters; however, the ecological role of the Anaerolineae remains uncertain due to the scarcity of isolates and annotated genome sequences.

        <p>In further pursuit, five high-quality curated draft genomes (&gt;98 % completeness) of this population, including two affiliated with the inaccessible lineage of SBR1031, were retrieved by sequence-based multi-dimensional coverage binning. Comparative genomic analyses revealed versatile genetic capabilities for carbohydrate-based fermentative lifestyle including key genes catalyzing cellulose hydrolysis in Anaerolinea phylotypes. However, the low transcriptional activities of carbohydrate-active genes (CAGs) excluded cellulolytic capability as the selective advantage for their prevalence in the community. Instead, a substantially active type VI pili (Tfp) assembly was observed. Expression of the tight adherence protein on the Tfp indicated its function for cellular attachment which was further testified to be more likely related to cell aggregation other than cellulose surface adhesion. Meanwhile, this Tfp structure was found not contributing to syntrophic methanogenesis. Members of the SBR1031 encoded key genes for acetogenic dehydrogenation that may allow ethanol to be used as a carbon source.In further pursuit, five high-quality curated draft genomes (&gt;98 % completeness) of this population, including two affiliated with the inaccessible lineage of SBR1031, were retrieved by sequence-based multi-dimensional coverage binning.

        <p>The common prevalence of Anaerolineae in anaerobic digesters should be originated from advantageous cellular adhesiveness enabled by Tfp assembly other than its potential as cellulose degrader or anaerobic syntrophs.The common prevalence of Anaerolineae in anaerobic digesters should be originated from advantageous cellular adhesiveness enabled by Tfp assembly other than its potential as cellulose degrader or anaerobic syntrophs.</p>
        <p>Anaerobic digestion, as a key environmental technology for resource recovery, is empowered by microbial reactions involving a complex community. Anaerolineae (also known as subphylum I of Chloroflexi phylum) had been identified as one of the core populations, and for most of the cases, the dominating proportion of anaerobic digestive systems [1,2]; however, its roles in anaerobic digestion process remain uncertain due to a general lack of sequenced genomes.Anaerobic digestion, as a key environmental technology for resource recovery, is empowered by microbial reactions involving a complex community.

        <p>A series of metabolic reactions such as hydrolysis, acidogenesis (fermentation), acetogenesis, and methanogenesis are involved in the process of anaerobic digestion. Normally, the Anaerolineae linage has been regarded as a typical fermentative population within the community. As hydrogen could be produced during fermentation of soluble sugar, researchers also speculated that Anaerolineae acted as anaerobic syntrophs which conduct reverse electron transfer via tightly coupled mutualistic interaction with methanogens [1]; however the validity of Anaerolineae in syntrophic methanogenesis is not yet confirmed. Additionally, the common ability to grow on starch (alpha-glucan polysaccharides) [3,4] and the recent discovery of cellulolytic representative Ornatilinea apprima [5] is attracting increasing research interest on the importance of this lineage in the bottlenecking polysaccharide hydrolysis step of anaerobic digestion. Moreover, the flow velocity within the digester, especially in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB), may select organisms which can adhere to each other to form well-settling granular sludge. This widely distributed Anaerolineae population had been reported as both the backbone of sludge granules [6] and the causative agent of filamentous bulking in UASB [2,7].A series of metabolic reactions such as hydrolysis, acidogenesis (fermentation), acetogenesis, and methanogenesis are involved in the process of anaerobic digestion.

        <p>Currently ten strains had been isolated in Anaerolineae class [3][4][5][8][9][10][11]. These representative strains isolated from anaerobic sludge treating various pollutants help to resolve the phylogenetic composition of this lineage into eight genera representing one family of Anaerolineaceae in one single order of Anaerolineales. Phenotypic comparison of the cultivated strains identifies a number of common traits including filamentous morphology as well as non-motile, non-sporulation, and gram-negative characteristics [3][4][5][8][9][10][11]. In contrast, genomic information is quite limited for this class; indeed there is only one finished complete genome, Anaerolinea thermophila UNI-1 (short as UNI-1 in subsequent discussion), available in IMG 4.0 (up to 12 Jan 2016). Further recovery of interpretative genomes is requisite to disclose the ecological importance of Anaerolineae as a core population in anaerobic digestion process.Currently ten strains had been isolated in Anaerolineae class [3][4][5][8][9][10][11].

        <p>Rapid accumulation of next generation sequencing (NGS) data from various metagenomes had made genome reconstruction independent from isolation possible [12][13][14][15]. Such cultivation-independent binning method based on multi-dimensional abundance profile had provided initial genomic insight of the metabolic styles of the previously inaccessible phyla-like TM6 and OP8 etc. [15][16][17]. This creative approach had helped to expand the evolutionary boundaries of Dehalococcoidia lineage of the Chloroflexi from obligate organohalide respiration to fermentation, CO 2 fixation, and acetogenesis [18,19]; however, these frontier work did not emphasize on the lineage of Anaerolineae which is important in the operation of anaerobic reactors.Rapid accumulation of next generation sequencing (NGS) data from various metagenomes had made genome reconstruction independent from isolation possible [12][13][14][15].

        <p>In the present study, with a purpose to resolve the special physiochemical features that support accumulation of Anaerolineae in the thermophilic cellulose-fermenting reactor, we utilized a sequence-based metagenomic binning to recover high-quality genomes from Anaerolineae lineage. Comparative genomics were conducted to reveal specific genetic traits related with key functions in anaerobic digestion. Beneficial ecological functions of Anaerolineae within the community were inferred based on the expressed genes and pathways identified by metatranscriptomic sequencing and then testified in experiments. Information obtained here would add a great amount of contextual information to the ecological importance of Anaerolineae in anaerobic digestive systems and help to resolve the intra-physiological differences among the uncultivated majority of this lineage.In the present study, with a purpose to resolve the special physiochemical features that support accumulation of Anaerolineae in the thermophilic cellulose-fermenting reactor, we utilized a sequence-based metagenomic binning to recover high-quality genomes from Anaerolineae lineage.

        <p>Metagenomic DNA extracted from sludge samples collected from the same thermophilic anaerobic cellulosedegrading reactor but at two different time points [the short-term enrichment at 120 days of enrichment (SE) and the long-term enrichment at 549 days (LE)] were deeply sequenced to construct the two differential coverage for genome reconstruction. The 129,535,600 high-quality reads obtained from illumina paired-end sequencing (see Additional file 1: Table S1 for a summary) were de novo assembled, resulting in a total of 119 Mb operational scaffolds (scaffolds longer than 1 kb) with N50 of 19,859 bp. Most of the reads (87 %) were included in the assembly with the longest scaffolds being 640 kb (Additional file 1: Table S2).Metagenomic DNA extracted from sludge samples collected from the same thermophilic anaerobic cellulosedegrading reactor but at two different time points [the short-term enrichment at 120 days of enrichment (SE) and the long-term enrichment at 549 days (LE)] were deeply sequenced to construct the two differential coverage for genome reconstruction.

        <p>As shown in Fig. 1, the coverage binning produced six primary genome bins (named as TCF-2, 5, 8, 12, 13, and 14) showing closely clustered coverage in the SE and LE metagenomes. The accumulation of Chloroflexi during enrichment facilitated the retrieving of the related genome bins (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Then, tetranucleotide frequency (TNF) was used to filter out possible contamination at hierarchy distance of 0.1 [20]. The quality of these six primary Chloroflexi genome bins was then evaluated in terms of genome completeness and contamination, respectively based on the occupation and duplication of the 107 essential single-copy genes (ESCGs) shared &gt;95 % of all bacteria (Additional file 1: Tables S3,S4). Except for TCF-14, the other five genome bins showed comparable completeness and ESCG redundancy to that of the other finished genomes of Chloroflexi (completeness larger than 96 % with redundancy less than 5 %, Additional file 1: Table S5). This quality estimation was double checked by an alternative method based on 35 conserved single-copy COGs [21]. Consistent completeness and purity estimation results were observed for these five genome bins (Additional file 1: Table S6). The subsequent genome annotation was only based on these five high-quality genome bins. The other retrieved genomes can be found in Additional file 1: Table S7.As shown in Fig. 1, the coverage binning produced six primary genome bins (named as TCF-2, 5, 8, 12, 13, and 14) showing closely clustered coverage in the SE and LE metagenomes.

        <p>To solve the phylogenetic position of these five genome bins, firstly neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed with recovered 16S rRNA genes of the TCF-2, 5, 12, and 13 and high-quality 16S clone sequences downloaded from Silva SSU 15.0 database. As shown in Fig. 2, all of the curated genomes were placed within Anaerolineae class. TCF-2, TCF-5, and TCF-12 were clustered to the order of Anaerolinales and respectively affiliated with A. thermolimosa, Bellilinea caldifistulae, and Thermanaerothrix daxensis. In contrast, TCF-13 showed no confirmed affiliation to any known genus. The closest known relative of TCF-13 is Thermomarinilinea lacunofontalis at maximum-likelihood evolutionary distance larger than 0.1, suggesting that this species may belong to a novel lineage within Anaerolineae class. This lineage was named as the SHA-31 family of SBR1031 order in the updated greengenes taxonomy (published in May 2013) [22]. Since the 16S rRNA gene of TCF-8 is too short (only 65 bp) to make confident alignment, maximum-likehood tree based on the concatenated alignment of 35 single-copy ESCGs shared among the five genome bins and twenty-two finished genomes of Chloroflexi was used in addition to phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA genes. The concatenated clustering indicated close phylogenetic affiliation of TCF-8 to the SBR1031 lineage containing TCF-13 (Fig. 3). Further comparison based on the average nucleotide identity (ANI) also supported this affiliation that TCF-8 shared far more genes with TCF-13 (811 shared genes) than with any other genomes of the Anaerolineales lineage (Additional file 1: Figure S2b). TCF-8 and TCF-13 shall represent different species of this previously inaccessible lineage since ANI between these two genomes (79.3 %) was less than 94 % [23] and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization value (DDH of 17.7 %) much lower than 70 % [24] (Additional file 1: Figure S2a).To solve the phylogenetic position of these five genome bins, firstly neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed with recovered 16S rRNA genes of the TCF-2, 5, 12, and 13 and high-quality 16S clone sequences downloaded from Silva SSU 15.0 database.

        <p>Among the five curated genomes obtained, TCF-2, 5, and 12 showed average genome size of 3.5 Mb and GC content 54 % which is more consistent with that of A. thermophila UNI-1 (the only available complete genome of Anaerolineae), while TCF-8 and TCF-13 showed slightly bigger genome (&gt;4.0 Mb) with higher GC content (around 65 %) (Table 1). Resembling their phylogenetic affiliation (Figs. 2,3), complete-linkage clustering on COG orthologs also indicated that TCF-8 and TCF-13 were functionally divergent from the cluster containing TCF-2, 5, 12, and UNI-1 (Additional file 1: Figure S3). In both the SE and LE metagenome, the order of Anaerolinales containing TCF-2, 5, 12, and UNI-1 were generally more prevalent than SBR1031 order containing TCF-8 and TCF-13 (Fig. 1). TCF-2 taking 14.1 % of SE and 11.7 % of LE metagenome was one of the dominant populations within the TCF community. Despite of the large population size, TCF-2 expressed only comparatively small fraction (27.8 % of possible transcripts detected, Table 1) of its genetic complement in situ and this at a moderate level of expression suggesting the tight regulation of gene expression to facilitate preferential metabolism in TCF-2. The metabolic advantage of this population will be discussed from the major steps of anaerobic digestion process: fermentative metabolism, cellulose hydrolysis, and syntrophic methanogenesis.Among the five curated genomes obtained, TCF-2, 5, and 12 showed average genome size of 3.5 Mb and GC content 54 % which is more consistent with that of A. thermophila UNI-1 (the only available complete genome of Anaerolineae), while TCF-8 and TCF-13 showed slightly bigger genome (&gt;4.0 Mb) with higher GC content (around 65 %) (Table 1).

        <p>Anaerolineae showed versatile metabolic abilities on carbohydrate fermentation. Glycolysis pathway towards acetate and lactate production was conserved among TCF-2, 5, 12, and UNI-1 (Additional file 1: Figure S4) suggesting that acetate and lactate shall be produced during fermentation. TCF-8 and TCF-13 also processed the complete acetate pathway but not that for lactate generation. Additionally, common encoding-gene cluster of NiFe The relative abundance of each genome bin is estimated as the number of reads mapped to the draft genome in percentage of the total number of reads in the metagenome hydrogenase (COG3260, 3261, 3262) and related proteins in five curated genome bins and UNI-1 indicated the metabolic ability to produce hydrogen during fermentation, consistent with previous experimental results based on isolated strains [3][4][5][8][9][10][11].Anaerolineae showed versatile metabolic abilities on carbohydrate fermentation.

        <p>Except for TCF-8, active transcription of cellulase M and cellulases of GH05 and GH09 in the other four Anaerolineae genomes indicated their ecological roles as cellulose hydrolyzers in the cellulolytic community (Fig. 4). We speculated that the Anaerolineae populations might rely on extra-cellular cellulase systems for hydrolysis because no cohension, dockerin (key component of cellulosome complex), or any cellulase-related carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) could be identified in the five curated genomes and UNI-1. Nevertheless our previous study on the transcriptional characterization of this TCF consortium showed minimum contribution of the Chloroflexi, compared to Clostridiales and Bacteroidetes in overall cellulose hydrolysis [25]. Such transcriptional inefficiency may be regulatory that the cellulase M clusters of Anaerolineae were not protected by the preceding heat shock protein like that found in Clostridiales [25]. Consequently, cellulolytic capacity is unlikely the driven force for the prevalence of Anaerolineae within the community.Except for TCF-8, active transcription of cellulase M and cellulases of GH05 and GH09 in the other four Anaerolineae genomes indicated their ecological roles as cellulose hydrolyzers in the cellulolytic community (Fig. 4).

        <p>Based on metatranscriptomic data, strikingly high transcription of pilA gene (type IV pili assembly protein as designated K02651 and K02650 in KEGG database), the leading gene for the assembly of a conservative type IV pili (Tfp), was noticed in TCF-2, TCF-5, and TCF-12 (Fig. 5). Based on the assumption, genes encoding the beneficial physiochemical features shall be actively transcribed, deciphering the function of the vigorous transcribed Tfp assembly in Anaerolinales shall bring useful insight into the gradual dominance of this population within TCF community. The Tfp is the most widespread organs of bacterial attachment [26]. As has been already noted, pili are often involved in facilitating adhesion and colonization in a wide variety of scenarios including: host cells attachment in numerous human pathogens such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans [27]; cellulose binding in Ruminococcus albus [28] and biofilm formation on stainless steel in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [29]. Moreover, the Tfp in Geobacter sulfurreducens are electrical-conductive nanowires involving in direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between syntrophic patterns [30].Based on metatranscriptomic data, strikingly high transcription of pilA gene (type IV pili assembly protein as designated K02651 and K02650 in KEGG database), the leading gene for the assembly of a conservative type IV pili (Tfp), was noticed in TCF-2, TCF-5, and TCF-12 (Fig. 5).

        <p>As shown in Fig. 5, the conservative Tfp cluster observed in Anaerolinales contains a series of genes encoding pilus assembly proteins (pilA, CpaB, CpaE, CpaF) and two consecutive Tad proteins (TadB, TadC). The adhesive nature of the Tfp of Anaerolinales could be inferred from the occupation and expression of the Tad (tight adhesion) locus which is the essential machinery for the assembly of adhesive pili [31]. The precursor of the major structure component of Tfp is encoded by pilA gene. This precursor seems regulatory crucial for effectiveness of Tfp in Anaerolinales because the Tfp cluster without proceeding pilA genes in TCF-8 and TCF-13 showed (2) complete genomes in purple; (3) isolated strains are in green no transcriptional activities (Fig. 5). Given TCF-8 and 13′s comparable metabolic capacities to the dominating Anaerolineales, such ineffectiveness of Tfp cluster may play a role for their rareness in the community. Additionally, in contrast to the low expression level in carbohydrate metabolism, all the homolog copies of the pilA genes in TCF-2, TCF-5, and TCF-12 (respectively encoded 3, 2, and 2 genes annotated as homologs of this enzyme class) got expressed, suggesting the ecological benefits endorsed by pilA expression in Anaerolinales.As shown in Fig. 5, the conservative Tfp cluster observed in Anaerolinales contains a series of genes encoding pilus assembly proteins (pilA, CpaB, CpaE, CpaF) and two consecutive Tad proteins (TadB, TadC).

        <p>As community profiling based on HTS of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed, comparing to the evident accumulation of Clostridium and Fervidobacterium, populations of Anaerolinales (Anaerolineae and Bellilineae), though were among the most prevalent populations attached, stayed unchanged in size during the first 12 h of hydrolysis, suggesting its relative incompetence to grow on cellulose surface (Fig. 6). This observation was consistent with the reluctant expression of cellulase genes in the retrieved genomes bins of this lineage. Additionally, increasing bacterial diversity (Additional file 1: Figure S5) in the attached community was induced by the more degradable alpha-and beta-monosaccharides generated at the steady phase of hydrolysis (after 24 h, Figure S5). Remarkable increase of Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas was observed at this stage, but the paucity of Anaerolineae stayed unaffected. Although being commonly regarded as aerobic, strains of Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas had been reported to be tolerant to anaerobic environment [32][33][34][35]. The overgrowth of these two genera in the attached community after 24 h of incubation may be originated from a combination of their ability to utilize beta-linked monosaccharides released from the hydrolysis process [36] as well as their extraordinary ability to grow in biofilm [37,38]. These results indicated the accumulation of Anaerolinales took place other than directly on the surface of cellulose, therefore, we speculate, instead of initiating the attachment on substrate surface, the adhesive feature of Anaerolineae enabled by active pilA expression might serve as the adhesive matrix for the aggregation of fermentative population in the liquid phase. Since, most anaerobic cellulolytic microorganisms grow optimally on cellulose when attached to the substrate and in at least a few species this adhesion appears to be obligate [36], this surface-free life style of Anaerolinales reflected its incompetence in cellulose hydrolysis as disclosed by metatranscriptome. The continuous stirring provided in the enrichment SBR may play the selective role for Anaerolinales that microorganisms capable of attaching to each other would benefit from a more efficient exchange of fermentation intermediates and thus proliferate more effectively in competition with other free-ranging anaerobic fermentative counterparts [39]. The advantageous bonding capacity in Anaerolinales observed in this study may provide a novel insight into its ubiquity and accumulation in anaerobic digestive systems.As community profiling based on HTS of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed, comparing to the evident accumulation of Clostridium and Fervidobacterium, populations of Anaerolinales (Anaerolineae and Bellilineae), though were among the most prevalent populations attached, stayed unchanged in size during the first 12 h of hydrolysis, suggesting its relative incompetence to grow on cellulose surface (Fig. 6).

        <p>Another interesting function of Tfp is its conductive role for syntrophic DIET. Since the Anaerolineae lineage of Chloroflexi was considered as semi-syntrophic in anaerobic systems [1] and its interspecies electron transfer (IET) mechanism in mutualistic cooperation with methanogens was yet to be studied, study on the syntrophic machinery and DIET involvement of Anaerolineae is indispensable. Despite the lack of detected transcriptional activities, the shared 926 genes between TCF-8 and TCF-13 (Additional file 1: Figure S2b) revealed a genetic potential of these populations to metabolize ethanol to acetate (Additional file 1: Figure S4), implying their putative role as anaerobic syntrophs. However, these pathways were absent from Anaerolinales containing TCF-2, 5, 12, and UNI-1. Additionally, by comparing the transcriptional activities of genes involved in the fundamental steps of syntrophic metabolism as proposed by Sieber et al. [40], relatively weak activities of hydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase suggested the unsteady involvement of H 2 or formate as the electron carrier for IET in Anaerolineae populations (Table 2). Researchers believed genomic co-occurrence of pilA and outer membrane cytochromes was prerequisite for DIET to take place in a microbe [41]. Despite the active pilA, none of the five curated genome bins and UNI-1 possesses c-type cytochromes (Table 2). As a result, we cannot confirm nor exclude the DIET potential based on the paradox between highly active pilA gene and absence of membrane cytochromes in TCF-2, 5, and 12. As a result, consecutive iron supplementation batch tests were designed to verify the DIET potential of the TCF community based on the hypothesis that electricbased syntrophic methanogenesis could be expedited by the dosage of conductive iron-oxide minerals [42]. Fe 2 O 3 powder was dosed at 20 mM of iron atom [42] to stimulate the electron exchange within the TCF community in three consecutive batches. But batches with iron-oxide supplementation showed no evident advancement on the overall methanogenesis in the short-(1st batch) and long-term (3rd batch) run (Additional file 1: Figure S6a). These batch results indicated that the possibility of DIET phenomenon among microbial populations within the TCF community was rare and thus rejected the initial speculation on DIET involvement of the highly active Tfp in TCF-2, 5, and 12.Another interesting function of Tfp is its conductive role for syntrophic DIET.

Despite the slight transcription of cellulolytic genes, the prevalence of this population should more likely interrelate with the evident cellular adhesiveness enabled by active transcription of Tfp. Further experiment showed this Tfp structure was functioned as adhesive matrix for cell-cell aggregation other than cell-surface attachment for biofilm initiation nor electron transfer for syntrophic methanogenesis.Coverage-based genome recovery coupled with metatranscriptomic interpretation was used to disclose the advantageous features of Anaerolineae populations in anaerobic digestive system based on the five nearcomplete genomes retrieved from the TCF community.

        <p>Two metagenomic libraries were constructed with genomic DNA respectively extracted from the SE and LE sludge samples. Genomic DNA was extracted from 500 mg dry weight sludge sample with FastDNA ® SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Illkirch, France). Sequencing of the metagenomic DNA was carried out on the Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform at BGI (Shenzhen, China) by applying the 101 bp paired-end strategy with combined insert lengths of 180 and 800 bp for SE metagenome and sole 180 bp insert for LE metagenome (Additional file 1: Table S2). The resulted PE reads were trimmed for sequencing adaptors before filtering out reads with average phred quality score lower than 20 and ambiguous nucleotide using PRINSEQ [43]. The shotgun metagenomic reads have been deposited into the 
            <rs type="software">MG-RAST</rs> server for data sharing (see Table S1 for the accession number). SE and LE metagenomes and LE metatranscriptome have been used in our previous studies with focus other than Anaerolineae populations [25,44].

            <rs type="version">6.0.2</rs> (
            <rs type="creator">CLCbio</rs>, Denmark), were compared in terms of reads utilization efficiency and length of scaffolds (Additional file 1: Table S9). The most comprehensive IDBA_UD were picked to assemble the SE and LE metagenomes together using a series of kmer 20,40,60,80, and 100. Two metagenomes were assembled together to facilitate generation of long scaffolds. Only scaffolds longer than 1 kb were kept for subsequent genomic binning analysis.

        <p>Based on the assumption that scaffolds belonging to the same genome (strain) should share similar coverage across different metagenomes, scaffolds of targeted Anaerolineae genome bins were recruited from the twodimensional coverage plot using R 
            <rs type="software">scripts</rs> [13]. Divergent coverage of Chloroflexi populations were provided by metagenomic libraries of thermophilic cellulolytic sludge sampled from the same reactor but at two different times (SE at 120 days and LE at 545 days). The coverage sets of scaffolds were obtained by independently mapping PE reads in the SE and LE metagenomes against scaffolds assembled, using 
            <rs type="software">Bowtie</rs>
            <rs type="version">1.0.1</rs> [47] allowing two mismatches over the entire read length (bowtie option: -v 2 -m 200) [20]. Coverage of a scaffold was calculated as the total base pairs of mapped read divided by its length. After that, the scaffolds were binned based on the clustering of coverage and phylum assignment. To minimize the potential contamination, another genomic signature, tetra-nucleotide frequency (TNF), was used to refine the bins at euclidean distance cutoff of 0.1 [20]. Finally, PEtracking tools from the 
            <rs type="software">mm genome package</rs> [13] was used to reinforce the scaffolding by retrieving genes initially excluded, for example, genes showing deviate coverage caused by multiple copies.
