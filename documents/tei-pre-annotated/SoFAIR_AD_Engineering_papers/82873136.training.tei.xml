        <p>Methane (CH 4 ) is produced as an end product from feed fermentation in the rumen. Yield of CH 4 varies between individuals despite identical feeding conditions. To get a better understanding of factors behind the individual variation, 73 dairy cows given the same feed but differing in CH 4 emissions were investigated with focus on fiber digestion, fermentation end products and bacterial and archaeal composition. In total 21 cows (12 Holstein, 9 Swedish Red) identified as persistent low, medium or high CH 4 emitters over a 3 month period were furthermore chosen for analysis of microbial community structure in rumen fluid. This was assessed by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene and by quantitative qPCR of targeted Methanobrevibacter groups. The results showed a positive correlation between low CH 4 emitters and higher abundance of Methanobrevibacter ruminantium clade. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) on operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level of bacteria showed two distinct clusters (P &lt; 0.01) that were related to CH 4 production. One cluster was associated with low CH 4 production (referred to as cluster L) whereas the other cluster was associated with high CH 4 production (cluster H) and the medium emitters occurred in both clusters. The differences between clusters were primarily linked to differential abundances of certain OTUs belonging to Prevotella. Moreover, several OTUs belonging to the family Succinivibrionaceae were dominant in samples belonging to cluster L. Fermentation pattern of volatile fatty acids showed that proportion of propionate was higher in cluster L, while proportion of butyrate was higher in cluster H. No difference was found in milk production or organic matter digestibility between cows. Cows in cluster L had lower CH 4 /kg energy corrected milk (ECM) compared to cows in cluster H, 8.3 compared to 9.7 g CH 4 /kg ECM, showing that low CH 4 cows utilized the feed more efficient for milk production which might indicate a more efficient microbial population or host genetic differences that is reflected in bacterial and archaeal (or methanogens) populations.Methane (CH 4 ) is produced as an end product from feed fermentation in the rumen.

        <p>Ruminants are unique in their ability to utilize feeds rich in cellulose, most likely due to the great diversity of microorganisms that break down feed in the rumen of the host animal. Microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and protozoa break down complex compounds by hydrolysis to produce volatile fatty acids (VFA), mainly acetate, propionate and butyrate. At the same time, varying amounts of formic acid, hydrogen (H 2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) are produced as end products in fermentation (Hook et al., 2010). Most of the methanogenic archaea in the rumen use H 2 to reduce CO 2 to produce methane (CH 4 ). This process keeps the partial pressure of H 2 low, which directs fermentation toward production of less reduced end products including acetate (Moss et al., 2000). Some methanogens in the rumen can also use other substrates for methanogenesis, such as methyl-containing compounds (Hungate, 1967;Liu and Whitman, 2008). The CH 4 produced is not used by the animal itself, but instead represents an energy loss (2-12% of gross energy) to the atmosphere, mainly by eructation, where it has a negative impact on the climate (Johnson and Johnson, 1995). Therefore, various mitigation strategies have been evaluated with the aim of reducing CH 4 emissions, including for example using different feed and feedstuffs high in lipids, ionophores, plant compounds such as tannins and enzymes (Beauchemin et al., 2009;Hook et al., 2010;Cieslak et al., 2013). These strategies have produced varying results, but with no significant longterm effect. However, recently, the use of 3-nitrooxypropanol, a compound designed to inhibit the activity of the enzyme responsible for formation of CH 4 (Duval and Kindermann, 2012), was shown to reduce CH 4 emissions in dairy cows without any signs of toxic effects on the animal and no or a minor effect on DMI (Reynolds et al., 2014;Hristov et al., 2015;Lopes et al., 2016).Ruminants are unique in their ability to utilize feeds rich in cellulose, most likely due to the great diversity of microorganisms that break down feed in the rumen of the host animal.

        <p>Previous studies have shown a natural variation between individual animals, producing different yields of CH 4 even for the same feeding conditions (Danielsson et al., 2012;Pinares-Patiño et al., 2013). Studies where CH 4 has been measured, with both tracer gas and respiration chambers, suggest that there is a repeatable and heritable variation between individuals and thus genetic selection for lower CH 4 production could be possible (Heimeier, 2010;Pinares-Patiño et al., 2013). However, in order to use genetic selection, it is important to know which factors are important for variation in CH 4 production and whether these are heritable without negatively affecting productivity. The mechanism causing high/low CH 4 production in cows is still unclear, but one possible explanation is differences in passage rate due to differences in rumen size (Goopy et al., 2014). Feed is less degraded in a smaller rumen compared with a larger rumen, thus yielding less H 2 for CH 4 formation (Goopy et al., 2014). Another source of variation may be linked to differences in community structure of the microbiota in the rumen, a parameter possibly also linked to the difference in passage time.Previous studies have shown a natural variation between individual animals, producing different yields of CH 4 even for the same feeding conditions (Danielsson et al., 2012;Pinares-Patiño et al., 2013).

        <p>In the cow rumen, Methanobrevibacter seems to be the dominant genus of the archaeal domain (Leahy et al., 2013;Henderson et al., 2015). In our earlier studies, certain groups of Methanobrevibacter species (M. smithii, M. gottschalkii, M. millerae, and M. thaueri), known as the SGMT group (King et al., 2011), were correlated to individuals with higher CH 4 production but also to feed additive, indicating that specific substrates favor certain Methanobrevibacter species (Danielsson et al., 2012(Danielsson et al., , 2014)). In a study by Kittelmann et al. (2014), two different types of bacterial communities were linked with low CH 4 production in sheep.In the cow rumen, Methanobrevibacter seems to be the dominant genus of the archaeal domain (Leahy et al., 2013;Henderson et al., 2015).

        <p>Due to new molecular techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, knowledge of rumen microbiology has increased in recent years, but the correlation to level of CH 4 emissions is still not clear. Moreover, it is unclear whether cows producing comparatively lower amounts of CH 4 have less efficient feed degradation, resulting in lower milk and meat production. To address this question we studied cows, given the same feed, with regard to CH 4 formation, fiber digestibility, milk production and archaeal-and bacterial community structure. The hypothesis was that cows with similar digestibility and milk production can produce different amounts of CH 4 . These differences are related to individual archaeal-and bacterial community structures in the rumen. The bacterial and archaeal composition in individuals identified as low and high CH 4 emitters was analyzed by sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons using the Illumina MiSeq platform, and quantitative real-time PCR for accurate monitoring of selected taxa.Due to new molecular techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, knowledge of rumen microbiology has increased in recent years, but the correlation to level of CH 4 emissions is still not clear.

        <p>The study was performed at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Swedish Livestock Research Center, Lövsta, Uppsala. The experiment was approved by the Uppsala Local Ethics Committee C/124/12. In total, 73 dairy cows (39 Swedish Red (SRB) and 34 Holsteins) in mid-lactation were included in the study. Approximately 45% of the cows were primiparous and 55% were multiparous. Each cow was included in the study from 90 to 180 days post parturition, a period when cows have normally stabilized at high feed intake and milk production. Sampling was performed at three occasions over mid-lactation [days in milk (DIM) ± standard deviation]; the first 133 ± 18 DIM, the second 175 ± 11 DIM, and the third 190 ± 9 DIM.The study was performed at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Swedish Livestock Research Center, Lövsta, Uppsala.

        <p>The cows were housed in a free-stall barn with an automatic milking system (DeLaval VMS TM ; DeLaval, Tumba, Sweden). The cows were equipped with neck transponders and had access to separate concentrate blends in two feeding stations for concentrate (DeLaval, Tumba, Sweden) and concentrate was also fed in the milking station. One kilogram of concentrate was accessible each time the cow went for milking in the robot, while the rest of the daily offered concentrate was provided in the concentrate feeding stations. Concentrate was given in pulse doses related to time the cow was in the feeding station, but with a maximum amount of 2 kg at each visit to get total daily amount of concentrate in evenly spread intervals during 24 h. Silage was fed in 20 forage mangers placed on weighing cells, all mangers was available for all cows at all hours. The forage intake was measured by calculating the difference in weight of the manger from when the cow was entering the manger and the weight when the cow was leaving the manger (BioControl, Rakkestad, Norway). Feeding level was based on calculations of the individual nutrient requirements of each cow according to NorFor standards for dairy cows (Volden, 2011). Silage and concentrate were fed separately to all cows throughout the period. The silage was grassdominated (timothy, fescue, perennial ryegrass) with a small proportion of red clover (&lt;20%), silage chopping length were set to 20 mm.

        <p>Spot samples of feces, about 0.5 L, were collected twice daily (around 8 a.m. and 15 p.m.) on four consecutive days during the measurement periods, frozen and stored at -20 • C. The samples were thawed and pooled into one sample per period and cow before analysis. The samples were then freeze-dried, milled and analyzed for DM, ash, NDF, crude protein and acid insoluble ash (AIA). From the total intake of acid insoluble ash and the fecal content of AIA the total amount of feces was calculated (Van Keulen and Young, 1977). Apparent organic matter (OM) digestibility was calculated from estimated intake of organic matter and estimated OM excreted in feces: (OMfeed-OMfaeces)/OMfeed. Apparent digestibility of NDF assayed with a heat-stable amylase and expressed exclusive of residual ash and crude protein was calculated in a similar way.Spot samples of feces, about 0.5 L, were collected twice daily (around 8 a.m. and 15 p.m.) on four consecutive days during the measurement periods, frozen and stored at -20 • C.

        <p>The cows were milked in the automatic milking system and yield was recorded on a daily basis as kg milk/day. Samples (∼20 mL) for analysis of milk composition were obtained morning and evening on two consecutive days at the beginning of each measurement period and stored at +4 • C in a refrigerator. Analyses of fat, protein and lactose concentrations in milk were performed by infrared spectroscopy (MilkoScanTM FT120,Foss,Hillerød,Denmark). The analytical values for the separate milking's were weighted according to yield at each milking to a representative sample.

        <p>Methane was measured by the method described by Garnsworthy et al. (2012). In brief, CH 4 concentrations were measured during milking using an infrared CH 4 analyzer (Guardian Plus; Edinburgh Instruments Ltd., Livingston, UK). The analyzer was calibrated by the use of standard mixtures of CH 4 in nitrogen. Air was drawn continuously through a polyethylene tube (6 mm inner diameter) at 1 L/min through the instrument by an integral pump between the gas inlet port and the analyzer. The sampling tube was attached on the concentrate trough in the milking robot and the tube were checked daily for blockages. CH 4 concentration was logged every second on data logger (Simex SRD-99; Simex Sp. z o.o., Gdansk, Poland) and then visualized using logging software (
            <rs type="creator">Loggy Soft</rs>; 
            <rs type="creator">Simex</rs> Sp. z o.o.). Times of entry to milking station and cow ID were recognized using the 
            <rs type="software">VMS</rs> management program (
            <rs type="creator">DelPro</rs> software, version 
            <rs type="version">3.7</rs>; 
            <rs type="creator">DeLaval International</rs> AB). Peaks were identified and quantified; raw data from the logger were transformed into values for peak height (maximum minus baseline CH 4 concentration for each eructation) and integral of peak area (representing total CH 4 release per eructation). Peaks with a height of less than 200 mg/kg above baseline were discarded. For each milking, mean peak height and integral were calculated, together with peak frequency (eructation rate). Milking occasion with fewer than three recorded peaks were removed from analysis. An index of CH 4 emission during each milking was calculated as the product of peak frequency and mean peak area. To take into account the dilution of eructed air by the ambient air a factor of dilution was determined and CH 4 concentrations was adjusted with a dilution factor. A volume of 2.2 L of 1.0% CH 4 in nitrogen was released into the feed bin. Methane were released at two sites of the trough, at the base and at the center in level with the sampling tube. CH 4 release was replicated 5 times at each release site and then a mean ratio of CH 4 concentrations in released and sampled gases was used to convert CH 4 index to CH 4 emission rate during milking. CH 4 was measured throughout the study. To get values for each sampling period, CH 4 measurement on a 14d basis around the measuring period was used to get an average value for the period.

        <p>16S rRNA amplicon libraries were constructed as triplicates with a two-step PCR. The first PCR simultaneously targeted the V4 region of both bacteria and archaea, using the primers 515 ′ F (GTGBCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 805R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) (Hugerth et al., 2014). The reaction mixtures were set up using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA). The reaction mixture contained 5 µL Phusion buffer, 0.5 µL (10 mM) dNTP, 0.75 µL DMSO and 0.25 µL (2 U/µL) Phusion polymerase. The first PCR reaction contained 0.5 µL (10 µM) of each primer, Phusion mix and DNA template. Amplification was performed under the following conditions: initial denaturing step at 98 • C for 30 s, 20 cycles of: 10 s at 98 • C, 30 s at 60 • C, 4 s at 72 • C, and a final extension at 72 • C for 2 min. The PCR products were checked for size and quality by electrophoresis. Samples were then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Becker Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), using a magnetic particle/DNA volume ratio of 0.8:1. The second PCR reaction contained 10 µL purified DNA product, Phusion reaction mix and 1 µL each of the primers 5 ′ -AATGATACGGCGACCACCAGATCTACACX 8 ACACTC TTTCCCTACACGACG-3 and 5 ′ -CAAGCAGAAGACGGCA TACGAGATX 8 GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTT CCGATCT-3 ′ , where X 8 in the primer sequence represented a specific Illumina-compatible barcode. Detailed information about these primers can be found in Hugerth et al. (2014). The barcodes (Eurofins Genomics) were combined, giving a unique combination of barcodes for each sample and thereby allowing for multiplex analysis in the sequencing. The following conditions were used for the second PCR step: initial denaturing at 98 • C for 30 s, 8 cycles of 10 s at 98 • C, 30 s at 62 • C, 5 s at 72 • C, and a final extension at 72 • C for 2 min. The PCR products were checked by electrophoresis and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP. Each sample was then diluted to the same DNA concentration of 20 nM and pooled to one sample library. The pooled library was sequenced on the MiSeq system (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, Ca, USA) at Science for Life Laboratory/NGI (Solna, Sweden).16S rRNA amplicon libraries were constructed as triplicates with a two-step PCR. The first PCR simultaneously targeted the V4 region of both bacteria and archaea, using the primers 515 ′ F (GTGBCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 805R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) (Hugerth et al., 2014). The reaction mixtures were set up using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA). The reaction mixture contained 5 µL Phusion buffer, 0.5 µL (10 mM) dNTP, 0.75 µL DMSO and 0.25 µL (2 U/µL) Phusion polymerase. The first PCR reaction contained 0.5 µL (10 µM) of each primer, Phusion mix and DNA template. Amplification was performed under the following conditions: initial denaturing step at 98 • C for 30 s, 20 cycles of: 10 s at 98 • C, 30 s at 60 • C, 4 s at 72 • C, and a final extension at 72 • C for 2 min.

        <p>Sequence analysis was performed as described in Müller et al. (2016). In brief, sequences were quality trimmed and trimmed pair end reads were further processed using the 
            <rs type="software">QIIME</rs> software package, version 
            <rs type="version">1.8</rs> (Caporaso et al., 2010). Sequence data were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) sharing 97% sequence similarity using an open reference OTU picking strategy. The most abundant sequence in each OTU was selected as representative sequences and further aligned against the Greengenes core set using 
            <rs type="software">PyNAST</rs> software (Caporaso et al., 2010). Taxonomy was assigned to each OTU using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier with a minimum confidence threshold of 80% (Wang et al., 2007). The chimeric sequences were removed by 
            <rs type="software">ChimeraSlayer</rs> (Haas et al., 2011) and the final OTU table was filtered based on the criteria that the OTU had to be observed in the three replicates to be retained and that one OTU had to contain 57 reads (0.001% of total reads) to be retained. The OTU tables were subsampled (according to the sample containing the smallest set of sequences) to equalize sampling depth. Archaeal sequences were separated from the total sequence set and also assigned using RIM-DB version 13_11_13 (Seedorf et al., 2014), giving more detailed taxonomic information. For further univariate analysis of bacteria, a threshold level at OTUs containing more than 5786 reads (0.1% of total reads) was used. One period for one cow was removed in QIIME because of comparatively fewer reads content in all three replicates (only 0.05% of total reads compared with the other samples). Raw reads have been deposited in SRA at NCBI under accession number PRJNA339907.

            <rs type="software">SAS</rs> was used to identify possible relationships between bacterial clusters, different physiological, dietary and production parameters, VFAs and their relationship to the relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter clades (M. ruminantium and M. gottschalkii) and absolute numbers of Methanobrevibacter SGMT and Methanobrevibacter. RO (Table 5). This analysis showed that the differences between the clusters were primarily related to: CH 4 production (g/day), gCH 4 /kg ECM, but also the proportions of VFAs, with a relatively higher proportion of propionate in cluster L (19.6%) compared with cluster H (17.1%) (P &lt; 0.001). In addition, the proportion of butyrate differed between cluster L (14.7%) and cluster H (17.3%). Differences were also observed for acetate (A) + butyrate (B)/propionate (P) ratio, with a higher ratio in cluster H. The relation to different Methanobrevibacter species with different clusters was clear, and similar to differences as those between CH 4 groups, the difference was related to an increase of Methanobrevibacter RO in cluster L compared to cluster H, 2.11 × 10 7 compared to 6.48 × 10 6 number of copies/mL, respectively. However, there were no difference in levels of Methanobrevibacter SGMT between clusters. Neither were there any differences found in milk production, feed intake or digestibility. Effect of breed within cluster was observed for lactation number, weight, and condition score. Methane production per kilo ECM, lactose, propionate and A+B/P was significant between breeds but with no interaction on cluster (Table 5).

        <p>Based on measurements of CH 4 production from the 73 cows included in this study, it was possible to identify cows that were persistent low and high CH 4 emitters over a period of 3 months. The method chosen for measurement of CH 4 production gave lower CH 4 values than expected, although relative differences between high and low CH 4 emitters were significant. Analysis of the archaeal and bacterial communities from 6 high, 8 medium, and 7 low CH 4 emitters revealed that there was a correlation between CH 4 group and community structure for both the archaea and bacteria.Based on measurements of CH 4 production from the 73 cows included in this study, it was possible to identify cows that were persistent low and high CH 4 emitters over a period of 3 months.

        <p>In line with previous studies, no significant difference was seen between the different groups of cows and total abundance of archaea. The main conclusion drawn in previous publications has been that the number of archaea is not essential for the level of CH 4 production, but rather the metabolic activity of individual methanogenic species is important (Shi et al., 2014). However, in contrast to these results, Wallace et al. (2014Wallace et al. ( , 2015) ) found a correlation between production of CH 4 and amount of archaea, based on 16S rRNA gene analysis using qPCR. These authors argue that methanogenesis is the only mechanism of ATP synthesis and therefore it should be a relationship between methane production and methanogens' numbers. The main difference in the present study was found at species level, where the relative abundance of M. gottschalkii clade was linked with higher CH 4 production, and relative abundance of M. ruminantium was related to low CH 4 production. This agrees with our previous finding of an association between the two groups of Methanobrevibacter species and CH 4 production in Swedish dairy cows (Danielsson et al., 2012). A similar linkage between relative abundance of M. gottschalkii and high CH 4 production was found in a study by Shi et al. (2014) investigating the microbiota of sheep. In the present study, specific groups of Methanobrevibacter (RO and SGMT) were targeted also by qPCR and the result showed no difference in copy numbers of Methanobrevibacter SGMT group between animals with high and low CH 4 production. Thus, it is likely that the observed difference in relative abundance between animals with high and low CH 4 production is linked to M. ruminantium. In a study by Kittelmann et al. (2013), the relative abundances of the two clades of M. gottschalkii and M. ruminantium were compared and shown to have a negative relationship (R 2 = 0.51). This means that when the relative abundance of one of the clades was high, that of the other clade was low. A possible explanation for this could be competition for the same substrate, as Methanobrevibacter species all are hydrogenotrophs (Leahy et al., 2013) and use hydrogen and/or formate as substrate for their CH 4 production. Another difference between M. gottschalkii and M. ruminantium is the presence of genes encoding the key methanogenic enzyme methyl-CoM reductase (Mcr). This enzyme is present in two isomeric forms, McrI and McrII, with the former usually expressed at low H 2 concentrations and the latter at high H 2 concentrations (Reeve et al., 1997). M.ruminantium M1 does not code for McrII, only for McrI (Leahy et al., 2010), and is thus most likely unable to scavenge hydrogen at higher concentrations. Therefore, different methanogenic species could have an advantage at different H 2 concentrations and/or respond differently to availability of different CH 4 substrates (Kittelmann et al., 2014). This study showed two different bacterial clusters in high and low emitting cows and these may have different fermentation patterns, resulting in different amounts of methanogenic substrates, including formate/H 2 , and consequently shaping the methanogenic community.In line with previous studies, no significant difference was seen between the different groups of cows and total abundance of archaea.

        <p>Indeed Kittelmann et al. (2013) showed that the two different clades seem to have co-occurrence with different species of bacteria, with M. gottschalkii clade co-occurring with bacteria from the family Ruminococcaceae and M. ruminantium clade linked with bacteria from the family Fibrobacteraceae. Both kinds of bacteria degrade cellulose in the rumen (Kobayashi et al., 2008), but Ruminococcus spp. produce large amounts of H 2 , while the two known Fibrobacter spp. only produce formate (Rychlik and May, 2000). This co-occurrence seems reasonable as studies on strains of M. ruminantium show CH 4 production from H 2 together with CO 2 and from formate (Smith and Hungate, 1958;Leahy et al., 2010), while M. gottschalkii grows and produces CH 4 on H 2 plus CO 2 , but do not use formate (Miller and Lin, 2002).Indeed Kittelmann et al.

        <p>In contrary to the study by Kittelmann et al. (2013), present study showed a higher relative abundance of Fibrobacter spp. in cluster H compared to cluster L, i.e., in the cows having a comparably higher abundance of the M. gottschalkii clade. In other study, Kittelmann et al. (2014) identified three different ruminotypes based on the ruminal community structure. Two ruminotypes were associated to low CH 4 production and one to high CH 4 production. In these ruminotypes, Fibrobacter succinogenes was present at a higher relative abundance in only one of the two low CH 4 ruminotypes as compared to the high CH 4 ruminotype. Possibly this differences in results are related to other differences in the ruminal microbial community structure but still it is apparent that the relationship between the methanogenic and bacterial community structure needs further investigations.In contrary to the study by Kittelmann et al.

        <p>Bacteria in Relation to Cows Producing Low and High Emissions of CH 4Bacteria in Relation to Cows Producing Low and High Emissions of CH 4</p>
        <p>Proteobacteria were present at higher abundance in the CH 4 low emitters compared with the high CH 4 emitters and were mainly represented by members of the family Succinivibrionaceae. Members of this family produce succinate, an intermediate product in propionate production. Propionate formation is not associated with any hydrogen production, which may explain the comparatively lower CH 4 production. The correlation between low CH 4 emitters and Succinivibrionaceae abundance was recently observed for the first time in the cow rumen by Wallace et al. (2015). Members of the Succinivibrionaceae have also been found in wallabies and are suggested to explain their lower CH 4 production per unit digestible energy intake, which is just 20% of that in cows (Pope et al., 2011). Analysis of the bacterial community structure revealed two separate clusters that coincided with the low and high CH 4 emitting groups. In accordance to our findings Kamke et al. (2016) found similar clustering in bacterial community composition in sheep which also was related to high, low and intermediate methane yield emitters. To find an explanation for the apparent difference in clustering and its possible connection to the CH 4 emission in this study the bacterial composition between these clusters were examined more in detail. This analysis showed that the difference between the clusters was linked to several OTUs that differed in abundance between the two clusters. One of the most prominent differences was related to members of the family Succinivibrionaceae, for which the relative abundance was 5-fold higher in cluster L than cluster H, related to lower CH 4 production. Actinobacteria in cluster H was represented by OTUs belonging to the families Bifidobacteriaceae and Coriobacteriaceae. Bifidobacterium produces lactic and acetic acid. Production of acetic acid instead of more reduced fermentation products is typically associated with increased hydrogen production (Moss et al., 2000), potentially increasing CH 4 production. Several OTUs that differed in relative abundance between clusters were classified to Prevotella, which is usually the main bacterial genus represented in the cow rumen, with many different species observed (Bekele et al., 2010;Kim et al., 2011). Comparison at genus level of Prevotella did not reveal any differences between clusters L and H, or between groups of high or low CH 4 emitters. There were however a difference between clusters at OTU level, i.e., several OTUs of Prevotella spp. had a higher abundance in cluster L compared to cluster H and several other OTUs had higher relative abundance in cluster H than cluster L. Prevotella spp. produce a variety of extracellular degradative enzymes, which degrade starch and hemicellulose in plant cell walls and also have proteolytic activity, although this varies greatly between Prevotella species (Stevenson and Weimer, 2007). Furthermore, it is known to be a great variation in the ability of different Prevotella species to utilize certain substrates, a nutritional adaptation that confers an advantage in the rumen environment with different components available through carbohydrate and protein feeds given to the cow (Avguštin et al., 1997;Stevenson and Weimer, 2007). On the other hand, this versatility of substrates makes the role of the Prevotella even harder to understand. The potential role of Prevotella is difficult to determine in any case, as a large proportion of the population is represented by uncultured species (Bekele et al., 2010). Therefore, we stress the importance of identifying more Prevotella spp., in order to understand the functional role of key bacteria in the rumen.Proteobacteria were present at higher abundance in the CH 4 low emitters compared with the high CH 4 emitters and were mainly represented by members of the family Succinivibrionaceae.

        <p>Differences in fermentation products such as proportions of butyrate (B) and propionate (P) in relation to total amounts of VFAs were detected. With cluster analysis, no difference was observed for acetate (A) but the ratio A+B/P differed between clusters L and H, indicating that the dominant fermentation pathway differs between bacteria within these two clusters. As mentioned above, formation of acetate and butyrate results in production of additional methanogenic substrates (formate and H 2 ), which may explain the increased amount of CH 4 production in cluster H. Fermentation leading to propionate formation results in less hydrogen being available for CH 4 production (Moss et al., 2000), which might explain the lower amount of CH 4 emitted by the cows in cluster L. Similarly, Kittelmann et al. (2014) assumed that proportionally more propionate was present in one of the low CH 4 emitting ruminotypes in that study.Differences in fermentation products such as proportions of butyrate (B) and propionate (P) in relation to total amounts of VFAs were detected.

        <p>Since the mechanism causing high and low CH 4 emitting cows is unclear, it is important not only to investigate the microbiome but also to examine effects on feed digestion and animal production parameters. Lower CH 4 production might be related to reduced fiber digestibility, thus also influencing the energy input to the animal. In this study no differences were observed in feed digestibility or milk production in any of the CH 4 emitting groups. This result was though in contradiction to the study by Pinares-Patiño et al. (2003) where a positive correlation was found between digestion of cellulose and CH 4 production. In the study by Pinares-Patiño et al. (2003) digestibility was measured by total collection. Choice of method might have an influence on digestibility values, for instance there seem to be a risk of overestimation of digestibility using AIA as internal marker compared to total collection (Lee and Hristov, 2013). Anyhow that risk would be the same for all cows within this study. Furthermore, mean standard deviation for apparent organic matter digestibility was 23 g/kg (average apparent organic matter digestibility value was 706 g/kg, CV = 3.2%) which is close to the 20 g/kg suggested by Van Soest (1994) as being the standard deviation of digestibility determination in carefully conducted experiments. AIA has also shown to provide reliable digestibility estimates in cattle fed grass silage-or hay-based diets (Huhtanen et al., 1994).Since the mechanism causing high and low CH 4 emitting cows is unclear, it is important not only to investigate the microbiome but also to examine effects on feed digestion and animal production parameters.

        <p>In studies on sheep a correlation has been found between CH 4 production and passage rate of feed particles, amount of liquid and rumen volume, but not with apparent DM digestibility (Goopy et al., 2014). Those authors suggested that no relationship between CH 4 and digestibility can be found, as the reduced utilization in the rumen is compensated for by increased postruminal digestion. This might explain why no differences are observed in whole tract feed digestion, even though there might be differences in microbial populations in the rumen causing differences in digestibility. On the other hand, feed efficiency studies have shown differences in microbial structure between animals in which feed utilization for production of meat or milk also differed (Guan et al., 2008;Zhou et al., 2009;Shabat et al., 2016). In the study by Guan et al. (2008), microbial community profiles from feed-efficient steers were clustered together and differed from those in inefficient steers, showing that the different microbial community related to lowered feed efficiency in rumen was not totally compensated with higher post ruminal digestion. In the recent study by Shabat et al. (2016) feed efficient cows had lower richness in both microbiome-and gene content compared to less feed efficient cows. It was also found that it was possible to predict the animals' feed efficiency phenotype by microbiome genes and species. Propionate to acetate ratio was also higher in efficient animals (Shabat et al., 2016), which strengthen the results of the relationship between microbial community structure and energy available for the cow. Analysis of the different clusters in this study showed a lower CH 4 /kg energy corrected milk (ECM) for cows in cluster L compared to cows in cluster H, 8.3 compared to 9.7 g CH 4 /kg ECM. This results shows that low CH 4 cows utilized the feed more efficient for milk production which might indicate a more efficient microbial population or some host genetic differences that have an impact on the microbial community structure.In studies on sheep a correlation has been found between CH 4 production and passage rate of feed particles, amount of liquid and rumen volume, but not with apparent DM digestibility (Goopy et al., 2014).

        <p>The majority of the investigated cows were consistently low or high CH 4 emitters over the studied period, 3 months, but no effect were seen on fiber digestion or milk production. The cows were grouped into two different clusters that differed in abundance of the Methanobrevibacter clades M. ruminantium and M. gottschalkii. Higher relative abundance of M. ruminantium and also copy numbers of the targeted group Methanobrevibacter RO were associated with the low CH 4 emitting group. The bacterial communities also differed between high and low emitting cows, possibly the reason for varying methanogen communities. Furthermore, the results from this study suggest that differences in the microbiota among individuals is linked with difference in the degree of CH 4 production.The majority of the investigated cows were consistently low or high CH 4 emitters over the studied period, 3 months, but no effect were seen on fiber digestion or milk production.
