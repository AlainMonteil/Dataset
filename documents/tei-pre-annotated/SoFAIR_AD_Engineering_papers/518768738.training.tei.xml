        <p>At the beginning of the artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) era, the expectations are high, and experts foresee that AI/ ML shows potential for diagnosing, managing and treating a wide variety of medical conditions. However, the obstacles for implementation of AI/ML in daily clinical practice are numerous, especially regarding the regulation of these technologies. Therefore, we provide an insight into the currently available AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms that have been approved by the US Food &amp; Drugs Administration (FDA). We aimed to raise awareness of the importance of regulatory bodies, clearly stating whether a medical device is AI/ML based or not. Cross-checking and validating all approvals, we identified 64 AI/ML based, FDA approved medical devices and algorithms. Out of those, only 29 (45%) mentioned any AI/ML-related expressions in the official FDA announcement. The majority (85.9%) was approved by the FDA with a 510(k) clearance, while 8 (12.5%) received de novo pathway clearance and one (1.6%) premarket approval (PMA) clearance. Most of these technologies, notably 30 (46.9%), 16 (25.0%), and 10 (15.6%) were developed for the fields of Radiology, Cardiology and Internal Medicine/General Practice respectively. We have launched the first comprehensive and open access database of strictly AI/ML-based medical technologies that have been approved by the FDA. The database will be constantly updated.At the beginning of the artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) era, the expectations are high, and experts foresee that AI/ ML shows potential for diagnosing, managing and treating a wide variety of medical conditions.

        <p>Despite its promise, the obstacles for implementation of AI/ML in daily clinical practice are numerous 10 . These include issues with transparency surrounding these software programs, the inherent bias in the data they are fed with and how secure they are. A crucial element shaping these obstacles is regulating such technologies. The very use of the term AI requires further clarification, as multiple subtypes have been proposed, and its meaning can be vague. For the sake of further investments and the public image, companies tend to overuse the term AI, when in fact they have developed algorithms which are not AI/ML-based per se.Despite its promise, the obstacles for implementation of AI/ML in daily clinical practice are numerous 10 .

        <p>We classify a technology as AI/ML based if official FDA announcements, communications by the company or other publicly available information resources used the expressions 'deep learning,' 'machine learning,' 'deep neural networks,' 'artificial intelligence,' and/or 'AI' to describe the technology 11 . For simplicity, we use the term "AI/ML-based" to denote these technologies in this paper.With the increasing expertise and attention on AI/ML in the medical field, the opportunities and possible implications of its use are the topics of an ongoing debate 12 .

        <p>As studies about AI's role in medicine show, its use cases and companies developing such technologies have been skyrocketing, regulatory bodies, such as the US Food &amp; Drugs Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA), have tried to tackle its regulation and implementation. As the FDA has shown leadership regarding the adoption of AI/ML-based medical technologies, with a specific framework for AI/ML-based algorithms, we chose it as an example for further analysis 13 .As studies about AI's role in medicine show, its use cases and companies developing such technologies have been skyrocketing, regulatory bodies, such as the US Food &amp; Drugs Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA), have tried to tackle its regulation and implementation.

        <p>Because of the high-risk nature of these medical devices and the unknown consequences of using AI/ML for medical decisionmaking and data analysis, the FDA has stringent regulatory requirements for medical device licensing. Developers of AI/MLbased medical devices and algorithms have to go through rigorous processes that are time and resource consuming. This can be considered pivotal as a barrier for the introduction of AI/ML in medicine.Because of the high-risk nature of these medical devices and the unknown consequences of using AI/ML for medical decisionmaking and data analysis, the FDA has stringent regulatory requirements for medical device licensing.

        <p>Before medical hardware or software is legally made available in the US market, the parent company has to submit it to the FDA for evaluation. For medically oriented AI/ML-based algorithms, the regulatory body has three levels of clearance, namely, 510(k) 14 , premarket approval 15 and the de novo pathway 16 , each of which needs specific criteria to be fulfilled in order to be granted (Table 1).Before medical hardware or software is legally made available in the US market, the parent company has to submit it to the FDA for evaluation.

        <p>For the development and marketing of medical algorithms, the FDA's stringent regulatory requirements pose important challenges to the companies developing them. Before, every new product had to go through the regulatory process. However, as companies update their algorithms on a much shorter time scale, namely in days, the FDA has realized that this process might become impossible to maintain. Therefore, the FDA started to consider "a total product lifecycle-based regulatory framework for these technologies that would allow for modifications to be made from real-world learning and adaptation, while still ensuring that the safety and effectiveness of the software as a medical device is maintained" 13 .For the development and marketing of medical algorithms, the FDA's stringent regulatory requirements pose important challenges to the companies developing them.

        <p>To date, the FDA has cleared or approved several medical devices using "locked" algorithms. They define a "locked" algorithm as an algorithm that provides the same result each time the same input is applied to it and does not change. However, many recent medical devices, especially when AI/ML based, use algorithms that change and can adapt over time; these are described by the FDA as adaptive algorithms, for which current regulatory frameworks were not designed 17 . The power of these AI/ML-based algorithms lies within the ability to continuously learn, where change to the algorithm might only be realized after the device or software has been distributed for use and could learn from real-world experience.To date, the FDA has cleared or approved several medical devices using "locked" algorithms.

        <p>An attempt to solve this issue was proposed in the FDA's proposed regulatory framework from 2019 18 , that "elaborates on a potential approach to premarket review for artificial intelligence and ML-driven software modifications" 13 . It is recognized by the FDA that these adaptive algorithms require a total product lifecycle (TPLC) regulatory approach, enabling rapid cycle of product improvement with effective safeguards.An attempt to solve this issue was proposed in the FDA's proposed regulatory framework from 2019 18 , that "elaborates on a potential approach to premarket review for artificial intelligence and ML-driven software modifications" 13 .

        <p>However, the FDA does not ask companies to categorize their technology as AI/ML based when in fact it is. And some companies mention that their technology is AI/ML based in the announcement of the FDA approval or the specific ML method they used, but others do not. We witnessed this issue while working on this paper ourselves.However, the FDA does not ask companies to categorize their technology as AI/ML based when in fact it is.

        <p>At this moment, the evaluation of the processes for approval and implementation is hampered by a lack of clarity on the approval of AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms, as FDA announcements do not clearly state the use of these methods. Moreover, the search engine of the FDA's website does not allow users to perform specific search queries in FDA announcements and summaries, thus hampering the accessibility of the database. It can be expected from regulatory bodies to provide a clear description of such devices; create and maintain a clear database, allowing proper search queries, to assess the implementation of new techniques. The FDA, like other regulatory agencies, has not done any of these yet.At this moment, the evaluation of the processes for approval and implementation is hampered by a lack of clarity on the approval of AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms, as FDA announcements do not clearly state the use of these methods.

        <p>In the beginning of the AI/ML era, it is especially important for the medical and scientific community to have a clear understanding of what medical technologies are considered AI/ML based and which ones are regulated to see how those can become elements of the toolset of medical professionals. Our database shows that it is possible to define the threshold for categorizing a technology as AI/ML based and also, that there is a need from regulatory agencies to create their own databases.In the beginning of the AI/ML era, it is especially important for the medical and scientific community to have a clear understanding of what medical technologies are considered AI/ML based and which ones are regulated to see how those can become elements of the toolset of medical professionals.

        <p>There are limitations to our approach. We aimed at determining the state of AI/ML-based medical devices and were met with three initial obstacles. (1) We chose to look only at regulated devices as companies tend to overhype the importance of their technology or simply use the terms AI and ML for the sake of more investments. (2) We chose to look at FDA approvals as the FDA has shown leadership in regulating AI/ML-based medical technologies and has published policies about that. And (3) we had to determine what should be considered as an AI/ML-based medical technology based on claims made in publicly available information sources.There are limitations to our approach.

        <p>While we aim to maintain the database along with contributions from the scientific community, the primary aim of the project is to encourage the FDA and other regulatory bodies to provide a clear overview of approved AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms.While we aim to maintain the database along with contributions from the scientific community, the primary aim of the project is to encourage the FDA and other regulatory bodies to provide a clear overview of approved AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms.</p>
        <p>These obstacles also describe the possible limitations of our approach. First, not all AI/ML-based medical devices have been approved by the FDA, therefore we had to exclude many unregulated technologies from the database. Second, there are numerous AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms in other countries outside the scope and supervision of the FDA. And third, as the FDA does not maintain such a database, we had to set the threshold for assessing what technology should be considered as AI based. It is possible that the terms and expressions we looked for could be too narrow for assessing AI/ML-based technologies.These obstacles also describe the possible limitations of our approach.

        <p>While the scope of solving these issues exceeded our capacity, we believe that this paper represents the results of a pioneering work. No other curated database of FDA approvals of AI/ML-based devices and algorithms that serve medical purposes exists. As such solutions become increasingly adapted in the healthcare setting, the importance of such an easily accessible database will become more apparent.While the scope of solving these issues exceeded our capacity, we believe that this paper represents the results of a pioneering work.

        <p>While we aim to maintain the database along with contributions from the scientific community, we encourage the FDA and other regulatory bodies to take over this database or launch their own. The EMA already provides guidelines and statements about AI and would benefit from the addition of such a repository. This will help those local and international institutions and the public as the use of AI/ML-based medical technologies in healthcare has become imminent.While we aim to maintain the database along with contributions from the scientific community, we encourage the FDA and other regulatory bodies to take over this database or launch their own.

        <p>Also, regulatory bodies could establish a clearer definition of what falls under the terms AI and ML This would also make it easier for developers, companies, researchers, journalists, and the general public to determine whether an approved technology is in fact AI/ML based.Also, regulatory bodies could establish a clearer definition of what falls under the terms AI and ML This would also make it easier for developers, companies, researchers, journalists, and the general public to determine whether an approved technology is in fact AI/ML based.</p>

        <p>On top of the rise in AI/ML-based algorithms, reports show a comparable increase in the global market size for AI/ML in healthcare. The value is projected to soon exceed US$28 billion from its 1 billion value in 2016 31 . Software and devices using the technology will inevitably contribute to this market share.On top of the rise in AI/ML-based algorithms, reports show a comparable increase in the global market size for AI/ML in healthcare.

        <p>However, despite the increasingly available AI/ML-based medical solutions on the market, there remains the factor of adopting those very solutions. The challenge to adopting these in the medical practice can be attributed to hindrances due to regulatory frameworks and trust issues with new technologies from both the physicians and patients side 32 .However, despite the increasingly available AI/ML-based medical solutions on the market, there remains the factor of adopting those very solutions.

        <p>There needs to be a paradigm shift when implementing new technologies, including AI/ML-based ones, in the healthcare system and key regulators play a crucial role in this as stated in the previous section.There needs to be a paradigm shift when implementing new technologies, including AI/ML-based ones, in the healthcare system and key regulators play a crucial role in this as stated in the previous section.</p>
        <p>According to our findings, there were no AI/ML-based devices approved by the FDA in 2010 and 2011. In the year 2012, we identified two while in 2019 alone, there were 22, amounting the number of relevant software programs to 64. In a decade, there was a major increase in the amount of these technologies.According to our findings, there were no AI/ML-based devices approved by the FDA in 2010 and 2011.

        <p>As new approvals of AI/ML-based medical technologies become available, it will become even more difficult to keep track of all relevant announcements. This open access database that we set up and will continuously maintain could help serve as a reference for interested parties working on similar software or for research purposes; and as such will hopefully be a useful tool for the medical and scientific community.As new approvals of AI/ML-based medical technologies become available, it will become even more difficult to keep track of all relevant announcements.

        <p>The most obvious method for our research would have been to check the official FDA database on FDA.gov and look for AI/ML-related terms in the summaries or approvals. The FDA's official website does feature a search engine option, making all of its announcements freely accessible. However, searches cannot be filtered according to their content such as approval announcements or specific words. Looking for AI/ML-related terms in this way is not possible on the FDA's search engine.The most obvious method for our research would have been to check the official FDA database on FDA.gov and look for AI/ML-related terms in the summaries or approvals.

        <p>In the next section, we outline the search strategy we chose to use that still ensures that all items in the database are cross-checked but could also mean that the database might not be complete. While not ideal, this issue also underscores the notion that the FDA's website could improve its search function with a filter feature so as to provide more streamlined results. Moreover, given that the database we built is open to submissions, we hope to make it as complete and as comprehensive as possible.In the next section, we outline the search strategy we chose to use that still ensures that all items in the database are cross-checked but could also mean that the database might not be complete.

        <p>Search strategy employed for the database For our search, we used a search strategy with the following steps: first, reliable resources, where FDA announcements appear regularly, were selected; second, these resources were used to identify relevant announcements; third, all identified announcements were cross-checked in the search engine of fda.gov.Search strategy employed for the database For our search, we used a search strategy with the following steps: first, reliable resources, where FDA announcements appear regularly, were selected; second, these resources were used to identify relevant announcements; third, all identified announcements were cross-checked in the search engine of fda.gov.</p>
        <p>Announcements from the websites listed were prioritized, scrutinized for relevant ones and then cross-checked on the FDA's website for the official approval: mobihealthnews.com; bmj.com; medscape.com; lancet.com; sciencedaily.com; radiologybusiness.com; and acrdsi.org. In the announcements, we had to focus on key words that would point to the use of AI/ML in a medically oriented device or software that has been approved by the FDA (Fig. 2).Announcements from the websites listed were prioritized, scrutinized for relevant ones and then cross-checked on the FDA's website for the official approval: mobihealthnews.com; bmj.com; medscape.com; lancet.com; sciencedaily.com; radiologybusiness.com; and acrdsi.org.

        <p>As the FDA does not have a threshold for marking devices as AI/MLbased, our observations showed that the most logical way to determine if a software program or device can be considered as AI/ML based is if the official FDA announcement contains any of these expressions: "machine learning", "deep learning", "deep neural networks", "artificial intelligence", and/or "AI." Taking this into consideration, we used the following search strategy: ("FDA approval" OR "FDA clearance" OR "Approved by the FDA") AND "Machine learning" OR "Deep learning" OR "Deep neural networks" OR "artificial intelligence" OR "AI").As the FDA does not have a threshold for marking devices as AI/MLbased, our observations showed that the most logical way to determine if a software program or device can be considered as AI/ML based is if the official FDA announcement contains any of these expressions: "machine learning", "deep learning", "deep neural networks", "artificial intelligence", and/or "AI."

        <p>Nevertheless, we found that not all announcements use these terms even if the underlying algorithm can be defined as AI/ML based. For example, when looking for a specific device like AliveCor Inc.'s Kardia, the FDA announcement does not mention any of the expressions we looked for, while the company elsewhere states that their device uses an AI/MLbased algorithm 34 . We decided to include these devices and algorithms as well, although we clearly marked in the database that the related FDA announcements do not contain any of the expressions we looked for. Instead, we included those not FDA-related announcements with a URL that did.Nevertheless, we found that not all announcements use these terms even if the underlying algorithm can be defined as AI/ML based.

        <p>We performed search queries for the time period between the 1st of January 2010 and the 1st of March 2020. As AI/ML-based technologies in medicine started gaining attention in the mid-2010s, we chose a longer time period to avoid missing important announcements. Once a relevant software program or product was identified from one of those websites, its authenticity was verified on fda.gov and recorded in our database with the accompanying FDA approval number.We performed search queries for the time period between the 1st of January 2010 and the 1st of March 2020.
