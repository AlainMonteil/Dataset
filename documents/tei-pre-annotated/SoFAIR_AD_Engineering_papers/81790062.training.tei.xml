        <p>The Al-rich part of the Fe-Al phase diagram between 50 and 80 at.% Al including the complex intermetallic phases Fe 5 Al 8 (e), FeAl 2 , Fe 2 Al 5 , and Fe 4 Al 13 was re-investigated in detail. A series of 19 alloys was produced and heat-treated at temperatures in the range from 600 to 1100 °C for up to 5000 h. The obtained data were further complemented by results from a number of diffusion couples, which helped to determine the homogeneity ranges of the phases FeAl 2 , Fe 2 Al 5 , and Fe 4 Al 13 . All microstructures were inspected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and chemical compositions of the equilibrium phases as well as of the alloys were obtained by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Crystal structures and the variation of the lattice parameters were studied by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) was applied to measure all types of transition temperatures.

        <p>Many investigations were done in the Fe-Al system since the 1920s regarding its capability as a replacement for steels due to the outstanding oxidation resistance at high temperatures and to the low density of Fe-Al based alloys. [1][2][3] These properties, which should improve with increasing Al content, strongly contribute to its candidate role as a high temperature structural material. However, the Al-rich part of the Fe-Al phase diagram with &gt;50 at.% Al has not yet been finally determined. Five different intermetallic phases were identified by previous studies in this composition range, and their crystal structure details are listed in Table 1. The FeAl phase has a simple cubic (B2-type) crystal structure, whereas the Al-rich intermetallic phases FeAl 2 , Fe 2 Al 5 , and Fe 4 Al 13 have complex structures of the triclinic, orthorhombic and monoclinic type, respectively. 1 The high-temperature phase Fe 5 Al 8 , which was designated only as e phase in the literature due to its for long time unknown structure, decomposes on cooling in a rapid eutectoid reaction and cannot be quenched to room temperature. Therefore, its crystal structure was determined only recently and was found to be of the body-centered cubic Cu 5 Zn 8 type. [5,6] The equilibrium diagram of the Fe-Al system in the range between 50 and 100 at.% Al was initially studied already in the 20s and 30s of the last century. [11][12][13][14][15][16][17] During the following about 80 years, only comparatively few more data were published contributing to this part of the phase diagram. [18][19][20][21][22][23][24] All available information was carefully assessed by Kubaschewski [25] and later on in the comprehensive overview of Kattner and Burton [26] that provides the most commonly used version of the Fe-Al phase diagram. More recent assessments of the experimental data were published by Burkhardt et al. [27] (however not containing a plotted phase diagram) and, most recently, by Turchanin et al. [28] The phase diagram in the latter publication is qualitatively identical to the version of Kattner and Burton, but some invariant reaction temperatures were corrected using DTA results provided by Stein and Palm. [29] Figure 1(a) shows the Al-rich Fe-Al phase diagram as assessed by Kattner and Burton [26] including all relevant experimental data from the literature, and Fig. 1(b) presents a magnification of the high-temperature part of the diagram in the range between 50 and 90 at.% Al clearly revealing a strong scatter of the experimental data. This applies to the liquidus and all invariant reaction temperatures as well as to the homogeneity ranges of all occurring intermetallic phases as is briefly described in the following:Many investigations were done in the Fe-Al system since the 1920s regarding its capability as a replacement for steels due to the outstanding oxidation resistance at high temperatures and to the low density of Fe-Al based alloys.

        <p>There is general agreement in the literature that the hightemperature phase Fe 5 Al 8 forms peritectically from the liquid and FeAl and decomposes by a eutectoid reaction into FeAl and FeAl 2 . The literature values obtained from thermal analysis for the reaction temperatures vary strongly ranging from 1207 to 1232 °C for the peritectic reaction and from 1080 to 1103 °C for the eutectoid reaction. [13,14,16,19,21,29] This significant scatter in the invariant reaction temperatures is also reflected in the differing values reported in the four assessments, [25][26][27][28] see Table 2. For comparison, also calculated data from thermodynamic modelling applying the CALPHAD approach are given (Table 3).

Contact e-mail: x.li@mpie.de. Fe 5 Al 8 and Fe 2 Al 5 form a eutectic at 68-69 at.% Al and at a temperature in the range 1153 °C [15] to 1166 °C. [14] Only few degrees below this temperature, FeAl 2 forms in a peritectoid reaction from the phases Fe 5 Al 8 and Fe 2 Al 5 . The scatter in the reported experimental reaction temperatures is similar as above, but the temperature interval between these two reactions is always about 10 °C (see also Table 2). This is worth to be mentioned because this finding is quite different from results of thermodynamic modelling, which in all cases give a much smaller interval of only 1-2 °C (see Table 3There is general agreement in the literature that the hightemperature phase Fe 5 Al 8 forms peritectically from the liquid and FeAl and decomposes by a eutectoid reaction into FeAl and FeAl 2 .

        <p>There is some controversy in the literature about the reaction type of the formation of Fe 4 Al 13 . The question is whether the phase forms peritectically (L + Fe 2 Al 5 M Fe 4 Al 13 ) [15,21] or congruently from the melt (L M Fe 4 Al 13 ). [14,19,22] Most of the assessments tend to the peritectic version (see e.g. Tables 2 and3). In any case, the respective peritectic/eutectic composition will be very near to that of the melting point of Fe 4 Al 13 ., as is also indicated in Kattner and Burton's version, see Fig. 1(b).There is some controversy in the literature about the reaction type of the formation of Fe 4 Al 13 .

        <p>Information about the homogeneity ranges of the different phases is only very scarce in the literature. For the hightemperature phase Fe 5 Al 8 , Kattner and Burton [26] estimate a composition range from 58 to 65 at.% Al. The homogeneity ranges of the Al-richer phases FeAl 2 , Fe 2 Al 5 , and Fe 4 Al 13 are much smaller. In Kattner and Burton's assessment, widths of 0.9 at.% (66.0 to 66.9 at.% Al), 3 at.% (70 to 73 at.% Al), and 2.1 at.% (74.5 to 76.6 at.% Al), respectively, are reported. [26] In a more recent study on the Fe-Al-Zr phase diagram, [34] values of 1.8, 2.2, 0.7 at.% were given for the widths of the homogeneity ranges of these intermetallic compounds at 1000 °C.Information about the homogeneity ranges of the different phases is only very scarce in the literature.

        <p>Summarizing the above and having in mind that several lines in the Al-rich part of the Fe-Al phase diagram are still drawn as dotted lines today, it can be stated that this part of the Fe-Al system deserves more detailed investigations. Therefore, in the present work a series of Fe-Al alloys with 57 to 79 at.% Al was produced and measured by DTA to obtain all reaction temperatures. Selected alloys were heattreated in the range from 600 to 1100 °C for up to 5000 h to study the resulting microstructures and phase equilibria by SEM and EPMA. In addition, a number of diffusion couples made of Fe-50Al (alloy compositions are given in at.% throughout this paper) and pure Al were produced to get further information about the homogeneity ranges of FeAl 2 , Fe 2 Al 5 and Fe 4 Al 13 phases. Crystal structures and lattice parameter variations were studied by XRD. By combining all experimental results, a revised phase diagram was finally constructed.Summarizing the above and having in mind that several lines in the Al-rich part of the Fe-Al phase diagram are still drawn as dotted lines today, it can be stated that this part of the Fe-Al system deserves more detailed investigations.

        <p>A series of Fe-Al binary alloys with nominal compositions between 57 and 79 at.% Al was produced from high purity Fe (99.98 wt.%) and Al (99.99 wt.%) by vacuum induction melting or levitation melting with casting into a cold copper mould, or by arc melting (Table 4). In all cases, these processes were performed in pure argon. EPMA was applied to determine the actual chemical compositions of all alloys. The analyzed compositions, which are listed in Table 4, were found to agree with the nominal compositions within 1.0 at.% Al. Pieces of each alloy were cut by electrical discharge machining (EDM) and encapsulated in quartz tubes back-filled with argon and were heat-treated at different temperatures for times as given in Table 4. Besides the series of cast alloys, three diffusion couples between an Fe-50Al alloy and pure Al were prepared and heat-treated at 620 °C (solid-solid diffusion couple), 800 and 850 °C (solid-liquid diffusion couples) in an Ar atmosphere. The first diffusion couple consisted of 595910 mm 3 cuboid shaped parts which were connected to each other directly with light pressure by using Mo clamps. The second diffusion couple was made of one pure Al cylinder of 8 mm in diameter and 8 mm in height, which was pressed in a cylinder-shaped hole with the same dimensions in a block of Fe-50Al alloy. The whole assembly was covered with a 5 mm thick lid made of the Fe-50Al alloy, placed in an alumina crucible, and completely covered with alumina powder. On top of the alumina powder, some Ti filings were added as an oxygen getter. The third diffusion couple was made of two cylinders of pure Al and Fe-50Al alloy (both 18 mm in diameter and 10 mm in height) with the Fe-50Al cylinder placed on top of the pure Al piece inside an alumina crucible. Again this diffusion couple was covered with alumina powder and Ti filings were used as getter material. All diffusion couples were furnace-cooled.

        <p>Microstructures were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL-6490 instrument with a working distance of 10 mm. Chemical compositions of individual phases were established by wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS) carried out on an EPMA JEOL JXA-8100. The instrument was operated at 15 kV and 20 nA. The pure elements were used as standards. Crystal structures of the phases were identified by XRD of powdered samples, which were easily obtained by crushing in a steel mortar. On a Seifert ID 3003 x-ray diffraction instrument, the 2h range from 20°to 130°was scanned using Co-K a1 radiation (k = 0.17890 nm). The program

        <p>The composition of the Al-poor and -rich limit of the homogeneity range of Fe 5 Al 8 cannot be directly measured but can be extrapolated from the DTA results. Figure 3 shows the Fe 5 Al 8 phase region of the Fe-Al phase diagram as obtained by the present DTA experiments. The reaction temperatures for the peritectic formation and eutectoid decomposition are 1231 and 1095 °C, respectively. Both, the entrance and exit of the Fe 5 Al 8 single-phase field can be well measured by DTA giving the shape of the phase field as shown in Fig. 3. From this information, the homogeneity range of Fe 5 Al 8 is found to extend from 56.0 to 64.5 at.% Al. Some representative as-cast microstructures of Fe-Al alloys in the composition range from 67 to 79 at.% Al are shown in Fig. 4 and5. The microstructure of the as-cast alloy Fe-66.8Al (Fig. 4a), which should be single-phase FeAl 2 in the equilibrium state at room temperature, contains three different phases FeAl (light contrast in BSE mode), FeAl 2 (grey), and Fe 2 Al 5 (dark). This observation can be well explained by the fact that FeAl 2 does not form congruently from the melt but in the solid state in a peritectoid type of reaction. Coming from the liquid state, the first solidification step is the precipitation of Fe 5 Al 8 phase, which in a later stage of cooling transforms into a fine mixture of FeAl + FeAl 2 (white-grey mixture in the core of the grains). The rest of the liquid solidifies eutectically into Fe 5 Al 8 and Fe 2 Al 5 and only then, in the completely solidified state, FeAl 2 grows peritectoidally between the two phases Fe 5 Al 8 and Fe 2 Al 5 . As Fig. 4(b) shows and as is expected from the phase diagram, this threephase as-cast microstructure transforms completely to single-phase FeAl 2 by heat treatment at elevated temperatures.The composition of the Al-poor and -rich limit of the homogeneity range of Fe 5 Al 8 cannot be directly measured but can be extrapolated from the DTA results.

        <p>As mentioned in the introduction, there is still uncertainty about the reaction type leading to the formation of Fe 4 Al 13 (peritectic or congruent). In case this phase forms congruently from the melt, there must be a eutectic between Fe 2 Al 5 and Fe 4 Al 13 . The as-cast microstructure of the alloy Fe-72.9Al in Fig. 4(c) shows Fe 2 Al 5 primary dendrites embedded in an Fe 4 Al 13 matrix. There are no indications of a eutectic reaction. Therefore, either the eutectic point is extremely near to the congruent melting point or the reaction is of the peritectic type. As there are no indications of a eutectic, we stick with the peritectic version. In Fig. 5(a), the as-cast microstructure of the alloy Fe-74.2Al is presented. It does not show any Fe 2 Al 5 phase and appears completely single-phase Fe 4 Al 13 . This is also true for the ascast alloys Fe-74.5Al and Fe-74.9Al (see also Table 4).As mentioned in the introduction, there is still uncertainty about the reaction type leading to the formation of Fe 4 Al 13 (peritectic or congruent). In case this phase forms congruently from the melt, there must be a eutectic between Fe 2 Al 5 and Fe 4 Al 13 .

[31] Sundman et al. [32] Jacobs and Schmid-Fetzer [33] L + FeAl M Fe 5 While the eutectic/peritectic temperatures are clearly visible in the heating curves and can usually be determined with an accuracy of ±1 or 2 °C, this is not the case for the liquidus temperatures due to the partially very small temperature intervals between solidus and liquidus. In order to get the correct values for the liquidus temperatures, they were determined according to a method described in detail in Ref 38 using both the heating and cooling curves. Nonetheless, the accuracy of some of the determined liquidus values is only ±4 °C. Therefore, the DTA data are not adequate to exclude definitely the existence of a eutectic point near 75 to 76 at.% Al. As such a eutectic composition would be inside the homogeneity range of Fe 4 Al 13 at intermediate temperatures (see final phase diagram in Fig. 10), the eutectic microstructure would not be visible at room temperature. On the basis of all DTA results, the high-temperature part of the phase diagram between 65 and 80 at.% Al was drawn as shown in Fig. 7. In order to study the equilibrium compositions and homogeneity ranges of all phases concerned, heat treatments in the range of 600 to 1100 °C were performed as is listed in Table 4. The resulting equilibrium phase compositions are [35] Fig. 3 Phase field of the high-temperature phase Fe 5 Al 8 as determined by DTA given in Table 7. In addition, the occurring phases and their lattice parameters were studied by XRD. As an example, Fig. 8 shows a comparison of the XRD patterns of as-cast and heat-treated (800 °C/200 h) Fe-69.4Al. In the as-cast state only the peaks characteristic for the crystal structure of Fe 2 Al 5 are visible, while after the heat treatment the reflections of both FeAl 2 and Fe 2 Al 5 can be clearly detected in good agreement with the microstructural observations (see Table 4). The lattice parameters obtained from some selected heat-treated alloys are listed in Table 8. As expected, the unit cell volume of a certain phase increases with increasing Al content due to the larger atomic size of Al compared to Fe. As already mentioned in the section 2, in addition to heat-treated alloys of fixed compositions, three diffusion couples between Fe-50Al and pure Al were used for determining equilibrium phase compositions and homogeneity ranges of the intermetallic phases (Table 5). This method takes advantage of the local equilibrium existing at the phase interfaces. The concentration profiles resulting from the heat treatments were measured by EPMA with step widths of 1 lm. As an example, Fig. 9 7. The growth kinetics of the intermetallic phases differs very much from each other. As is well-known from the literature and nicely confirmed in Fig. 9(a), Fe 2 Al 5 grows much quicker than the other phases, and FeAl 2 often grows so slowly that it is hardly visible or totally missing. This happened in case of the present solid-solid diffusion couple (620 °C for 5 h), where the concentration directly jumps from that of FeAl to Fe 2 Al 5 .Table 3 Invariant reaction temperatures in the Al-rich part of the Fe-Al system as obtained from thermodynamic modelling based on the CALPHAD approach [30][31][32][33] Invariant reaction Reaction temperature from CALPHAD modelling, °C Seierstein [30] Du et al.
