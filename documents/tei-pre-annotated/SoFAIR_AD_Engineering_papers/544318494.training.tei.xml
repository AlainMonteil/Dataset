        <p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new generation of materials that exhibit unique characteristics and properties, and are demonstrating potential in the form of thermal spray coatings for demanding environments. The use of HEAs as feedstock for coating processes has advanced due to reports of their exceptional properties in both bulk and coating forms. Emerging reports of thermal sprayed HEA coatings outperforming conventional materials have accelerated further exploration of this field. This early-stage review discusses the outcomes of combining thermal spray and HEAs. Various synthesis routes adopted for HEA feedstock preparation and their properties are discussed, with reference to the requirements of thermal spray processing. The HEA feedstock is then compared and correlated with coating microstructure and phase composition as a function of the thermal spray processing route. Subsequently, the mechanical behavior of thermal spray HEA coatings is summarized in terms of porosity, hardness, and tribological properties, along with their oxidation and electrochemical properties, followed by their potential applications. The thermal spray methods are contrasted against laser cladding and surface alloying techniques for synthesizing thick HEA coatings. Furthermore, HEAs that have displayed excellent properties via alternative processing routes, but have not been explored within the framework of thermal spray, are recommended.High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new generation of materials that exhibit unique characteristics and properties, and are demonstrating potential in the form of thermal spray coatings for demanding environments.

        <p>The performance of a material in industrial applications is associated with its surface characteristics. The wide availability of surface modification technologies permits an economic substitution of a poor base material with a coating that exhibits more desirable surface characteristics and performance. Surface modification is highly valuable in conditions involving corrosive environments, wear protection, thermal insulation, or severe stress applications. For instance, in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), yttriastabilized zirconia (YSZ) is used as an overlay protective coating to shield the nickel or cobalt based superalloys from extreme high temperature conditions. Thermal spray coating (TSC) is a versatile and rapidly growing surface modification technology.The performance of a material in industrial applications is associated with its surface characteristics.

        <p>Thermal spraying is a line-of-sight process, wherein feedstock material, in the form of powder, wire, rod, or suspension, is fed into a spray torch and heated up to a molten or near-molten state and propelled toward a base material (Ref 1-3).

Figure 1 (Ref 4) illustrates the flexibility offered by TS in terms of the wide spectrum of flame temperature-particle velocities available. Plasma spray (atmospheric and vacuum), high-velocity arc spray, HVOF, warm spray, and cold spray have been employed to synthesize thermal sprayed HEA coatings. Atmospheric plasma spray (APS) is the most versatile thermal spray technique that holds few limitations concerning the materials that can be sprayed. Therefore, APS is well established at the industrial level (Ref 5). A feedstock (powder or wire) is introduced into the plasma stream where complete or partial melting may occur, eventually depositing as lamellar splats onto the substrate. Numerous process parameters, of which the prime ones are gas flow rate, power input, carrier gas flow rate, stand-off distance, and powder feed-rate, are crucial in determining the coating density, quality, and uniformity. APS is economically attractive since this manufacturing process is performed under ambient conditions, with the primary drawback being in-flight oxidation (IFO) of feedstock particles. APS is best suited for forming ceramic coatings with porosity of less than several percent but can be optimized to reduce oxidation of metal powders. The alternative is to spray with an inert gas shroud, or in a soft vacuum/reducing atmosphere, but the cost of employing a vacuum system, e.g., by low-pressure vacuum spraying, increases by an order of magnitude.&amp; Andrew Siao Ming Ang aang@swin.edu.au combustion heat sources, for example detonation gun or high-velocity oxygen fuel spray (HVOF); (2) plasma or arc formation using electrical energy, for example atmospheric plasma spray (APS); and (3) low-temperature processes that use energy evolving from gas expansion, for example cold spray (CS).

        <p>HVOF falls under the ambit of combustion spray processes. A hydrocarbon fuel (C x H y ; typically, kerosene, methane, propane, propylene, acetylene or natural gas) is ignited with an oxidizer (air or oxygen). The temperature and pressure so generated then heat and accelerate feedstock particles towards the substrate. Laval nozzles are used to further accelerate the particles up to speeds of 2000 m/s. Although particle temperatures are lower than those achieved in plasma spray (Fig. 1), higher particle speeds result in lower IFO and better coating densities, with porosity that may be less than 1 percent.HVOF falls under the ambit of combustion spray processes.

        <p>Cold spray (also termed as 'kinetic spray') accelerates feedstock particles by means of a high-pressure gas that passes through a de Laval nozzle (Ref 6, 7).

        <p>Figure 1 (Ref 4) illustrates the spread of particle size, temperature, and velocity offered by TS processes. Using this scheme, an appropriate processing window can be identified based on the nature of the feedstock material (metallic/ceramic) and the desired coating microstructure, such as density and phase content. For example, for ceramic coatings with a predetermined porosity requirement, such as hydroxyapatite coatings for orthopedic applications, APS would be preferred. However, for depositing dense metal coatings, such as coating aluminum alloys on magnesium parts for corrosion protection, cold spray would be the preferred method.Figure 1 (Ref 4) illustrates the spread of particle size, temperature, and velocity offered by TS processes.

        <p>TS technology has seen developments in feedstock materials across metal alloys, composites, intermetallics, ceramics, and cermets, the exact choice depending on the final application. High-quality feedstock, with respect to particle size distribution (referred to as the 'cut') and particle morphology, is vital to produce high-quality coatings (Ref 4,8). The simultaneous surge in harsh industrial conditions and incremental development in conventional materials has pushed materials research toward the development of new alloys, for instance high-entropy alloys (HEAs). The adoption of these new HEA feedstocks will potentially allow novel surface engineering solutions that are tailored for demanding industrial environments.TS technology has seen developments in feedstock materials across metal alloys, composites, intermetallics, ceramics, and cermets, the exact choice depending on the final application.

        <p>A current major focus of HEA research has been directed to decoding the science governing the fundamental nature of these multicomponent alloys. The stabilization of solid solution phases at elevated temperatures arises due to a combination of mixing enthalpy, higher configurational entropy, and similar atomic characteristics (atomic radius, valency, crystal structure) (Ref 14) that favors the formation of solid solutions such as FCC or BCC over intermetallic compounds (Ref 15,16). The combined interactions among all the integral elements, termed as 'cocktail effects' (Ref 17), promote these distinctive attributes of HEAs. This is reflected in the development of bulk HEAs with wear resistance (Ref 18,19), oxidation (Ref 20,21) and corrosion resistance (Ref 22), and mechanical properties (Ref [23][24][25][26] that have outperformed traditional materials. These technical advantages are now being translated to coatings via thermal spray, laser cladding, and sputtering processes.A current major focus of HEA research has been directed to decoding the science governing the fundamental nature of these multicomponent alloys.

        <p>Laser cladding, also termed as laser surface alloying, involves preparing a powder bed of feedstock slurry (generally, blended unalloyed elemental powders) onto the substrate and scanning it with a focused laser beam. In another variant of the process, termed 'direct laser deposition', feedstock powder is propelled coaxially with the laser beam, instead of preplacement as slurry. In both processes, melting of the substrate surface along with the feedstock slurry occurs, followed by rapid solidification and generation of a coating. While laser clad/surface-alloyed coatings are usually defect free and exhibit good metallurgical bonding with the substrate, the drawbacks include a heat-affected zone, extreme residual stresses, and possible deterioration of the HEA coating and substrate properties due to elemental dilution ( Ref 27). When prealloyed HEA powders are used as feedstock for laser cladding, the coating often consists of multiple alloy and intermetallic phases that may require further processing before the desired properties are achieved ( Ref 28).Laser cladding, also termed as laser surface alloying, involves preparing a powder bed of feedstock slurry (generally, blended unalloyed elemental powders) onto the substrate and scanning it with a focused laser beam.

        <p>Another prevalent technique for generating HEA coatings is via sputtering or vapor phase deposition in which the HEA is atomically deposited layer-by-layer (Ref 29). These processes result in thin films, and are increasingly being used to generate HEA carbide/nitride/boride films that exhibit excellent tribological properties (Ref 30). Reviews discuss these coating categories (Ref 31); however, a comprehensive review of HEA coatings manufactured by thermal spray methods is not available.Another prevalent technique for generating HEA coatings is via sputtering or vapor phase deposition in which the HEA is atomically deposited layer-by-layer (Ref 29).

        <p>The final microstructure and, hence, properties of the coatings not only depend on the thermal spray process but also on the synthesis routes and composition of the HEAs. It is notable that identical alloy chemistries, prepared via different feedstock synthesis techniques and thermal spray process parameters, resulted in different coating characteristics. This need not necessarily be a disadvantage, since knowledge concerning the physical metallurgical behavior guides the selection of the HEA elements for an intended application; for example, Al, Cr, Ti, Si for oxidation resistance; Cr for corrosion resistance; B2-forming Al-Ni/ Co/Fe, for wear resistance; and Co/Ni-based FCCs for enhanced plasticity are appropriate alloy constituents for HEAs. Multiple compositions can simultaneously be explored for their phase composition and expected properties using high-throughput experiments and computational techniques as demonstrated by Senkov et al. (Ref 36). The diversity of TS processes provides a tool to manipulate the characteristics of HEAs as coatings and tune them for specific applications. Four synthesis routes have been reported to construct HEA feedstocks for TS: (1) blending, (2) arc melting followed by mechanical milling, (3) mechanical alloying, and (4) gas atomization. Each technique imparts unique implications on the powder phase and characteristics and, therefore, on the coating microstructure and properties. The following discussion will focus on the particle size and morphology; extent of alloying and homogeneity; powder yield; and flowability, since these factors influence the TS processing.The final microstructure and, hence, properties of the coatings not only depend on the thermal spray process but also on the synthesis routes and composition of the HEAs.

        <p>Figure 4 outlines the particle size distributions with respect to the synthesis techniques as reported in the TS-HEA literature. It is evident that each process has a characteristic output size range, which further depends on the synthesis process parameters. Gas atomization provides the widest cut, that can then be tailored to the thermal spray process by sieving. On the other hand, mechanical alloying results in a much finer cut that exhibits nanocrystallinity.Figure 4 outlines the particle size distributions with respect to the synthesis techniques as reported in the TS-HEA literature.

        <p>Blending involves mixing the powders without promoting any bonding or alloying. The particle size and shape of the blended mix will retain elemental qualities, leading to individual interactions under APS processing and an inhomogeneous coating microstructure.

        <p>This method first fuses the desired alloy by arc melting. Then, the alloy button is crushed into smaller pieces, which is followed by ball milling into powder. The need for alloying at an elemental level is achieved by processing in the liquid state, while the requirement for the appropriate particle cut is accomplished by pulverization. Complex non-equiatomic compositions can be created by arc melting without incurring significant contamination from ball milling by this route.This method first fuses the desired alloy by arc melting.

        <p>Out of the four reports that employ this method, three reported ball milling to less than 44 lm particle size, while one is \ 34 lm, as illustrated in Fig. 4.

However, from the authors' experience, it is estimated that up to 90% of the powder weight charged would be recovered in this process, thereby making it a high yield process. The particle shape is irregular since the particles are fragmented pieces of the cast button.

Each of these prime factors influences the extent of alloying, implying that there is no single distinct recipe for synthesizing an HEA via MA, unlike arc melting.Out of the four reports that employ this method, three reported ball milling to less than 44 lm particle size, while one is \ 34 lm, as illustrated in Fig. 4.

        <p>Another drawback concerns the particle size and morphology. The 'wet' MA route, which uses organic solvents such as toluene as PCAs, results in finer particles of irregular shape, \ 30 lm after 10 h of milling (Ref 34). In contrast, the 'dry' MA route, usually performed under argon atmosphere and at much higher rotation speeds, results in larger particles (20-75 lm) (Ref 43) with a wide Dry milling of metals and alloys leads to excessive cold welding and, hence, derives larger particles that are flaky in nature. In contrast, wet milling results in finer, sphericallike particles due to the presence of the liquid surrounding the particles, which prevents excessive agglomeration of particles. However, contamination in wet milling is a concern, and dry milling is preferred when it is necessary to avoid contamination from the milling medium. Higher milling speeds allow for higher impact energy input into the material. It must be noted, however, that ball milling and mechanical alloying is a highly stochastic process with multiple controlling parameters (Ref 41).Another drawback concerns the particle size and morphology.

There is also the issue of contamination from organic solvents and/or from the milling medium (e.g., stainless steel, tungsten carbide, zirconia) that may affect feedstock composition. As reported by Praveen et al. (Ref 45), the use of toluene as process control agent in MA of AlCrFeCo resulted in the formation of M 23 C 6 -type carbides on subsequent processing. While it was an unsolicited addition of carbon to the alloy, it improved the sintered alloy's thermal stability and mechanical properties, thereby illustrating both the advantages and deficiencies of this method.The powder characteristics influence powder flowability during its injection in TS, which generally prefers atomized prealloyed powder feedstock (Ref 44).

        <p>Finally, mechanically alloyed particles are nanocrystalline in nature with a grain size \ 15 nm, which can be leveraged depending on the thermal spray process and intended application. For example, Anupam et al. (Ref 46) cold-sprayed MA HEA powders on Ni-based superalloy substrate and, after 25 h of isothermal oxidation, observed the diffusion of molybdenum from the substrate into the coating, which may be attributed partly to nanocrystalline grain boundary diffusion. On the other hand, TSCs generated for MA feedstock are largely homogeneous, with a possibility of greater IFO promoted by the powder nanocrystallinity, especially if the process is associated with a high temperature as experienced in APS.Finally, mechanically alloyed particles are nanocrystalline in nature with a grain size \ 15 nm, which can be leveraged depending on the thermal spray process and intended application.

        <p>A variation of the MA/MM process has been used by Srivastava et al. (Ref 47) to develop HEA feedstock for HVOF processing. Starting with milling elemental powders for 2 h in toluene, followed by drying in Ar, the powders were compacted into green pellets and subjected to pyrolysis in argon at 1100 °C for 1 h. Alloying is expected to have occurred at this stage. The pellets were then crushed and sieved. Spray drying in a 6 wt.% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) suspension was carried out to agglomerate the fine powders. This method, while protracted, avoids the nanocrystallinity and contamination incurred from MA, as well as conferring the desired particle size. However, care must be exercised to confirm alloy formation and homogeneity throughout the process.A variation of the MA/MM process has been used by Srivastava et al.

        <p>Inert gas atomization is the preferred technique for manufacturing feedstock for TS. It has gained popularity in the HEA coating community and is the most used synthesis method. Gas atomization involves forcing the liquid alloy through a nozzle under high pressure within an inert gas environment. The liquid stream fragments into spherical droplets that rapidly solidify (Ref 48). Faster cooling allows phase separation to occur only at very fine scales, as illustrated in Fig. 7 (Ref 49), and can usually be mitigated during spraying or annealing after coating. Gas atomization is appealing because it results in spherical particles with good flowability and homogeneous alloy formation. The wide size ranges of particles can be sieved to desired size cuts.Inert gas atomization is the preferred technique for manufacturing feedstock for TS.

        <p>In summary: GA is tailor made for synthesizing feedstock for thermal spray processes and is suitable for HEAs. Mechanical alloying presents a strong alternate method, although requiring milling parameter optimization and being time intensive.

        <p>In contrast to usual prealloyed feedstock for thermal spray processes, laser cladding with HEAs is carried out with blended elemental powders mixed into a binder to form a thick slurry, which is preplaced on the substrate and exposed to the laser beam. The slurry melts under the laser beam to form a melt pool that allows mixing and alloying of the blended powders. The melt pool solidifies rapidly at 10 3 -10 6 K/s after passing of the laser beam and supersaturated solid solutions and intermetallic phases are often observed. There are several reports of laser clad HEA coatings using alloy powders synthesized via mechanical alloying (Ref 50) or gas atomization (Ref 51) rather than employing elemental blends. In another variation of laser cladding, termed 'laser surface alloying', the alloy coating is formed by mixing elements of the feedstock and the molten substrate. This transforms the otherwise detrimental problem of elemental dilution from the substrate (Ref 52) into a benefit. Several process parameters, primarily laser power, defocus distance, scanning speed, and track overlap, must be optimized for desirable results.

        <p>The microstructure of a TSC depends strongly on the type of TS method, the specific TS parameters, and the nature of the feedstock. The TS technique includes a multitude of coating parameters that are designated within 'spray tables,' e.g., plasma current and voltage; primary and secondary gas flow rates for plasma spray; carrier gas flow rate; stand-off distance; and design and dimensions of the nozzle for HVOF, D-gun, and cold spray processes. The HEA feedstock characteristics also govern the coating microstructure, which is strongly related to the feedstock synthesis technique (described in the previous section). Therefore, both the feedstock and TS process must be optimized to achieve a repeatable coating that is free from undesirable phases and adverse microstructural artifacts. This section delineates the effects of the TS technique used with respect to the as-sprayed microstructure of HEAs.The microstructure of a TSC depends strongly on the type of TS method, the specific TS parameters, and the nature of the feedstock.

        <p>It is important to note that depending on the feedstock processing route and TS route chosen, the alloy may be prone to phase transformations. For example, HEA powders synthesized via mechanical alloying result in metastable and often supersaturated solid solution phases. These powders, when sprayed by relatively high-temperature HVOF or APS processes, will undergo melting and rapid solidification, once again resulting in supersaturated solid solution phases. There is also a possibility of in-flight oxidation (IFO) resulting in a composite alloy-oxide splat microstructure. On the other hand, coatings produced via low-temperature techniques such as cold spray or warm spray will tend to retain the feedstock phases. There is further scope to induce phase changes in the coating microstructure by post-processing, by thermal treatments and/or laser remelting of the coating surface, as is elucidated in ''Post Processing of TS Coatings'' section.It is important to note that depending on the feedstock processing route and TS route chosen, the alloy may be prone to phase transformations.

        <p>The earliest published work on thermal sprayed HEAs is by Huang et al. (Ref 32) and is among the first reports on highentropy alloys as a concept. Their report on air plasmasprayed AlSiTiCrFeCoNiMo 0.5 and AlSiTiCrFeNiMo 0.5 initiated the field of TS-HEA coatings, buoyed by initial but promising results on the improved oxidation and wear resistance of the coatings vis-a `-vis traditional materials. The effect of synthesis route on the HEA's microstructures is reflected from the phases observed. While the as-cast alloys consisted of B2 ? FCC1 ? FCC2 phases and a typical dendritic microstructure, only single-phase BCC splats along with several unidentified oxide phases were detected in the coatings. This is attributed to the melting followed by rapid solidification in the APS process, resulting in a supersaturated solid solution. Another aspect introduced by APS processing concerns IFO, which is a major issue when dealing with oxygen-sensitive materials. In this case, Al, Cr, Ti, and Mo are all oxygen active elements and likely constitute the many oxides detected by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the coating. Nevertheless, the coating showed encouraging wear and oxidation resistance in comparison with traditional materials and laid the groundwork for the field of TS-HEA coatings.The earliest published work on thermal sprayed HEAs is by Huang et al.

        <p>It is worthwhile to mention that reducing the extent of IFO of traditional materials during APS by varying process parameters has been researched ( Ref 53,54). A major theme of these articles is that addition of a shrouded environment vastly reduces the IFO of the feedstock. Azarmi et al. (Ref 55) in an experiment designed to delineate the effects of process parameters on the oxide content and porosity of APS Alloy 625 coatings found that the primary gas flow rate, particle size, and stand-off distance most affected the extent of IFO. In the field of APS-HEAs, as will be discussed in ''AlCrFeCoNi Coatings'' section, IFO has been found to depend strongly on the feedstock synthesis route, particle size, distribution, and the primary gas flow rate during spraying. Liang et al. (Ref 56) reported CrFeCoNiCu(B) coatings synthesized by high-velocity arc spraying. The feedstock consisted of blended HEA powders extruded into cored wires and used as consumable electrodes with opposite polarities. An arc is struck between these electrodes, thus melting the wire ends, and compressed air flow is used to atomize and propel the molten droplets toward the substrate where they solidify and form the coating. A dense (\ 5% porosity) coating, consisting of FCC phase splats and a dark phase that maybe oxide or an unidentified interstitial solid solution, was formed that exhibited a good interface with the substrate. The novelty of this work lies in the addition of boron in the alloy, which they credit to prevent IFO because boron acts as a sacrificial oxygen getter. These coatings exhibited good hardness and bond strengths, lending confidence to this TS method for synthesizing HEA coatings.

Subsequently, the GA powders were sieved into two cuts, small (10-60 lm) and large (60-90 lm) and sprayed under several plasma current and argon gas flow conditions. Increasing the plasma current increases the temperature of the plasma, as does raising the primary Ar gas flow, and thus the particle temperature rises. Smaller particles gave rise to a major BCC with minor FCC ? oxide microstructure at lower plasma powers, which transformed to FCC becoming the major phase at higher plasma power.The powder particles were also observed to melt far below the melting temperature of 1362 °C of the cast alloys, manifesting as B2 ?

        <p>Three of these coatings are illustrated in Fig. 8 and highlight the differences in coating microstructures as a function of spray parameters. These microstructures are reminiscent of those in Ang et al. (Ref 34)-MA-APS coatings, which also reported major FCC ? minor BCC ? oxides. While Ang et al. attribute the FCC phase formation to the depletion of Al from the HEA due to IFO (Al is a BCC stabilizer in Al x CrFeCoNi at x C 0.8), Cheng et al. attribute the FCC phase stabilization to particles being annealed. A combination of both factors could be in force since significant oxidation occurs in the case of Cheng et al.'s low-energy input coatings. Interestingly, the larger particles, which could retain more heat and remain molten longer than smaller particles, did not transform to FCC. Coatings generated using higher-energy inputs and larger particle sizes exhibited good melting and splat behavior, with negligible IFO, albeit with some interlamellar cracking.Three of these coatings are illustrated in Fig. 8 and highlight the differences in coating microstructures as a function of spray parameters.

They also provide a model delineating the effects of particle size and temperature during spraying and the consequential result in the coating. An example is illustrated in Fig. 9(a), where a medium-sized (5-15 lm) mechanically alloyed AlCrFe-CoNi particle is exposed to the highest temperature zone (particle temperatures of 1200-2300 °C) of the plasma plume. It is theorized that such particles would melt completely, spheroidize, and oxidize partially in flight. They would further splat on impact, with the possibility of splashing.

The blended powders were sprayed via APS and resulted in a non-homogeneous lamellar microstructure with larger splats of Ni60 and finer, more oxidized splats of the HEA. This microstructure may be correlated directly with differences in the feedstock; that is, HEA particles synthesized via mechanical alloying were finer, irregular, and nanocrystalline.

Warm spray is a modification of the HVOF process, where the gas flow rates are controlled to regulate the combustion rate and therefore the temperatures experienced by the feedstock particles (Ref 78). In terms of particle temperatures experienced, warm spray falls between cold spray and HVOF (Fig. 1), hence the eponym. BCC ? FCC ? Cr 3 Si ? oxide phases were observed in all the coatings. One major difference was that the feedstock was gas-atomized powder, as opposed to the AM ? MM powders used earlier, likely due to better flowability and higher yield offered by GA. Typical lamellar microstructures were observed in all three coatings, with salient differences appearing in the phase fractions and degree of IFO (Fig. 11). For instance, precipitation of the Cr 3 Si phase, which was observed in the as-cast and GA states, was subdued in APS and HVOF due to higher process temperatures that promoted the formation of supersaturated solid solutions.Learnings from previous studies on these compositions were used by Hsu et al.

        <p>Process temperatures in warm spray were sufficiently low to avoid phase transformations and allow retention of the BCC ? Cr 3 Si phase constitution of the feedstock, but high enough to allow particle deformation and improved inter-splat bonding. The WS microstructures are reminiscent of cold-sprayed AlCrFeCoNi coatings (Ref 46), which also retained feedstock phases, characterized by the deformation of alloy particles into splats with no IFO. The combined advantage of higher process temperatures and no IFO was critical in WS HEA coatings exhibiting better oxidation resistance than their HVOF and APS counterparts. Warm spray, thus, has also demonstrated excellent capability for spraying oxygen-and temperature-sensitive materials, which opens opportunities for the development of TS-HEA coatings.Process temperatures in warm spray were sufficiently low to avoid phase transformations and allow retention of the BCC ?

        <p>Annealing and heat treatment of the as-sprayed coating are conducted with two main objectives in mind. The first is to relieve strains incurred during rapid solidification and allow densification to occur. The second is to promote phase transformations such as precipitation from supersaturated alloy phases. Annealing can also be used to promote limited interdiffusion between the coating and substrate to improve bond strength without deteriorating the substrate properties. Annealing can also be used to homogenize coating chemistries that undergo low-temperature TS processes, as in the case of cold Laser remelting of a TS coating surface is the other popular post-processing technique. By controlling the laser parameters such as laser energy and scan rate, melting is limited to the top few tens of micrometers of the TS coating, effectively avoiding element dilution from the substrate. The alloy melt pool so formed is followed by rapid solidification, resulting in a dense and nearly defectfree coating. A columnar and dendritic (Ref 61, 75) microstructure with supersaturated solid solutions, governed by the rapid cooling rates, is often observed, as illustrated in Fig. 12. Laser remelting assists in fluxing out oxide splats that are formed during IFO during the APS/ HVOF process, thereby resulting in an oxide-free top layer of HEA coating (Ref 63). The sequential processes of TS and laser remelting may be combined to tailor HEA coatings with optimum mechanical and microstructural features for desired applications.Annealing and heat treatment of the as-sprayed coating are conducted with two main objectives in mind.

As evident from Fig. 14 The WS coatings of both HEAs achieved higher hardness (470-490 HV) in the as-sprayed state, than both APS and HVOF coatings (400-440 HV). The high hardness in WS coatings was attributed to its dense structure and the degree of Cr 3 Si precipitation compared to the supersaturated solid solutions for the other two spray processes. However, heat treatment at 800 °C for 10 h allowed Cr 3 Si precipitation to occur in the APS and HVOF coatings, thereby increasing their hardness over that of the warm-sprayed coating.Figure 14 compiles the hardness values reported in the TS HEA literature.

        <p>In a report published by Lin et al. (Ref 63), MA AlCr-FeCoNi HEA coatings were fabricated by supersonic APS and the influence of post-treatment on the structure and properties was investigated. The post-coating treatment included vacuum heat treatment at 600 and 900 °C for 10 h and then laser remelting at a power of 300 W. The average hardness (measured with a 1.96 N load and 10 s of dwell time) of the as-spayed coating was 177 HV 0.2 , which increased to 227 and 266 HV 0.2 post-vacuum heat-treated at 600 and 900 °C, respectively. Laser remelting of the assprayed AlCrFeCoNi coating enhanced the hardness significantly from 177 to 682 HV 0.2 , owing to the existence of a single-phase solid solution and AlNi 3 phase in the coating. In addition, hardness values were relatively stable throughout the coating surface. Mu was observed for the APS and HVOF coatings, respectively. The homogenous microstructure with low oxide and defects content in the HVOF coating was responsible for their higher microhardness, although it should be noted that the statistical error in these measurements is unknown and variations of ±15 hardness units are typical. In contrast, APS coatings of CrFeCoNiMo HEA doped with nano-oxides achieved a hardness of 319 ± 10 HV 0.1 , as reported by Mu et al. (Ref 65). In both the cases, the hardness of these HEA coatings was higher compared to CrFeCoNiMo 0. In summary: Among all TS processes used to fabricate HEA coatings, HEAs sprayed with HVOF achieved the highest average hardness: 789 ± 54 HV 0.1 , in the case of atomized Al 0.6 TiCrFeCoNi HEA feedstock, as depicted in Fig. 14. Numerous reports on the mechanical behavior of bulk HEAs attribute their outstanding properties to strains arising from 'lattice distortion,' one of the four core effects thought to govern the behavior of HEAs. However, recent reports have found that the strains arising from the 'mismatched' lattice are not significantly different from those experienced by traditional solid solution alloys (Ref 35). Thus, it is more appropriate to attribute the observed high hardness and strength values to supersaturated solid 2 summarizes the hardness and the possible strengthening mechanisms operating in TS-HEA coatings.

In summary: Among all TS processes used to fabricate HEA coatings, HEAs sprayed with HVOF achieved the highest average hardness: 789 ± 54 HV 0.1 , in the case of atomized Al 0.6 TiCrFeCoNi HEA feedstock, as depicted in Fig. 14. Numerous reports on the mechanical behavior of bulk HEAs attribute their outstanding properties to strains arising from 'lattice distortion,' one of the four core effects thought to govern the behavior of HEAs. However, recent reports have found that the strains arising from the 'mismatched' lattice are not significantly different from those experienced by traditional solid solution alloys (Ref 35). Thus, it is more appropriate to attribute the observed high hardness and strength values to supersaturated solid 2 summarizes the hardness and the possible strengthening mechanisms operating in TS-HEA coatings. Both properties are observed to depend strongly on the processing route of the feedstock, HEA composition, and TS route.</p>
        <p>High-temperature TS processes invariably result in supersaturated solid solutions, while intermediate cooling rates and/or process temperatures allow fine second-phase precipitation to occur. Low-temperature TS processes on the other hand rely on substantial plastic deformation of particles, resulting in grain refinement, to improve the mechanical properties of coatings. There is further latitude for tuning these properties by post-coating thermal treatments. Combining these process tools with the extensive scope of applying physical metallurgy concepts to the HEA materials hyperspace, such as tuning the microstructure to allow strain hardening to occur due to load-induced phase transformations, e.g., TWIP/TRIP effects, opens technological potential for the future of TS-HEA coatings.High-temperature TS processes invariably result in supersaturated solid solutions, while intermediate cooling rates and/or process temperatures allow fine second-phase precipitation to occur.

        <p>Tribological assessment of APS AlTiCrFeCoNi coating was conducted by Tian et al. (Ref 70) at 25, 500, 700 and 900 °C against Si 3 N 4 balls at a load of 5 N for a duration of 20 min. Tests at room temperature resulted in a volume wear rate of 0.77 ± 0.01 9 10 -4 mm 3 /N-m, much lower than 316 stainless steel (2.55 ± 0.31 9 10 -4 mm 3 /N-m). On the other hand, at 500 °C, the volume wear rate increased to 0.93 ± 0.02 9 10 -4 mm 3 /N-m due to a hardness decrease and operation of a more severe adhesive wear mechanism than at room temperature. Major adhesive wear with minor abrasive wear were indicated as the prevalent mechanisms from the wear surface morphology. Also, the wear surface was observed to have oxidized slightly at 500 °C compared to that at 25 °C. Wear volume rate at 700 °C was measured as 0.23 ± 0.02 9 10 -4 mm 3 / N-m, which increased further at 900 °C. The wear mechanisms at both temperatures were tribo-oxidation wear and abrasion wear. In summary, APS AlTiCrFeCoNi HEA coating exhibited excellent wear resistance at 700 °C compared to stainless steel due to the development of tribofilms and the formation of a hard and brittle r-CrFe precipitate phase during high-temperature wear testing.Tribological assessment of APS AlTiCrFeCoNi coating was conducted by Tian et al.

Coatings obtained using atomized feedstock exhibited the highest wear resistance in both the ball-on-disk and oscillating wear tests owing to the homogenous microstructure and higher hardness of GA-APS coatings. In contrast, the coating deposited using MA powder performed better in scratch testing compared to blended and atomized powder. Lobel et al.

The wear behavior of the coating was examined using a pin-on-disk tribometer at room temperature (RT), 300 and 500 °C. The measured wear rates were 1.044 9 10 -4 , 2.757 9 10 -4 , and 2.674 9 10 -4 mm 3 /N-m at RT, 300, and 500 °C, respectively. Morphological analysis of wear tracks depicted that both abrasion and fatigue wear contributed to coating wear. However, severity of both wear mechanisms increased with an increase in test temperature. Moreover, the difference between wear rates at 300 and 500 °C was not significantly high due to the formation of an oxide layer on the wear track at 500 °C. XRD analysis revealed that no phase changes occurred after friction testing at different temperatures, and the coating exhibits the BCC phase, i.e., the same as in the as-sprayed state. The fracture toughness of the as-sprayed coating obtained was 8.4 MPa m 1/2 , which further decreased to 5 MPa m 1/2 post-heat treatment at 800 °C due to the precipitation of r-CrFe phase, signifying increased coating brittleness due to heat treatment.Chen et al.

The volume wear rate of as-sprayed coatings had a decreasing trend with an increase in aluminum content from 0.5 to 1.5 under dry sliding conditions.

(Ref 74). The wear rate decreases significantly to 6.7 9 10 -6 mm 3 /N-m for the Al 1.0- SiCrFeCoNi coating after heat treatment due to the formation of BCC and Cr 3 Ni 5 Si 2 phases. SEM analysis of the wear surface displayed the formation of grooves, micropits due to spalling of splats, and micro-cracks at the interface of splats, which all suggest abrasive wear as the main wear mechanism. In contrast, the wear rate under water sliding conditions was lower than under dry sliding conditions due to lubricating as well as cooling effects promoted by the water media. However, the addition of aluminum to HEA and heat treatment had little influence on wear rate under these conditions as opposed to dry sliding conditions. The reinforced coating exhibited a lower volume wear rate in comparison with the AlTiCrFeCoNi coating (Ref 70), at both 25 and 500 °C testing conditions. Solution hardening in c-Ni and dispersion strengthening of hard interstitial compounds were attributed to better wear behavior of this coating.

The HEA-Ag composite coating exhibited a lower friction coefficient than the HEA coating at 25-400 °C due to the lubrication effect of silver. However, at high temperature (600 and 750 °C), the silver lubrication effect seems negligible since the wear mechanism changes to adhesion and oxidative wear, leading to a further decrease in the friction coefficient for both coatings. The wear rates obtained for HEA-Ag and HEA coatings at 25 °C were 0.8 9 10 -5 and 4 9 10 -5 mm 3 /N-m, and at 750 °C were 8.9 9 10 -6 and 3.3 9 10 -5 mm 3 /N-m, respectively, which were much lower than for both SKH51 (C = 0.80-0. ; all in wt.%) at a load of 10 N.

The superior wear resistance of APS coating was due to the lubrication effect created by the formation of an oxide layer during wear.

        <p>Corrosion protection to the advanced engineering materials, especially under highly aggressive environments, such as marine applications and chemical processing industries, is generally furnished by a coating system with superior electrochemical performance. Coatings with high corrosion resistance under different environments act as a barrier to the engineering component, and enhance the component lifetime. Thermal sprayed HEA coatings are not yet widely investigated with respect to their corrosive behavior in comparison with their laser clad and cast counterparts (Ref 105-109). Two reports have been published concerning of the corrosion behavior of HEA coatings formed by a thermal spray process (Ref 68,80). Wang et al.

Polarization curve analysis showed that (CrFeCoNi) 95 Nb 5 HEA coatings possessed a higher corrosion potential (-0.37 V) and lower current density (7.23 9 10 -6 A/cm 2 ) compared to other similar HEA systems, thus representing better corrosion resistance. SEM analysis of coating after electrochemical treatment indicated that selective corrosion occurred, with the formation of tiny dish-shaped pits and large pits on the coating surface. The interdendritic phases rich in Nb and Cr were more susceptible to corrosion compared to the Co-, Ni-, and Fe-rich dendritic phase. Formation of stable oxides such as Cr 2 O 3 and Nb 2 O 5 in the passivation film promoted the corrosion resistance of the coating, as detected by XPS analysis.Corrosion protection to the advanced engineering materials, especially under highly aggressive environments, such as marine applications and chemical processing industries, is generally furnished by a coating system with superior electrochemical performance.

Two reports have been published concerning of the corrosion behavior of HEA coatings formed by a thermal spray process (Ref 68,80). Wang et al. (Ref 80) examined the corrosive behavior of vacuum-plasma-sprayed (CrFeCoNi) 95 Nb 5 HEA coatings in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. Polarization curve analysis showed that (CrFeCoNi) 95 Nb 5 HEA coatings possessed a higher corrosion potential (-0.37 V) and lower current density (7.23 9 10 -6 A/cm 2 ) compared to other similar HEA systems, thus representing better corrosion resistance. SEM analysis of coating after electrochemical treatment indicated that selective corrosion occurred, with the formation of tiny dish-shaped pits and large pits on the coating surface. The interdendritic phases rich in Nb and Cr were more susceptible to corrosion compared to the Co-, Ni-, and Fe-rich dendritic phase. Formation of stable oxides such as Cr 2 O 3 and Nb 2 O 5 in the passivation film promoted the corrosion resistance of the coating, as detected by XPS analysis.</p>
        <p>The second report by Vallimanalan et al. (Ref 68) analyzed the corrosion behavior of HVOF-sprayed AlCrCo-NiMo HEA coatings and compared it with a conventional NiCrSiB-based HVOF coating. Corrosion rate calculation using a Tafel plot suggested that the HEA coating demonstrated a lower corrosion rate (0.00276 mm/year) compared to NiCrSiB coating (0.018 mm/year), thus concluding higher corrosion resistance for this particular HEA coating.The second report by Vallimanalan et al.

        <p>A prime example is thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) on superalloy blades in turbines. Superalloys have evolved through several generations and exhibit excellent creep properties and oxidation resistance under extreme harsh environments. However, oxidation resistance comes at the expense of creep performance. Thus, rather than compromising the superalloy creep resistance by adjusting compositions to benefit thermal stability, a suitable TBC can be designed to mitigate the oxidation and thermal resistance. The outcome is that the turbine blade lasts longer with lower maintenance. The coating is sacrificial in nature and can be stripped and replaced periodically, which is much more economical than replacing the superalloy blade.A prime example is thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) on superalloy blades in turbines.

        <p>In addition to traditional industries, there is also scope in the renewable energy sector, for example in wind energy where turbine blades need abrasion resistance from dust and hail, as well as being lightweight yet strong-an ideal case for coatings. Wear resistance HEA coatings have been a focus of the TS HEA community, as is detailed in ''Tribological Assessment'' section. The AlCrFeCoNiX family exhibits good wear resistance at room and elevated temperatures, relying on solid solution strengthening and, in some cases, precipitation hardening and operating via oxidative wear mechanisms. On the other end of the HEA spectrum, refractory HEAs (RHEAs) have excellent wear and abrasion resistance in cast and laser clad forms (Ref 111, 112), though they have not been fully exploited by TS manufacturing methods.In addition to traditional industries, there is also scope in the renewable energy sector, for example in wind energy where turbine blades need abrasion resistance from dust and hail, as well as being lightweight yet strong-an ideal case for coatings.

        <p>There is also scope for generating metal matrix composites as illustrated by Mu et al. (Ref 65), where ceramic particles are incorporated into a metallic binder. Other variants, such as replacing metallic binders with ductile FCC HEAs (i.e., the CrFeCoNi alloy family), and the ceramic with B2 phase or refractory HEAs, may be viable. Precedent exists from Zhu et al. (Ref 113) in the form of Ti(C,N) cermets using FCC AlCrFeCoNi alloy as binders, which exhibited better oxidation resistance than conventional materials. It is also possible to adjust spray parameters to generate highentropy ceramics in situ for wear resistance applications. Extensive literature on thin-film HEA-C/N/B/O compositions exists (Ref 31); therefore, there is similar potential to develop thick coatings via TS processes.There is also scope for generating metal matrix composites as illustrated by Mu et al.

        <p>As detailed in ''Oxidation Behavior'' section, there has been a focus on exploring HEAs as alternatives to MCrAlY bond coat materials (Ref 10). Compositions with varying quantities of Al, Cr, Si, Ti, and Ni have shown promising results. Besides bond coats, oxidation resistance is required at lower temperatures (\ 700 °C) in power generation industries, where Fe and Cr would be the primary oxidation-resistant elements. Furthermore, RHEAs, which are known to be limited by poor oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures, can be tuned with the addition of Al, Ti, etc., as evidenced by reports on cast RHEAs (Ref 114,115). Processing these coatings by vacuum plasma spray (VPS) or controlled atmospheric plasma spray (CAPS) is recommended to avoid IFO while promoting particle melting and splat formation.As detailed in ''Oxidation Behavior'' section, there has been a focus on exploring HEAs as alternatives to MCrAlY bond coat materials (Ref 10).

        <p>Protection from corrosion is an important and viable area for application of TS HEA coatings. Practically, all areas of industry operating in non-ambient conditions require some form of corrosion resistance. The market for thermal sprayed corrosion-resistant coatings is extremely large: from oil and gas/petroleum industries, chemical and metal processing industries, to marine environments-offshore oil rigs, naval applications in ships and submarines; and from food processing industries to powder generationhydro, thermal, geothermal, and land-based turbines. Each industry has specific stringent working environments for which TS HEA coatings can be tailored. Whereas there is a growing body of work on the corrosion behavior of TS HEA coatings, there is a rich body of literature exploring and proving the promise of corrosion-resistant HEAs in the cast or laser clad form (Ref 22,91). These compositions can be adopted by appropriate TS methods where it will be necessary to optimize the coating thickness and density for optimum performance.Protection from corrosion is an important and viable area for application of TS HEA coatings.

For example, Alagarsamy et ) also studied the AlCrFeCoNi/epoxy system, focusing on the effect of different powder morphologies and sizes on the EM absorption properties. They conclude that finer (0.2-7 lm) wet milled HEA exhibited higher total shielding due to enhancement of absorption, vis a `vis larger flaky alloy particles, and are excellent candidates for microwave shielding applications. This nature of HEA particles can be translated to TS coatings by low-temperature cold spray processes.Developing biocompatible HEAs for drug delivery and other related applications is a major focus of the HEA research community.

        <p>1. Most HEAs in the surface engineering field are processed through cladding and vapor deposition techniques. However, there is a growing market for thick HEA coatings. APS and HVOF are the major thermal spray techniques used for generating HEA coatings, with fewer reports on WS and CS. 2. HEA feedstock containing Al, Si, and/or Ti with a base of CrFeCoNi has been the major research interest since the focused application area is for performance at high temperatures. 3. Development of HEA feedstocks has unique implications on the TS coating microstructure and properties. Gas atomization (GA) is the leading processing route for HEA feedstocks. Blending, mechanical alloying (MA), arc melting followed by mechanical milling (AM-MM) are the other major HEA feedstock synthesis routes. While gas atomization delivers the widest particle size range, mechanical alloying results in a finer particle size of nanocrystalline character. 4. The microstructural advancement of the APS, HVOF, WS, and CS HEA coatings is described in conjunction with their phase composition development. As reported, thermal sprayed HEA coating microstructures are composed of one or more solid solution phases. In some cases, mainly APS, oxides are also reported. The prime feature of the TSC is a lamellar microstructure with development of complementary phases that are revealed by atomic number contrasts. 5. Mechanical behavior of the thermal sprayed coatings in terms of porosity, hardness and wear, along with oxidation resistance, is discussed. HVOF HEA coatings, with their dense microstructure, achieved the highest hardness. However, in most cases the hardness and wear resistance were superior to conventional materials due to the development of supersaturated multicomponent phases and different strengthening mechanisms. Excellent oxidation resistance of the thermal sprayed HEA coatings has displayed potential in replacing conventional bond coat materials. 6. The major focus of the thermal sprayed HEA coatings has been to develop wear-and oxidation-resistant coatings, especially for high-temperature applications.1.

        <p>One of the major proponents of surface engineering is its ability to elevate the lifetime of an inferior part using a high-performance surface coating. High-entropy alloys are a recent addition to this field, with the potential to replace several traditional coating materials on the basis of their excellent properties. To this end, selection of elements and the proportion in which to alloy them is of great importance. Although HEAs were initially defined as equiatomic alloys exhibiting single solid solution phases, recent literature has evidenced superior strength-ductility properties derived from multi-phase non-equiatomic compositions. TS-HEAs have followed a similar developmental path, for example, incorporating post-processing treatment to enhance wear properties of the coating.One of the major proponents of surface engineering is its ability to elevate the lifetime of an inferior part using a high-performance surface coating.

        <p>The most commonly used base elements that confer high operational performance and phase stability consist of Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mo and Ni, of which Co, Mo, and Ni are considered as strategic materials that are not only regulated by government policies but are expensive raw materials. The advantage of the thermal spray manufacturing route is that only a coating of 50-300 lm thickness is required, thus saving the need for expensive feedstocks. Likewise, experimenting with additional principal or trace elements, for example Ti and W, reduces quantities of these costly elements to achieve performance.The most commonly used base elements that confer high operational performance and phase stability consist of Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mo and Ni, of which Co, Mo, and Ni are considered as strategic materials that are not only regulated by government policies but are expensive raw materials.

Ranganathan (Emeritus Professor &amp; Senior Homi Bhabha Fellow, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India) whose article titled 'Alloyed pleasure: Multimetallic cocktails' (Current Science, 2003, 85 (10), 1404-1407, 267 citations) has been inspiring. The authors are grateful for his leadership and mentoring in physical metallurgy that has spanned five decades. We dedicate this review to Prof. S. Ranganathan.Historical Perspective and Dedication This manuscript has been finalized over a critical point in our history as we recover from a global pandemic.
