        <p>It is a key element in most of the biomolecules essential to life and is obviously present in the mantle of Earth. Much of our knowledge relating to nitrogen in the mantle come from analysis of natural diamonds. Most of these diamonds are formed at pressures and temperatures in the respective ranges of 5.5-8.0 GPa and 1000-1400°C, corresponding to depths of 140-240 km but some so-called 'super-deep' diamonds are deduced to have originated at much greater depths in the lower mantle 1,2 as illustrated in Figure 1. All natural diamonds contain some nitrogen impurity. 3 The traditional classification of natural diamonds into types I and II is based on their nitrogen content: Type I samples typically contain hundreds if not thousands of parts per million (ppm) of nitrogen, which will often impart a visible coloration to the diamond and can be characterised (and quantified) by infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Type II diamonds, in contrast, were originally categorized on the basis that they contain too little nitrogen (typically just a few ppm or less) for its presence to be detected by IR absorption. Both types are further sub-divided according to how the nitrogen is distributed and the extent, or otherwise, of any boron impurityas illustrated in Figure 2. Various IR-active N-related defects have long been recognised, [4][5][6][7] and absorption coefficients estimated to allow quantification of the amount of nitrogen accommodated in such defects and studies of their interconversion under thermal processing. 8,9 Such defects were historically labelled alphabetically. Examples include: C-centres, wherein a single carbon atom in the diamond lattice has been substituted by a nitrogen atom, A-centres (pairs of substitutional nitrogen atoms) and B-centresdefects comprising four N atoms around a vacancy. A vacancy (henceforth often denoted as V) corresponds to a lattice site from which the carbon is missing.It is a key element in most of the biomolecules essential to life and is obviously present in the mantle of Earth.

        <p>Most (~98%) natural diamonds are type I. Of these, most are classified as type Ia and have a pale yellow or brown colour attributable to aggregations of nitrogen atoms within the carbon lattice (see Figure 3). These nitrogen atoms often co-exist with hydrogen impurities. As Figure 2 showed, type Ia diamonds are often further sub-divided in types IaA, IaB (and even IaAB) reflecting the majority way in which the nitrogen is aggregated. Type Ib stones are much rarer. They also contain substantial nitrogen, but the nitrogen atoms are more widely dispersed throughout the sample. Type Ib diamonds tend to display a wider range of (often more intense) coloursthat reflect the distribution of nitrogen impurities. Type IIa diamonds are considered the 'purest of the pure'. They contain very low levels of impurity and are transparent throughout the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectral regions down to wavelengths ~230 nmthus appearing colourless. Many of the most famous large diamonds (e.g. the Cullinan, Koh-i-Noor and Lesedi La Rona diamonds) are type IIa. Type IIb diamonds also have very low nitrogen content but, as illustrated in Figure 4, often generally appear light blue or grey due to the presence of trace quantities of atomic boron substituted within the lattice. The Hope diamond is a famous example of a type IIb diamond, which are rare in nature.Most (~98%) natural diamonds are type I.

        <p>Access to (and study of) type II material has been greatly boosted by the development of rival laboratory-based methods of synthesizing diamond described in Section 2. Many 'nitrogen in diamond' issues continue to exercise the scientific community. For example, the empirical models used by geochemists to trace the behaviour of nitrogen in the Earth's mantle draw disproportionately on analysis of diamond samplesin which nitrogen is the most common and abundant lattice-bound impurity. The analysis is challenging, in part because many of the available samples display multiple growth zones, which likely developed at different times and in different environments (i.e. in different molten fluids and at different temperatures (T) and pressures (p)). But other fundamental questions also remain, not least how single nitrogen atoms arrive at substitutional sites in the carbon lattice. The substantial nitrogen content in type I diamonds encourages the view that nitrogen is 'compatible' in diamond (since nitrogen and carbon have similar atomic sizes and valence shells), but such a statement masks a wealth of complexity. Atomic nitrogen may be compatible in diamond, but molecular nitrogen, ammonium ions and/or metallic nitrides (i.e. the forms in which nitrogen is most likely to be present in the Earth's mantle 11 ) are not. Thus, there remains a pressing need to understand better how the prevailing p, T and composition affect the speciation of nitrogen under a range of mantle conditions relevant to diamond formation, and then to understand how that information is encoded in the natural diamonds that are available for analysis. For example, there is growing recognition that many of the highest quality type II diamonds originate from the highly reducing deep mantle, 12 where the pressure and temperature are both more extreme.Access to (and study of) type II material has been greatly boosted by the development of rival laboratory-based methods of synthesizing diamond described in Section 2.

        <p>What is less clear, however, is whether the low N content in such diamonds implies low nitrogen abundance in that region of the mantle or whether the fluid from which such diamonds grew disfavours reactions that release monatomic nitrogen. The reliability of diamond as a reporter of nitrogen abundance in the mantle is thus now under renewed scrutiny. 3 The remainder of this Review is structured as follows. We introduce the more popular laboratory-based synthesis routes that now complement nature as a source of diamond. Highpressure high-temperature (HPHT) and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) methods both offer opportunities for investigating single-crystal diamond (SCD) growth under conditions that are much better defined and controlled than in nature. Nano-sized diamond particles were first produced by detonation methods, 13 but the range of potential applications perceived for this material has encouraged alternative synthetic routes; these are also summarised in Section 2.What is less clear, however, is whether the low N content in such diamonds implies low nitrogen abundance in that region of the mantle or whether the fluid from which such diamonds grew disfavours reactions that release monatomic nitrogen.

        <p>The properties and the potential applications of diamond produced by all of these methods can be altered/expanded by strategic introduction of dopant atoms, and this too is discussed in Section 2, focusing particularly on doping with nitrogen. Section 3 surveys many of the methods used to reveal and characterize the presence of nitrogen in diamond, and some of the exquisite details about N-containing defects that have now being gleaned from combinations of theory and spectroscopic analyses of diamonds synthesized under well-defined and controlled laboratory conditions. We outline what such knowledge can tell us about how nitrogen is incorporated in both HPHT and CVD material, and how the presence of nitrogen affects some of the key properties and characteristics of diamond.

        <p>2.1 High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) Methods.2.1 High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) Methods.</p>
        <p>Nature was the inspiration for the HPHT method, by which diamond growth was demonstrated by Swedish company ASEA in 1953 (though not reported at that time) and subsequently by US company General Electric in 1955. 14 , 15 Most present-day HPHT synthesis exploits the temperature-gradient growth (TGG) method developed later in that decade. 16 However, it took many further years before the design and control of HPHT reactors yielded diamonds of sufficient size and quality to attract much attention from the jewellery industry. [17][18]19 Key ingredients for HPHT growth are a carbon source (typically graphite or diamond powder) together with a metal catalyst (e.g. a Fe-Ni or Fe-Ni-Co alloy) that allows diamond formation at lower temperature. These ingredients are placed in a carefully designed reactor chamber such as that illustrated in Figure 5 to facilitate diamond growth on a diamond seed at pressures of 5-6 GPa and temperatures in the range 1300-1600°Ci.e. just on the diamond side of the Berman-Simon line 20 in the carbon phase diagram (Figure 6). Maintaining the carbon source at a slightly higher temperature than the seed ensures net diffusion of carbon atoms through the molten flux and formation of a synthetic diamond crystal on the seed. Early HPHT diamonds were coloured, due to impurities (e.g. N, B or transition metals from the catalyst used) in the growth system. The resulting 'industrial' diamonds were too unsightly for gemstone use but ideal for cutting or grinding applications. Nowadays, however, contamination levels can be controlled such that it is possible to grow several colourless gemstone-quality HPHT synthetics simultaneously within the press. where HPHT and CVD synthesis can occur. Note that CVD is a non-equilibrium process, and that the region illustrating CVD growth has been exaggerated for clarity.

        <p>Such improvements in process control have led to similarly impressive advances in our knowledge and understanding of the effects that nitrogen impurities in the metal melts have on the growth, the morphology and the defect and impurity structure in diamonds grown by HPHT methods. 22 For example, HPHT diamonds with minimal nitrogen content can be grown by adding aluminium or titanium powder to getter the nitrogen in the starting materials. The Ncontent in the growth medium (and in the resulting HPHT diamond) can then be increased (and controlled) by judicious addition of a suitable nitride (e.g. NaN3 or P3N5), 23 or a substance like melamine (C3N6H6) if N-H containing defects are the target for study. 24 Pre-existing diamonds (natural or synthetic) can also be subject to further treatment by HPHT methods. One such recent study 25 has shown that appropriate annealing of HPHT-grown, N-H co-doped SCDs with N content of ~1000 ppm encourages aggregation of the nitrogen atoms (from C-centres to A-and B-centres). Such annealing reduces the visible coloration of these samples, especially in the {111} facesthereby increasing their potential appeal and value. The IR absorption signatures of the post-annealed samples are also more akin to those of 'natural' type Ia and Ib diamonds. Further careful studies of the aggregation mechanism and the mutual interaction of nitrogen and hydrogen (section 3.5) should advance our understanding of how natural diamonds are formed, and of ways in which they can be reliably distinguished from lab-grown diamonds.Such improvements in process control have led to similarly impressive advances in our knowledge and understanding of the effects that nitrogen impurities in the metal melts have on the growth, the morphology and the defect and impurity structure in diamonds grown by HPHT methods. 22 For example, HPHT diamonds with minimal nitrogen content can be grown by adding aluminium or titanium powder to getter the nitrogen in the starting materials.

        <p>(i.e. below 0.1 MPa). This is a non-equilibrium growth process. Almost inevitably, it favours incorporation of different defects. Attempts at diamond CVD can also be traced back to the over half a century 26,27 but the first deposition protocols that yielded diamond of reasonable quality at technologically relevant deposition rates only appeared in the early 1980's. [28][29][30] The diamond CVD process has been extensively reviewed elsewhere, [31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38] and is thus only summarised here. The carbon source is usually methane, diluted (to just a few % input mole fraction) in hydrogen. The gas mixture in most high-quality CVD diamond applications is activated using a microwave (MW) plasma in a specially designed reactor such as that shown schematically in Figure 7. waveguide and an antenna. The chamber forms a resonant cavity that is tuned by moving the antenna position. The MW power generates a plasma situated just above the substrate surface which activates, ionises and dissociates the input gases, initiating diamond growth on the nearby substrate.

        <p>They participate in gas-phase reactions with the source hydrocarbon, creating a complex mixture of hydrocarbon species including carbon-containing radicals. The H atoms also participate in abstraction and addition reactions with carbon atoms on the surface of the growing diamond film. This dynamic equilibrium ensures that most surface atoms at any time are stabilized by terminating C-H bonds, which prevent the surface reconstructing to graphitic carbon. But it also ensures that some fraction (typically a few %) will have an unsatisfied valence (often termed a 'dangling' bond) by which an incident carbon-containing radical can be accommodated and thereby grow the diamond lattice. The gas-phase H atoms also preferentially etch any carbonaceous material that deposits in non-diamond form and the recombination of H atoms on any surface contributes to heating of that surface.They participate in gas-phase reactions with the source hydrocarbon, creating a complex mixture of hydrocarbon species including carbon-containing radicals.

        <p>Key features of the gas and gas-surface chemistry that enable diamond CVD from MWactivated CH4/H2 input gas mixtures are now summarised in order to paint a background for the later discussion of the effects of adding N2 to the process gas mixture. Illustrative process conditions are 1-10 kW input MW power (P) and total gas pressures (p) in the range 100-300 Torr. MW power absorption accelerates electrons (e) in the gas, and the frequency of e-H2 collisions at the prevailing pressures ensures that this absorbed energy is efficiently transformed into rotational and, particularly, vibrational excitation of H2. The core of the plasma is characterized by a low (ppm) degree of ionization but a high gas temperature (Tgas ~3000 K, or higher). This ensures thermal dissociation of several percent of the H2 in the hot plasma region to H atoms, which diffuse throughout the reactor and drive the chemistry.Key features of the gas and gas-surface chemistry that enable diamond CVD from MWactivated CH4/H2 input gas mixtures are now summarised in order to paint a background for the later discussion of the effects of adding N2 to the process gas mixture.

Various constraints limit the choice of substrate material.

        <p>Many transition metals satisfy this criterion, but most are ruled out by their excessive reactivity with carbon-containing species. Molybdenum and, particularly, silicon are popular substrate materials. 41 Both develop a thin interfacial carbide layer at the start of the growth process that helps reduce stresses from lattice mismatch and differences in thermal expansion coefficient, but some form of pre-treatment is still normally required to encourage diamond nucleation.Many transition metals satisfy this criterion, but most are ruled out by their excessive reactivity with carbon-containing species.

        <p>This can involve abrading the substrate with fine diamond dust (manually or, better, by ultrasonic agitation), or coating the substrate surface with a suspension of nanosized diamond particles prior to positioning it in the growth chamber. Both strategies can be applied to localised areas only, and thus offer routes to selected area deposition. Bias-enhanced nucleation (BEN) is another strategyparticularly compatible with MW reactorswhereby the substrate is initially negatively biased to encourage bombardment and implantation by carbon-containing ions in the plasma prior to switching to normal plasma-assisted growth. 42,43 Diamond growth on a non-diamond substrate starts from numerous nucleation sites. The individual nuclei grow (both axially and radially) and progressively fuse with their immediate neighbours to form a two-dimensional film that then continues to grow along the surface normal. The resulting material will usually be polycrystalline, but its morphology and the average crystallite size can be tunedfrom microcrystalline diamond (MCD), through nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) 44 to ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) 45,46 by choosing the appropriate process conditions. 47 Smaller grain sizes are favoured by increasing the renucleation rate on the growing sample, which can be achieved by raising the C:H ratio in the source gas mixture and, in the case of UNCD, by substituting most of the input hydrogen by argon.This can involve abrading the substrate with fine diamond dust (manually or, better, by ultrasonic agitation), or coating the substrate surface with a suspension of nanosized diamond particles prior to positioning it in the growth chamber.

        <p>CVD diamond materials present two principal low-index surfaces: the C(111) and C (100) surfaces. The relative (and the absolute) growth rates on these surfaces are also sensitive to factors like the C:H ratio in the source gas and Tsub. As illustrated by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images shown in Figure 8(a)-(c), it is possible to tune the morphology of as-grown MCD films from 'rough' (i.e. dominated by {111} facets) to much smoother in the case of a &lt;100&gt;-textured, {100}-faceted film. 48,49 The inevitable grain boundaries introduce variability and restrict the ultimate potential of all forms of polycrystalline diamond, though not to the extent to preclude its use in an ever-growing range of demanding applications (e.g. heat spreaders, IR and MW windows, wear resistant coatings, etc). Turning now to single-crystal diamond (SCD), there are currently two favoured approaches to synthesising larger area SCD by CVD methods. 50 One involves homoepitaxial growth on a preexisting SCD substrate, resulting in axial (but minimal transverse) enlargement of the crystal.CVD diamond materials present two principal low-index surfaces: the C(111) and C (100) surfaces.

        <p>A subtle variation of this is CVD overgrowth of natural gemstones to make them larger and therefore, of higher value; these 'hybrids' can be deceiving as they contain spectroscopic signatures from both natural and synthetic diamond. 51 Such homoepitaxial growth is the driving force behind the burgeoning market in CVD diamond gemstones for the jewellery market, and is enabling fabrication of colourless diamonds approaching cm in size. 52 These recent developments are a direct result of improvements in the technology underlying CVDnotably, higher power MW reactors that enable increased gas dissociation in the plasma (and hence higher growth rates), and improved process management that allows the growth conditions to be precisely controlled and maintained for many days.A subtle variation of this is CVD overgrowth of natural gemstones to make them larger and therefore, of higher value; these 'hybrids' can be deceiving as they contain spectroscopic signatures from both natural and synthetic diamond. 51 Such homoepitaxial growth is the driving force behind the burgeoning market in CVD diamond gemstones for the jewellery market, and is enabling fabrication of colourless diamonds approaching cm in size. 52 These recent developments are a direct result of improvements in the technology underlying CVDnotably, higher power MW reactors that enable increased gas dissociation in the plasma (and hence higher growth rates), and improved process management that allows the growth conditions to be precisely controlled and maintained for many days.</p>

The constraints on this substrate material are considerable. In addition to being able to withstand the harsh growth conditions, it must also have appropriate lattice parameters and be available with high quality crystallinity. Iridium is the current substrate of choice, in thin film form (given its scarcity and expense) on, for example, an yttria-stabilized zirconia layer on a Si substrate, and diamond growth is encouraged by an initial BEN stage. 55,56Cloning (i.e. using a laser to slice off sections from the enlarged crystal) and then carefully positioning the resulting 'tiles' prior to further homoepitaxial overgrowth offers a means of increasing the lateral size to fabricate larger area 'wafers' of diamond. 53,54 The other approach involves heteroepitaxial growth of diamond on another substrate material that is already available in large-area form.

First, [CN]ns is typically less than [N]ns, though this imbalance is reduced when operating at higher pressures and/or MW powers. Second, a chemisorbed CN species must undergo a further gas-surface reaction step (an H atom addition) in order to form a surface-bound CNH species (isoelectronic with CO) that is capable of promoting an energetically feasible ring-opening/ring-closing reaction sequence. Third, the N-H bond in the CNH adduct is weak, and the binding energy of the CNH adduct is itself quite low, so this species will be prone to thermal dissociation and/or desorption. 96 However, the possibility of incorporating a CNH species remains an intriguing prospect since, if the ring-closed structure is reached, this mechanism alone has the effect of adding two heavy atoms, with the N atom sitting one layer above that of the current growth layer and optimally positioned to nucleate next layer growth.

To produce diamond with useful semiconducting properties it is thus necessary to alter its conductivity by adding controlled amounts of impurities. In traditional semiconductor physics, adding an element with one fewer electron (an acceptor) than the bulk, e.g. boron in carbon, should produce p-type semiconducting material, whereas adding an element with one more electron (a donor) should produce n-type material. Having both p-and n-type material is necessary for forming p-n junctions and the operation of many electronic devices, such as CMOS transistors. Doping diamond with boron can be achieved simply by adding small amounts of boron-containing gases (e.g. B2H6 or B(CH3)3) to the gas mixture during the CVD diamond growth process. 110 This readily produces p-type boron-doped diamond (BDD) with conductivities ranging from semiconducting to near metallic, 111 and which can even become superconducting at temperatures &lt;10 K. 112 BDD is already finding application in simple electronic devices, 113 microplasma devices, 114 biomedicine 115 and in electrochemistry. [116][117]118,119 In contrast, doping diamond to achieve n-type semiconductivity has proven much more challenging. This is because, apart from nitrogen, all potential n-type dopant atoms have a larger atomic radius than carbon. These larger atoms cannot fit easily into the vacancy formed by removing a C atom from a lattice site. Unlike other semiconductor materials (e.g. Si and Ge) the rigid diamond lattice is less able to stretch to accommodate a larger atom in place of C. Most of the potential larger n-type dopant atoms (P, As, Na, Li) have a very low solid-state solubility in diamond, leading to dopant concentrations that are too small to be useful. 120 Nitrogen is different, in as much that it is a potential electron donor and has an atomic radius less than that of carbon. It incorporates into diamond relatively easilyas evidenced by the naturally occurring type I diamonds and the discoloration of diamonds formed in the early HPHT growth experiments. As shown in §2.2.3, adding small amounts of N2 or NH3 to a CVD gas mixture leads to some N incorporation into the diamond lattice. Unfortunately, the N tends to reside at substitutional sites (C-centres), whereat least in the neutral charge stateit distorts the surrounding diamond lattice due to the preferential formation of a lone-pair on the N atom and a dangling bond on one of its four carbon neighbours. The N still acts as an electron donor, but the distortion generates a donor level that is 1.7 eV below the valence band (see section 3). The energy required to promote an electron from this 'deep donor' band into the valence band is much greater than that available at normal semiconductor operating temperatures, with the result that N-doped diamond is ineffective as an n-type semiconductor.by atomistic simulations which assume addition of a gas-phase N atom to C (111) growing laterally in step-flow mode, 108 though it has also been suggested that a high alignment of NV defects along the [111] axis could be obtained by thermal annealing if the sample is under an appropriate biaxial compressive strain. 109 2.2.4 Doping CVD diamond films with nitrogen Intrinsic, or undoped, diamond is highly insulating.

        <p>UNCD, introduced in §2.2.1, is a hard, nanosmooth material that is deposited using a CVD process similar to that used for other forms of diamond, but with a much higher C:H ratio in the source gas. UNCD films consist of diamond crystallites &lt;10 nm in size surrounded by a matrix of enlarged grain boundaries composed of non-diamond sp 2 carbon that can constitute up to 10% of the volume of the film. The physical properties of UNCD are much reduced compared to those of larger grained diamond films but, when nitrogen-containing gases are added to the CVD growth mixture, the resulting films exhibit n-type semiconductivity and low resistivity. [129][130]131 Studies have shown that, in this case, the N is not substituting for C in the diamond lattice to act as an electron donor. Instead, the nitrogen atoms are concentrated within the extensive sp 2 grain boundary regions, increasing the thickness of these boundaries and forming conductive regions composed of amorphous carbon nitride or nitrogenated diamondlike carbon. Thus, this is not true n-type doping in the conventional sense, but N-UNCD (as it is known) nevertheless behaves as an n-type semiconductor and has found use in a number of electronic devices. 134 For convenience, diamond particles are usually categorised by size into three broad groups.UNCD, introduced in §2.2.1, is a hard, nanosmooth material that is deposited using a CVD process similar to that used for other forms of diamond, but with a much higher C:H ratio in the source gas.

        <p>The smallest of these diamond-particle size groups, diamondoids, are hydrocarbon cage molecules of size ~1-2 nm, in which the carbons all have tetrahedral sp 3 hybridization such that the structures are totally or at least largely superimposable on the cubic diamond lattice. 135 Adamantane (C10H16) is the smallest diamondoid molecule, but by fusing together different numbers of adamantane cage units in different arrangements, a family of structural and isomeric 'polymantanes' can be createdthe first few of which are illustrated in Figure 12.The smallest of these diamond-particle size groups, diamondoids, are hydrocarbon cage molecules of size ~1-2 nm, in which the carbons all have tetrahedral sp 3 hybridization such that the structures are totally or at least largely superimposable on the cubic diamond lattice. 135 Adamantane (C10H16) is the smallest diamondoid molecule, but by fusing together different numbers of adamantane cage units in different arrangements, a family of structural and isomeric 'polymantanes' can be createdthe first few of which are illustrated in Figure 12.</p>
        <p>The smaller diamondoids, comprising up to four adamantane cages (diamantane, triamantane and tetramantane), can be synthesised using traditional organic synthetic procedures, but the number of synthetic steps required to make larger diamondoids is prohibitively large. Another production involves extraction, filtration and purification of sediments found in petroleum deposits. Millimetre-sized pure crystals of a whole range of polymantane molecules, some comprising ten or more adamantane cages per molecule, have been obtained by this method. 136,137 Because diamondoid molecules are simply cage hydrocarbons with an external surface terminated with C-H bonds, it is relatively simply to functionalise the surface by replacing the H with other chemical groups, such as carbonyls, hydroxyls, amines or cyanides. 138 It follows that other molecules, such as proteins, catalysts, or even DNA strands, can then be grafted onto the functionalised surface via, for example, amide or ester links. This has opened up the use of diamondoid molecules for a range of applications, such as pharmaceuticals, catalysis, molecular electronics and biosensors for DNA sensing. 139The smaller diamondoids, comprising up to four adamantane cages (diamantane, triamantane and tetramantane), can be synthesised using traditional organic synthetic procedures, but the number of synthetic steps required to make larger diamondoids is prohibitively large.

        <p>As the number of conjoined cages increases, there comes a point where the diamondoid stops behaving like an individual molecule, but instead adopts the attributes and properties of a more macroscopic material or nanoparticle. As such, nanodiamond (ND) forms the second group of diamond particles, which typically have sizes 2-10 nm. 140 Various ND production methods have been demonstrated, 141 the most common of which is via detonation of oxygen-deficient explosives (such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (hexogen)) in a non-oxidizing medium (e.g. an inert atmosphere or in water or ice) inside a specially constructed steel detonation chamber. 142 No additional carbon material is required, since carbon is already present in the explosive. The incomplete combustion of the explosives in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere leads to the formation of elemental carbon (in various forms) along with CO, CO2, water and nitrogen. The detonation produces a shockwave, which propagates through the reaction mixture at supersonic speeds. The elementary carbon products will condense in the form that is thermodynamically stable at the prevailing temperature and pressure. In this case, the values in the transient shockwave can be p ~10-20 GPa and T ~ 2000-4000 Kunder which conditions diamond is the thermodynamically favoured phase of carbon. At all other times, the pressure and temperature conditions favour other forms of carbon. Thus, the explosion produces a mixture of diamond particles, soot and other sp 2 carbon material. The speed with which the gas cools after the shockwave, and hence the time for which the carbon is in the diamond and graphitic favoured regions of the p,T phase diagram (recall Figure 6), is controlled by the cooling properties of the surrounding mediumwhich controls the composition and yield of the diamond particles. 143 Because the high explosives used (TNT and hexogen) contain nitro groups, some of the nitrogen inevitably ends up either on the surface of the ND particles or encapsulated within them in substitutional lattice positions, 144,145 which is important for sensing applications (see Section 4.3).As the number of conjoined cages increases, there comes a point where the diamondoid stops behaving like an individual molecule, but instead adopts the attributes and properties of a more macroscopic material or nanoparticle.

        <p>The powdery mixture of products from the detonation is cleaned with various acids and reagents to remove unwanted metallic impurities and soot, and the sp 3 carbon component isolated. The resulting detonation nanodiamond (DND) is commercially available as a powder or as a suspension in water produced at a rate of several tons per year.

        <p>Each DND particle is encased by sp 2 carbonaceous material that binds the composite, 146 as illustrated in Figure 13. The as-supplied material thus usually requires de-aggregation into its constituent particles before subsequent processing. De-aggregation can be achieved in many ways, including ball milling, pulverisation, high-power sonication, acid treatments, controlled heating in O2 or H2, or combinations of these methods. 147 Even after such cleaning and deaggregation, however, the isolated DND particles are not simply larger versions of a perfect polymantane. This is because, as the size of the particle increases, the minimum energy structure is achieved by restructuring the surface carbon atoms to a more sp 2 -like arrangement.Each DND particle is encased by sp 2 carbonaceous material that binds the composite, 146 as illustrated in Figure 13.

        <p>DND particles are thus viewed as having a diamond core surrounded by a (partially) graphitic or fullerene-like shell -and are sometimes described as 'bucky-diamonds'. 148 Similar energy minimization arguments suggest that any N atoms present in DND particles will tend to concentrate at the surface. 149 As a result of the various acid treatments and cleaning processes applied following detonation synthesis, the surfaces of DND particles are usually terminated with oxygen containing groups like carboxyl, hydroxyl or bridging-ether groups. DND particles are thus hydrophilic, which helps their stability when in aqueous suspensions. This surface termination can be modified by standard chemical methods, 150 including direct C-C coupling by photochemical reaction, diazonium salt coupling, click chemistry and other routes illustrated in Figure 14. For instance, heating DND in H2 gives an H-terminated surface, which is mildly hydrophobic, 151 while treatment with F2 yields F-termination, which is superhydrophobic. 152 Amination (addition of NH2) of the nanodiamond surface is of particular interest because it enables the subsequent binding of a large variety of functional molecules, such as bioactive compounds (proteins, enzymes, DNA), catalysts, drug molecules, or polymer building blocks by amide bond formation or other standard chemical procedures. Adding nitrogen-containing surface groups to DND turns out to be harder than expected, however, with most direct amination reactions proving only partially successful. A better strategy is to establish the amino functions slightly removed from the diamond surface, via a linking moleculee.g. aminated silanes, 153 or Suzuki coupling of aminated aromatic species 154 or formation of aminomethyl groups. 155 Another approach is to form the amide bond using a highly carboxylated DND surface and a free amino group from the molecule to be tethered. In this way, even large proteins can be immobilised on the carboxylated DND surface via peptide bonds. The peptide link can be made in a single step, enabled by auxiliary reagents such as EEDQ (N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2dihydroquinoline) or a suitable carbodiimide. 142 Alternatively, thionyl chloride can be used in a two-step method to convert the surface carboxylic acid groups into their respective acid chlorides, which then react readily with any amine groups present in the linking molecule to form amide bonds. 156 Such surface functionalisation methods can, of course, be applied to larger (HPHT or CVD grown) diamond samples also, but have been most extensively and profitably applied to NDs with their large surface-to-volume ratios.DND particles are thus viewed as having a diamond core surrounded by a (partially) graphitic or fullerene-like shell -and are sometimes described as 'bucky-diamonds'. 148 Similar energy minimization arguments suggest that any N atoms present in DND particles will tend to concentrate at the surface. 149 As a result of the various acid treatments and cleaning processes applied following detonation synthesis, the surfaces of DND particles are usually terminated with oxygen containing groups like carboxyl, hydroxyl or bridging-ether groups.

        <p>During the collapse of the bubble, the entrained materials are subjected to a very high temperature and pressure spike, sufficient to momentarily raise the system into the diamondstable region of the carbon p, T phase diagram (see Figure 6).

Once viewed only as a low-yield process (10-40% of NDs in the reaction product with an average particle size of 5-15 nm 159 ), PLAL is now yielding sufficient amounts of monodispersed ND of sufficient purity and homogeneity to make it a commercially viable product. 160 One advantage of the PLAL method is that the composition of the ND can be altered simply by changing the target material or the liquid medium. Thus, magnetic NDs can be produced by incorporating magnetic metals (e.g. cobalt) into the graphite target, and N-containing NDs can be formed by replacing the aqueous medium with ammonia solution.

        <p>Ion implantation is widely used in the semiconductor industry to introduce dopants into a material with accurately controlled concentrations and depths in order to modify the electrical conductivity of the material. Doping diamond by ion implantation is more complicated than for many other materials, however, because of its tendency to graphitise when damaged. 162 The reason for this is self-evident from the carbon phase diagram (Figure 6): graphite is the thermodynamically stable form of carbon under normal conditions of p and T. By its very nature, ion implantation damages the diamond lattice, knocking C atoms from their lattice sites, creating vacancies and interstitials, and forcing impurity atoms (which may be larger than carbon) into the lattice. This damage can cause localised graphitisation, or a host of other defects such as vacancies, point defects and dislocations, and create significant lattice strain.Ion implantation is widely used in the semiconductor industry to introduce dopants into a material with accurately controlled concentrations and depths in order to modify the electrical conductivity of the material.

        <p>A further challenge with diamond is that the energy barriers to diffusion of many implanted impurities through the lattice are sufficiently high to ensure low diffusion probabilitieseven at elevated temperatures. Thus, impurities are resistant to moving to the substitutional sites required for electronic doping and annealing simply accelerates the graphitisation process or enables vacancies to cluster, forming extended defect regions. Some of this damage can be reduced if the implantation itself is performed at higher temperatures (&gt;800 K), which encourages instantaneous annealing around the damaged volume. Even so, the number of remaining extended defects and dislocations may still be sufficient to compromise electronic performance. 163 Implantation has been widely studied as a 'brute force' method to obtaining the elusive n-type doping of diamond (see §2.2.4), but the damage created, and subsequent graphitisation, has led to generally unfavourable results. 164 Nitrogen, being smaller than carbon, is actually rather easier to implant into diamond than most other atoms, and N-implantation generally causes less damage.

        <p>The optical signatures of different processes in diamond typically occur at different energies and have different linewidths. In vibrational spectroscopy, one-phonon IR absorption in defectfree diamond is forbidden due to the inversion-symmetric, homonuclear structure of the medium. The addition of point defects can destroy the local symmetry, however, enabling local one-phonon absorption. 173 The lattice cut-off for a single phonon in diamond is at a wavenumber of 1332 cm -1 (165 meV): vibrations at energies below this will propagate through the lattice and are typically broad, with linewidths &gt;40 cm -1 (5 meV). Vibrations with energies 1332 cm -1 , in contrast, are localised in both frequency and space, and will manifest as sharp spectral lines known as local vibrational modes (LVM), with typical linewidths ~3 cm -1 (~0.3 meV) as illustrated in Figure 15.

        <p>Electronic transitions in diamond occur at energies in the range from ~0.5 eV (4000 cm -1 ) up to the bandgap at 5.47 eV. 173 Typically, the spectrum of an electronic transition in diamond will display a sharp, purely electronic feature and a broad phonon-assisted sideband to higher energy in absorption, or to lower energy in luminescence. The purely electronic transition is termed a zero-phonon line (ZPL): typical linewidths are in the range 0.5-5 meV in ensemble measurements at low temperature (&lt;80 K) but can be lifetime-limited (~20 MHz, 60 μeV) in measurements of isolated single defect centres.

        <p>Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has also been pivotal in the identification and probing of point defects in diamond. EPR measures the absorption/emission of microwave radiation between different spin levels of unpaired electrons in a sample held in a magnetic field.

In contrast to EPR measurements of liquid samples, where the measured spectrum depends intimately on the concentration of the radical (amongst other things), the EPR spectra of point defects in diamond are essentially identical sample-to-sample, as in each case the defect is "frozen" in place and exists in the same environment.

        <p>Diamond in natural isotopic abundance is a dilute nuclear spin bath (only 1.1% of the atoms are 13 C, with a nuclear spin I = ½), which yields narrow resonance lines and enables highresolution paramagnetic spectroscopy. As noted in §2.2.3, CVD offers a route to essentially pure 12 C diamond. Such extreme nuclear-spin-dilute environments are a prerequisite for the superlative spin properties of several diamond defects. [202][203][204] There are many in-depth texts covering both the EPR technique, [205][206][207][208][209] and its specific application to diamond. [210][211][212][213][214] The power of EPR relies on the intimate relationship between the spin Hamiltonian parameters measured in an EPR spectrum, and the electronic, chemical and geometric structure of the defect. The spectrum of an EPR-active defect reflects its symmetry and orbital structure (via spin-orbit interactions), its chemical constituents (via electron-nuclear hyperfine, and nuclear quadrupole interactions), and spin-phonon coupling at the defect (via its spin relaxation properties). Identification of different chemical elements with similar nuclear spin generally relies on comparison of the spectrum with the natural abundance of different isotopes of each element. For example, nitrogen is a dominant impurity in diamond and is easily identified by its 99.6% abundant I = 1 14 N isotope. Where ambiguity exists, the synthesis of samples with isotopically enriched in the dopant of interest can be crucial to determining the elements involved, particularly in cases where the dominant isotope has I = 0 (as is the case for silicon and oxygen). Even once a dopant has been definitively identified, access to material containing only I = ½ isotopes (which removes additional spectral complexities associated with the nuclear quadrupole interaction) can be critical in understanding and fully interpreting the EPR spectrum.

        <p>Common treatments performed on diamond with a view to processing its composition include the introduction of elements through implantation, the introduction of lattice damage through particle irradiation (e.g. with electrons, neutrons, or gamma rays) and moderate-to-hightemperature annealing of the material. Annealing provides thermal energy required to break bonds within the material, thereby allowing elements, vacancies, or defect complexes to diffuse through the lattice.

        <p>To a good approximation, the electronic structure of the NnV family of defects can be described using the 'vacancy-cage' model. 283,284 This model assumes that the gross properties of a vacancy-type defect in diamond can be derived by considering only those electronic orbitals that 'point into' the vacancy. Since the radicals are unstable, the electronic states that result are localised on the defect and lie in the band gap. For the NnV family, therefore, the vacancy-cage model encourages us to focus on the symmetry (and valence) changes when up to four of the C atoms around a vacancy are substituted by N atoms.

        <p>The nitrogen vacancy centre, NV, comprises a single substitutional N atom adjacent to a vacant lattice site as shown in Figure 19(a), giving the defect a trigonal C3v symmetry. Three charge states of NV are known: +, 0 and -, with total ground-state spin S = 0, ½ and 1, respectively. 235,[285][286][287] NV defects have been subjected to huge recent attention owing to their potential applications in quantum computing, quantum communication and magnetometry (see Section 4). These applications stem from: the spin-dependent fluorescence of the NV -centre that are accessible below ~10 K; 289 and long spin-coherence times, even at room temperature. 202,290 Such properties are rare in solid-state systems, though we note other rival candidates that have been identified in diamond, 291,292 silicon carbide 293,294 and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). 295 The properties of the NV -centre have been the subject of several indepth reviews. 287,296,297 Here, we look to summarise the properties of all charge states of the NV centre.

        <p>NV 0 possesses an S = ½ ground state, but no EPR has ever been detected from this state. The orbital structure of NV 0 has been revealed by recent magnetic circular dichroism measurements, and shown to involve a relatively small spin-orbit interaction in the ground state. 303 Historically, the lack of EPR from the orbitally degenerate NV 0 ground state has been attributed to dynamic Jahn-Teller distortion, 285,298 but recent measurements suggest it may be more a result of strain-broadening. 303 A high-spin S = 3 /2 excited NV 0 state is observed when suitable samples are illuminated with light of energy ≥2.2 eV. 285,304 The most stable charge state of any particular NV defect depends on its local doping environment. We note that the concept of a Fermi level is not strictly applicable to a moderately doped wide-band-gap semiconductor such as diamond. 305 Nonetheless, the concept is useful to illustrate differences in the local charge environments.

        <p>The conversion yield of Ns to NV has been shown to be much higher when electron irradiating at elevated temperature (740°C) than when using the equivalent irradiation dose and then annealing post-irradiation. 328 The precise mechanism is not yet clear, but seems likely to be the result of a reduction in vacancy-recombination and vacancy aggregation. 314 Most of these techniques provide better depth than in-plane resolution, but the latter can be improved by using delta-doping during growth to confine a narrow nitrogen-doped layer within intrinsic buffer layers, achieving layer depth resolutions as thin as 4 nm. 321,329 Implanted nitrogen has been the historic focus in this area, but recent results suggest that those NV -defects which achieve lifetime-limited coherent optical transitions are actually formed by vacancy capture at native nitrogen, rather than at the implanted nitrogen atoms. Nanodiamonds made by pulverising larger CVD, HPHT or natural diamonds, often contain a high concentration of nitrogen as a result of the N present in the originating stones, while DND often contains N atoms from the N-containing high explosives used in their fabrication (see §2.3.2).

In the former, NV defects typically account for &lt;1% of the total nitrogen incorporated during growth, 253 though the nitrogen incorporation rate and the N:NV ratio is highly growth temperature-dependent. 334 As noted in §2.2.3, NV centres formed during CVD growth are sensitive to the plasma conditions and the crystallographic surface presented to the plasma.

For growth on &lt;111&gt; surfaces, it has been shown that in the majority of cases, nitrogen is incorporated first, and the vacancy is subsequently grown over the nitrogen on the next epitaxial layer. 102 In {110} growth, only NV centres whose primary &lt;111&gt; axis is not in the substrate plane are occupied, 253 while growth on {111} substrates produces NV centres whose symmetry axes are all perpendicular to the surface (the other three orientations are effectively unoccupied). 102,103,105 Such preferential orientation of NV centres has also been reported on the &lt;111&gt; surfaces of HPHT-grown crystals. 335 At moderate temperatures (1500-1600°C), NV defects are thought to move through the lattice as a unit ( §3.5.4.5.2). 336 Recent experiments have demonstrated loss of preferential orientation upon annealing at 1500°C, but it is not yet clear whether this is due to the creation of additional NV centres or to the loss of preferential orientation in existing defect centres. 337 and &lt;100&gt; is identical), all four orientations will be populated equally, i.e. 25% each.For other types of lab-grown diamond, NV centres can be grown-in as a unit during CVD or HPHT growth.

        <p>The ground state of the N2V 0 defect has 1 A1 symmetry 342,344 and is thus EPR-inactive. This symmetry was confirmed via uniaxial stress measurements, and the structural form inferred from the production routes in natural diamond samples. 276,344 The atomic structure responsible for the H3 feature was confirmed when photoexcited EPR measurements of H3-containing diamonds identified a spin-triplet excited state with the rhombic symmetry and equivalent nitrogen hyperfine interactions consistent with the N2V model. 345 H3 is one of the most common luminescence centres observed in natural diamond (usually accompanied by N3 luminescencesee §3.5.4.3), and is readily introduced by irradiation and subsequent annealing (800-1600°C) of type IaA diamond. 346 In such material, H3 formation is attributed to the trapping of a vacancy at an A-centre (nearest-neighbour nitrogen pair) through the route N-N-V → N-V-N. 347 As a result, the spatial locations of N2V centres are correlated with the location of nitrogen pairs, leading to ZPL broadening 348 and H3 luminescence quenching via resonant transfer to proximal A-centres. 349,350 N2V is also easily produced by irradiating and annealing HPHT-grown type Ib material (see §3.5.4.5). The defect formation in this case is understood to be dominated by mobile NV centres moving as a unit via emission and recapture of the same vacancy. 336 In turn, the NV centre is captured at an Ns centre, forming N2V. [351][352][353] The window of stability for N2V production in type Ib material is therefore relatively narrow, beginning when the NV centre becomes mobile at ~1500 °C and ending when N2V breaks up via the emission of a vacancy to form A-centres. 352 N2V can also be created during HPHT synthesis. In this case, the defect is observed to be preferentially oriented on the {001} growth surfaces, with only the two possible orientations (of six) whose principal axis are in the growth plane identified post-synthesis. [354][355][356] In natural diamond, H3 has been observed decorating platelets (interstitial aggregates frequently found in natural diamond) and dislocations, 357 resulting in striations of H3 luminescence that follow the local dislocation direction (Figure 26). 358 High-temperature annealing of brown natural diamonds (whose colour originates at dislocations introduced by plastic deformation 359 and which constitute the largest population of natural diamonds by colour 360 ) can result in the generation of N2V centres by the release of vacancies from slip planes. 361 Dislocations are frequently introduced to natural diamond during their violent transport to the surface, and their form and defect decoration play a crucial role in distinguishing natural and lab-grown diamond. 362 H3 has attracted attention on account of its relatively short radiative lifetime ( = 17.5 ns) combined with high fluorescence quantum yield under pulsed excitaion. 350 Thus, there are several reports of the observation of single, isolated N2V 0 centresmaking it a potential singlephoton source.

Nevertheless, the seemingly-simple N3V defect has generated much discussion regarding its electronic structure, and in particular the origin of the N2 absorption transition. 374,377 This may have been resolved by recent thermochromism experiments, which indicate that the N2 and N3 transitions may not share a common origin despite their correlation across several orders of magnitude in strength and large numbers of samples. 378 The atomic structure of N3V 0 was determined via its ground-state EPR spectrum, [379][380][381] which was subsequently correlated with the N3 absorption spectrum. 378 The EPR spectrum of N3V 0 (Figure 28) is complex, due to the similar magnitude of the hyperfine and quadrupole interactions with each of the three equivalent nitrogen atoms. Though the predicted structure based on the atomic model was not in doubt, it was not until 15 N3V 0 in 15 N-enriched synthetic diamond became available that the ground-state spin Hamiltonian parameters could be determined satisfactorily. 382 There is limited (indirect) evidence suggesting the existence of N3V -. In particular, photochromism measurements of samples containing both Ns and N3V defects show a simultaneous increase in the intensities of both N3 absorption and of IR absorption due to Ns 0 when the samples are illuminated with red/green light. 382,383 This can be understood if the N3V - is acting as a donor, via the process N3V -+ Ns + → N3V 0 + Ns 0 (4) and indicates a photoionization threshold for N3V -in the range 1.65-2.2 eV. 382 This is consistent with the results of DFT calculations, which suggest a value ~1.9 eV. 384 It is also similar to the photoionization threshold of Ns 0 , implying that samples containing both Ns 0 and N3V -will be in metastable equilibrium when exposed to green light. 384 The recent observation of simultaneous electronic and nuclear spin polarisation of N3V 0 and Ns 0 has been attributed to spin-selective relaxation in an excited triplet state of N3V -, with local Ns 0 spin polarised via the emission of a spin-polarised current from N3V -. 384 The additional one-electron states required to generate a triplet state in N3V -are derived from the conduction band, rather than the oneelectron states of the defect itself, 384 though this is not corroborated by DFT calculations employing different functionals. 21 In the latter work, the presence of N3V + is also predicted, with an optical transition at ~0.6 eV. 21 These results should serve to motivate further investigation of the structure and properties of N3V -.and lower (~2.6 eV) energy labelled N4 and N2, respectively, as shown in Figure 27. 373 The reported N3 fluorescence lifetime  = 41 ns at 80 K, but this value is specimen dependent and decreases with increasing concentrations of N2 0 centres. 374 The N3 centre is the most common colour centre encountered in natural diamond, 172,375 to the extent that it is one of the primary markers employed in the identification of natural and synthetic diamond. 362 N3 contributes to the characteristic blue emission yielded by most natural diamonds under above-band-gap excitation, in combination with so-called "Band A" emission from dislocation networks. 357,362 N3V 0 retains the C3v symmetry of NV, with the carbon and nitrogen elements nearest-neighbour to the vacancy interchanged (Figure 19).

Thus, the observation that [N2VH 0 ] increased further after annealing at 2000°C suggests the presence of an intermediate step in the annealing process between NVH and N2VH. This might be mediated by VH, which is predicted to diffuse as a unit before dissociating, 419 or by interstitial hydrogen. 433,434 Critically, no infrared absorption from N2 or N4V defects was observed at any stage, despite the production of N3VH 0 after annealing at 1800°C.

        <p>N3VH is common in natural diamond, whereas NVH and N2VH have not been reported. 435 It seems likely that this reflects aggregation towards N3VH over geological timescales. But, in summary, the aggregation mechanisms and kinetics of high-nitrogen, high-hydrogen containing diamond clearly require further study. Such studies are particularly important given the production of nitrogen-doped CVD diamond for magnetometry applicationsdiscussed in Section 4. where there is a radical remaining in the NnV family there is potential for it to be saturated with a hydrogen, as illustrated above with the NnVH group of defects.

        <p>The only remaining defect in this family is NVH2. The ground state of the neutral defect would have S = ½, but the negatively and positively charged versions of the defect will both have S = 0 ground states. Thus, the neutral NVH2 defect should be EPR active, and all charge states of the NVH2 defect should also be IR active. The simplest explanation for the non-detection of such multiple-hydrogen-containing defects is that they are not present. Given the range of other nitrogen-containing defects discussed above, however, this might be surprising. Alternatively, the concentrations of these defects might be below current detection limits if, for example, they are transient species.

        <p>There is a ceaseless drive in commercial HPHT synthesis towards greater process efficiency, seeking to reduce the temperature and pressure required for growth (and thus the price) of commercially viable diamonds. 19 The addition of the metal catalyst ( §2.1) enables growth at lower temperatures and the formation of larger single crystal diamonds. The catalyst/solvent of choice is usually a transition metal, either as the element or as an alloy like Fe-Ni-C or Fe-Co-C. Thus, metallic flux (a tell-tale sign of HPHT growth) and point defects associated with material in the melt can be incorporated into HPHT diamond. Both Ni and Co are incorporated into {111} but not {100} or minor growth sectors. 400 This introduces a new family of aggregates that contain both transition metals and nitrogen, many of which have now been identified by applying EPR spectroscopy to HPHT material grown with known transition-metal catalysts and annealed to facilitate nitrogen aggregation. Defects identified by EPR have in some cases been correlated with optical signatures. 214,[437][438][439] Transition-metal-nitrogen aggregates are also occasionally found in natural diamond, but at much lower concentrations than found in lab-grown diamond. 440 Ni-related defects have attracted particular interest as a potential rival to NV centres as a singlephoton source, 441 and in vivo biomarker/thermometry 442,443 applications, though more recent measurements indicate their optical properties are less favourable than the group-IV-vacancy defects (see below). 444 Ni is readily incorporated substitutionally during HPHT growth. 445 Co is much less readily incorporated and there is no clear evidence for incorporation of Fe into the diamond lattice. This might seem surprising, given the relative atomic sizes: silicon, for example, with a smaller atomic radius, is incorporated in diamond in a split-vacancy structure. 446 It can be understood, however, by recognising the tetrahedral crystal-field stabilization of the 3d-orbitals into e and t2 states. In the case of Nis, for example, four electrons participate in bonding with the surrounding carbons leaving a 3d 6 (i.e. e 4 t2 2 ) configuration on the Nis centre. The Ni-C bond lengths are 2.04 Å, which is not atypical of a metal-ligand bond but highly strained relative to the surrounding diamond construct. 438 This substitutional defect is incorporated in the negative charge state due to the presence of nitrogen acting as a donor making it S = 3 /2. 447 This structure is highly strained, however, and can be removed by annealing at Tanneal ~1700-1800 K). 438,448 In the case of Nis, it is thought that a carbon interstitial is created thermally, local to the nickel, and the substitutional defect relaxes into the vacancy, yielding a NiV defect (Figure 34(a)) with lower elastic strain. Note that the V in this descriptor can also be found described in the literature as a split-vacancy, double semi-vacancy, semi-vacancy pair or confusingly termed a di-vacancy. The NiV defect is labelled NE4/AB1 in EPR when in the negative charge state [449][450][451][452][453] and NE4* when neutral, 454 the Ni has the electronic configuration 3d 5 and is S = ½. 440 The symmetry was determined to be D3d, with the Ni atom surrounded by six carbons arranged in a distorted octahedral arrangement with Ni-C bond lengths ~1.8 Å. 440,455 At temperatures where Nis converts to NiV with emission of a carbon interstitial, the interstitial is highly mobile. It is trapped by Ns 0 , converting this to the mobile Ni, which itself is trapped releasing the carbon interstitial so that the process can be repeated (see §3.5.4.5.1). The diffusion of nitrogen is thus greatly enhanced. The NiV defect is a relatively stable trap of nitrogen and defects have been identified where 2, 3, and 4 of the 6 nearest-neighbour carbon atoms have been replaced with N atoms.

        <p>During CVD growth, there is potential for Si to be incorporated into the diamond, either unintentionally via contamination from the quartz optical windows on the reactor (Figure 7) or by intentionally doping by adding a trace of SiH4 to the process gas mixture. 484 Si can also be incorporated during HPHT growth and with ion implantation. The SiV 0 defect identified in EPR and confirmed with theory can also act as a trap for nitrogen, and the SiVN defect is believed to have been identified. 485 Speculations have also appeared concerning nitrogen-phosphorus aggregates, which are not based around a vacancy but rather resemble substitutional pairs of nitrogen and phosphorus atoms. After 10 min annealing at 2600 K, the initial group of defects (labelled NP1-NP3) As noted in the Introduction, geochemical studies on mineral inclusions in diamonds have fundamentally shaped our understanding of where natural diamonds come from and the geological history of our planet. 486 The chemical composition of inclusions provides information about diamond formation, mantle storage and distribution. The early studies of inclusions in diamonds led to two important discoveriesfirst, that diamonds form long before the kimberlite (or lamproite) in which they are transported to the near surface and, second, that minerals included in diamonds can be related to rock types that are characteristic of depths 150 -200 km underlying ancient cratons (old and stable parts of the continental lithosphere, which comprises the Earth's two topmost layers, the crust and the uppermost mantle (recall Figure 1)). [487][488][489] The state of nitrogen aggregation in natural diamond depends on nitrogen concentration, mantle residence time and mantle temperature. Under the temperature conditions prevailing in the Earth's mantle, aggregation of nitrogen from single substitutional atoms to pairs (A-centres, see Figure 3) typically happens very quickly, but aggregation from the A-centre to the B-centre occurs at a much slower rate. 490 Rare natural type Ib diamonds have not experienced temperatures above ~850 C for any extended geological period, suggesting that after formation they were rapidly transported to shallower and cooler depths. 491 The very high sensitivity to temperature and relatively weak dependence on residence time makes nitrogen A-to B-centre aggregation a useful geo-thermometer but a very poor geo-chronometer.During CVD growth, there is potential for Si to be incorporated into the diamond, either unintentionally via contamination from the quartz optical windows on the reactor (Figure 7) or by intentionally doping by adding a trace of SiH4 to the process gas mixture. 484 Si can also be incorporated during HPHT growth and with ion implantation.

The Diamond Producers Association has developed a protocol to test the performance of diamond verification instruments in a consistent manner. 498 Although such instruments operate in a variety of different ways, most use one or more spectroscopic techniques to identify the nature of the gem under test. For example, the DiamondSure 362,416 instrument (produced by De Beers Technologies) interrogates the optical absorption of the sample, looking for the presence or absence of different defects, including the N3V 0 (N3) defect observed in 98% of natural diamonds. Other instruments make use of photoluminescence and/or photoluminescence imaging. Again, it is often the presence, absence or relative concentrations of different nitrogen related defects in the diamond, that are used to determine whether the stone is natural, treated (e.g. HPHT annealed to remove unwanted defects that affect the colour, or irradiated and annealed to introduce defects that give the diamond a desirable colour, etc.) or lab-grown. Usually it is the combinations of nitrogen defects present that are used to determine the origin (natural/lab-grown) and treatment history of the diamond, but the presence/absence of other defects (notably those incorporating transition metals, silicon and hydrogen) also provides very useful information.Given the value of natural diamond gem stones an arsenal of diamond verification instruments have been developed to separate and/or to identify natural diamonds from lab-grown diamonds and simulants.

        <p>As shown in §2.3.2, there is a confusing array of nanodiamonds available, produced by a variety of methods. 140 Strategies for removing unwanted sp 2 carbon (as well as other materials used in the synthesis), for de-agglomeration and for modification/functionalisation of the diamond surface all remain very active research areas. There has been much discussion regarding the biocompatibility and fate of nanodiamonds in the body, 499 and their use in applications such as tribology and lubrication, nanocomposites, tissue scaffolds and surgical implants and drug delivery. 140,500,501 For many applications, the presence or absence of nitrogen in the nanodiamond is relatively unimportant.

        <p>Aside from the quantum applications, their bright luminescence, combined with their readily modifiable surface and biocompatibility, make diamond nanoparticles containing fluorescent NV centres extremely promising for biomedical applications, 503 and, in particular, for use as a bio-marker to 'tag' biomolecules of interest as they travel around within living organisms. 504- 508 Nanodiamond bio-markers have a number of advantages over competing luminescent probes, such as quantum dots, fluorescent proteins (e.g. Green Fluorescent Protein, GFP) or organic dyes (e.g. Alexa Fluor, fluorescein). First, for imaging of medium-to long-term biological processes, the NV centres in NDs are stable and do not photobleach, unlike the luminescent centres in most of their competitors which often emit intermittently ('blink') and eventually reduce in intensity ('bleach') until they become too faint to see. 509 Second, for longterm exposure, quantum dots can leach their (potentially toxic) chemical components into the cell cytoplasm, 510 whereas ND has been shown to have very low toxicity to most cell types. 499,500 Further, the emission from NV-containing NDs is typically in the wavelength range 625-800 nm, which is ideal for penetrating through tissuethus allowing observation via an external microscopeand well clear of the wavelengths at which cells autofluoresce (300-500 nm). 511 The fact that the surface of NDs can be chemically functionalised is another big advantage, allowing the attachment of a wide variety of biologically interactive species, such as simple hydrophilic/hydrophobic groups, proteins, antibodies, anti-cancer drugs and even DNA strands (Figure 14). Thus, quite apart from applications to monitor and investigate physiological processes within cells, there is growing interest in the use of NDs for targeted delivery of biological payloads to modulate the function of certain cell types. For example, NDs have been chemically modified to seek out and bind to cancer cells, and then deliver a cargo of a specific anti-cancer drug directly to those cells without harming neighbouring healthy cells. 512 The use of NV-containing NDs for biomarking is possible because of their nanosize; they are sufficiently small that they can pass through the various membranes surrounding living cell structures without causing the cells any apparent damage. Once inside the cell, they diffuse to all regions of the cytoplasmexcept the nucleus, into which NDs seem unable to penetrate. 513- 517 As Figure 35 electron spin can be optically initialised into the mS = 0 ground state. 520 As discussed in §3.5.4.1, microwave excitation of the ground state mS = 0 to mS = 1 transition results in a 30% reduction in the NV -photoluminescence emission, allowing for optical determination of the spin stateeven at room temperature. 521 The weakness of the spin-orbit coupling and the high Debye temperature of diamond ensures that the NV -electron spin has an exceptionally long spin lattice relaxation time (T2 can reach 5 ms at room temperature and exceed hours at cryogenic temperatures). 522,523 Dephasing of the spin state can be mitigated by reducing the concentration of unwanted paramagnetic impurities and of 13 C spins. In isotopically purified samples, T2 * (the timescale of magnetic fluctuations) can exceed 100 s at room temperature, and dynamical decoupling can extend spin coherence to the homogeneous dephasing time T2. 202,524 The NV -electron polarisation can be transferred to and from nearby nuclear spins using radio-frequency and microwave excitation.

        <p>As illustrated in Figure 20, NV centres located within a diamond lattice behave as isolated 'chromophores', with a set of energy levels distinct from those of the diamond. When excited with a burst of photons from a laser, a single NV will absorb only one photon. When it subsequently relaxes, the NV will re-emit only a single photon (with reduced energy), and this photon emerges with a specific optically readable spin. 306 The photon can be captured in a suitable optical waveguide and transported where required. After a suitable delay, the NV resets, and can absorb and re-emit another photon. Thus, NV centres act as excellent sources of single photons, 526 underpinning a host of applications involving quantum computing and quantum information processing. 527 Many of these applications involve the curious phenomenon of quantum entanglement. 528 When two particles (or photons) are brought together, their wavefunctions can mix (entangle), such that when the particles separate, each retains some information about their partner. In the case of two photons emitted from separate NV centres, their spins can become entangled if the photons are brought together in the same waveguide. When separated again, the spin of one photon can be instantaneously determined by observing the spin of the second photon, regardless of separation distance. In this regard, the entangled photons form a quantum bit (qubit). In contrast to a traditional binary computing bit, which can be either zero or one, a qubit is both 1 and 0 at the same time. Coupling two or more qubits allows multiple complex calculations to be done simultaneously, rather than sequentially, potentially offering greatly increased computational speeds. The more qubits that can be entangled, the greater the computational power: recent results in diamond have demonstrated a robust 10-qubit register comprised of nuclear spins coupled to an NV -centre [529]. This is one of the driving forces behind the fabrication of grids of equally spaced NV centres in diamond, such as those shown in Figure 22(b).As illustrated in Figure 20, NV centres located within a diamond lattice behave as isolated 'chromophores', with a set of energy levels distinct from those of the diamond.
