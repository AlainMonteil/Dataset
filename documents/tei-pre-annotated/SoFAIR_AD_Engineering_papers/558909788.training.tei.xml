        <p>tems have entered the stage of commercial development, providing users with new services and improved user experiences as well as offering a host of novel opportunities to various industries. However, 5G still faces many challenges. To address these challenges, international industrial, academic, and standards organizations have commenced research on sixth generation (6G) wireless communication systems. A series of white papers and survey papers have been published, which aim to define 6G in terms of requirements, application scenarios, key technologies, etc. Although ITU-R has been working on the 6G vision and it is expected to reach a consensus on what 6G will be by mid-2023, the related global discussions are still wide open and the existing literature has identified numerous open issues. This paper first provides a comprehensive portrayal of the 6G vision, technical requirements, and application scenarios, covering the current common understanding of 6G. Then, a critical appraisal of the 6G network architecture and key technologies is presented. Furthermore, existing testbeds and advanced 6G verification platforms are detailed for the first time. In addition, future research directions and open challenges are identified for stimulating the on-going global debate. Finally, lessons learned to date concerning 6G networks are discussed.tems have entered the stage of commercial development, providing users with new services and improved user experiences as well as offering a host of novel opportunities to various industries.

        <p>W ITH the rapid development of communication appli- cations, communication technologies are undergoing revolutionary changes generation after generation. Up till now, the development of cellular mobile communication systems has undergone five generations. From the first generation (1G) analog communication systems to fifth generation (5G) digital communication systems, each generation incorporates higher frequencies, larger bandwidths, and higher data rates. Starting from 2019, 5G has been officially commercialized, employing sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, with a peak rate of 20 Gbps. From the architecture's perspective, mobile communication systems have been evolving towards more antennas, more advanced multiple access technologies, and richer services, as shown in Fig. 1. The 5G base stations exploit massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) [1], mmWave, and ultra-dense networking (UDN) technologies [2], supporting up to 64 transceiver chains with more antenna elements. Currently, commercial 5G base station products using 128 antennas are mature, and HUAWEI is the first to release a massive MIMO base station with 384 antennas [3]. In addition, 5G can support augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and Internet of Everything (IoE).W ITH the rapid development of communication appli- cations, communication technologies are undergoing revolutionary changes generation after generation.

        <p>Although 5G offers significant improvements over fourth generation (4G) communication systems, it still has several limitations. Currently, there are applications and services requiring better communication performance that is beyond 5G's capabilities, such as global coverage, ultra-high data rate transmission, ultra-low latency, ultra-dense connection, high precision positioning, ultra-reliable and safe connection, low power consumption, high energy efficiency (EE), as well as ubiquitous intelligence. To address these limitations, several challenges need to be addressed. Global maritime communications and satellite communications in high-latitude regions need to be further explored to achieve global coverage. Ultrahigh data rate transmission needs to be significantly improved so that the peak data rate can reach Tbps level, supporting services such as ultra high-definition video and telemedicine. At low transmission speed, the end-to-end (E2E) latency needs to be less than 1 millisecond, while at high speed, the latency should reach the microsecond level. The connection density should reach 10 8 devices/km 2 , meeting the needs of connecting dense crowds and industrial equipment. In addition, the positioning accuracy needs to be improved to achieve an outdoor centimeter level and an indoor sub-centimeter level for high precision positioning. A series of novel applications such as tactile Internet, vehicle to everything (V2X), and wireless data centers, have higher requirements for reliability. Energy consumption is also a key issue for many applications, and consequently the power consumption needs to be reduced and the network EE needs to be increased by 100 fold. Moreover, a great number of intelligent applications prompt communication systems to have a higher intelligence level. By analyzing the gaps between 5G capabilities and future demands, Table I summarizes the limitations and challenges of 5G, which are expected to be explored and resolved in sixth generation (6G) communication systems. Detailed analysis of 5G and 6G KPIs will be introduced later.Although 5G offers significant improvements over fourth generation (4G) communication systems, it still has several limitations.

        <p>6G is expected to be different from 5G in several aspects. From the perspective of application requirements, 5G extended the "Mobile Internet" in 4G to the "IoE". Based on 5G, 6G will continue to enhance the mobile Internet and IoE but will also deeply integrate them with AI and big data to realize the intelligent IoE. As for technical requirements, compared with 5G, 6G will pursue wider coverage, higher rates, more connections, ultra-low latency, ultra-high positioning accuracy, integration of communications and sensing, more intelligence, more security, and better substitutability. Note that 6G will be a network that goes beyond communication. These application requirements and technical requirements lead us to envision what the 6G will be like. While 5G is being rolled out globally, a number of research initiatives have proposed ideas for the 6G vision. In Sept. 2019, the 6G flagship led by the University of Oulu published the world's first 6G research white paper and proposed the vision of "ubiquitous wireless intelligence" for 6G [4]. In Mar. 2020, the white paper on 6G concept and vision published by the CCID envisaged 6G to open up a unified network of ubiquitous intelligent connection between virtual and real worlds [25]. In Nov. 2020, UNISOC published a white paper, hoping 6G can achieve the link between macro and micro, the fusion of virtual and reality, the mapping between digital and physical, the crossing of past and future, and the matching between technologies and requirements, emphasizing the importance of AI [30]. In Dec. 2020, it was expected by DATANG Mobile that the 6G capability of basic communication, intelligence, wireless sensing, network security, and network computing power would be enhanced [31]. In Apr. 2021, the NGMN alliance analyzed driving factors of 6G and presented the overall vision of 6G in terms of 6G attributes and key design considerations [36]. In June 2021, the IMT-2030 promotion group envisaged the 6G vision of "intelligent connection of everything and digital twins" [32]. In Aug. 2021, HUAWEI looked forward that 6G would realize the "Intelligence-ofeverything", the interconnection of people and things would eventually evolve into an intelligence interconnection [27]. In addition to 6G white papers that have been published by different organizations, the 6G vision has also been put forward in numerous works [40]- [42], [46]- [48], [50]- [52], [54], [59]. Three characteristics of 6G were envisioned in [40], i.e., mobile ultra-broadband, super Internet of Things (IoT), and AI. The authors of [41] believed that 6G will enable the blueprint of connecting everything, full-dimensional coverage, technology cross-integration, and human-like intelligent autonomy. A six-F trend set was proposed for 6G in [42] as "full spectra, full coverage, full dimension, full convergence, full photonics, full intelligence". In [46], the "human-thing intelligence" interconnectivity and tactile communication were envisioned for 6G. Saad et al. [47] emphasized the importance of technology convergence, and proposed a holistic 6G vision in terms of applications, trends and technologies. The authors of [48] identified that 6G is for the interconnection of physical, biological, and digital worlds. China Mobile [50] summarized the 6G vision as "digital twin and ubiquitous intelligence". It was looked ahead in [51] that the human society would become a ubiquitous intelligent mobile society in the 6G era.6G is expected to be different from 5G in several aspects.

        <p>Overall, the 6G vision can be descripted as "global coverage, all spectra, full applications, all senses, all digital, and strong security", as shown in Fig. 3. In order to achieve global coverage, 6G will expand from terrestrial communication to an integrated space-air-ground-sea communication network. In order to meet the application requirements of huge traffic and huge connection, the full spectra will be fully mined by 6G communication networks, including sub-6 GHz, mmWave, THz, and optical bands. In order to serve various vertical industries, communications, computing, storage, control, sensing, positioning, AI, and big data will be deeply integrated, giving birth to full application scenarios such as ISAC. 6G will also provide users with a full sensory experience through holographic communications and storage, immersive extended reality (XR), tactile Internet, and other applications. Based on the digital twin, 6G will realize the mapping between the digital world and the physical world, and finally realize the intelligent connection of "human-machine-things-environment". Strong security is embodied by taking the security into account when designing the communication network, known as network endogenous security [61], including physical layer security and network layer security. Combined with AI, 6G will also achieve intelligent endogenous security.Overall, the 6G vision can be descripted as "global coverage, all spectra, full applications, all senses, all digital, and strong security", as shown in Fig. 3.

        <p>Currently, communication services are largely limited to terrestrial mobile communications, while remote areas and special scenarios are still blind zones. In order to achieve ubiquitous global coverage, 6G will expand from terrestrial communications to space-air-ground-sea communications, integrating satellite communications [62], unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications [63], terrestrial ultra-dense com-munication networks, maritime communications [64], underwater communications [65], and underground communications [66]. By integrating various communication networks, 6G will achieve seamless three-dimensional (3D) ubiquitous coverage and connectivity, providing multiple communication services. The global coverage can provide communication services to users with outside the coverage of terrestrial communication networks, such as the remote area Internet access, enhanced on-board communications [54], and communications in underground mines. In the event of terrestrial communication network outage due to disasters (e.g., flood and fire), space-air networks can provide fast, stable, and high-quality emergency services. The full-space deep coverage can also realize the full-space environment monitoring, deep-sea exploration, and other services.Currently, communication services are largely limited to terrestrial mobile communications, while remote areas and special scenarios are still blind zones.

        <p>As new high-data rate communication services and applications continue to evolve, the demand for wireless mobile traffic is increasing exponentially. Existing communication systems are facing the challenge of spectrum congestion in the radio frequency (RF) band, which is insufficient for higher rate services. The 5G has already made nearly full use of sub-6 GHz and started to explore the mmWave band [71]. In the 6G era, in order to meet the technical requirements of huge traffic and huge connection, all spectra including sub-6 GHz, centimeter wave (cmWave), mmWave, THz [72], and optical wireless bands [73] will be fully exploited. The THz band has the advantages of huge bandwidth and ultra-high data rate [74], providing strong support for the 6G wireless data center [75], nano Internet [76], ultra-short distance communications, and other new application scenarios. The optical bands used for optical wireless communications (OWCs) include infrared (IR), visible light, and ultraviolet (UV) bands, with nearly thousands of THz of unused spectral resources. Moreover, the visible light band has a number of advantages, including being green and economical, no spectrum regulation, high security, no electromagnetic (EM) interference [77]. In the scenario where RF communications are limited, OWCs have great application potential and have spawned a series of optical communication technologies, including visible light communications (VLC), light fidelity (LiFi), optical camera communications (OCC), free space optical (FSO) communications, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) [78]. As the first effort on the THz standardization work towards 6G, the IEEE 802.15.3d standard was released for the THz band in the 300 GHz [79]. In terms of the standardization for OWCs, existing work includes the IEEE 802.11 standard related to diffuse IR communications [80], the IEEE 802. 15.7r1 aiming at short range OWCs [81], and the IEEE 802.15.13 working on multi-Gigabit/s OWCs [82]. In addition, the IEEE 802.11bb task group had been working on integrating the light medium in the base IEEE 802.11 standards [83]. Based on the sub-6 GHz band and mmWave band of 5G, 6G will explore higher frequency bands as needed, and finally realize the deep mining of the full spectra. Multiple frequency bands will coexist and fuse with each other, to enable different services.As new high-data rate communication services and applications continue to evolve, the demand for wireless mobile traffic is increasing exponentially.

Thanks to the development of deterministic networks [114], it can achieve 1 us for 6G [4], [25], [27], [29], [30], [34], [35], [44], [48], [50]- [54], [108], [109] [27], [53], [109].</p>
        <p>2) Capacity &amp; Coverage: In order to support growing demands for next-generation new scenarios, such as smart factory and smart city, higher air traffic capacity and connection density are considered as essential conditions. The area traffic capacity is expected to achieve 10 Gbps/m 2 [25], [27], [29], [34], [44], [50], [53], and the connection density is expected to be 10 8 devices/km 2 [4], [50], [52], [108]. Providing users with broader and seamless coverage is another important requirement of 6G networks. For 6G, 3D global coverage is expected to extend the 5G two-dimensional (2D) terrestrial coverage [54]. The 5G network can only cover land and some offshore areas, only 20% of land and 5% of ocean [111], approximately equal to 10% of the whole earth. The coverage percentage of 6G network is expected to be more than 99% [51], [58]. In high-value areas, 6G coverage needs to further improve EE and user experience, while in low-value areas, it is important to reduce coverage costs [108].2) Capacity &amp; Coverage: In order to support growing demands for next-generation new scenarios, such as smart factory and smart city, higher air traffic capacity and connection density are considered as essential conditions.

        <p>3) Service efficiency: In order to meet the need for sustainable development, we propose three efficiency-related indicators, taking the service efficiency at multiple levels into account. Owing to the development of advanced spectrum management technologies, the spectrum efficiency (SE) of 6G systems can triple that of 5G, reaching 90 bps/Hz [30], [44], [51], [52], [54], [58]. Network EE refers to the number of bits transmitted over 1 Joule. According to [108], the consumption of a typical 5G base station is about 1-2 kW for an average data rate of 10 Gbps. Therefore, network EE is about 10 7 bit/J for 5G. For 6G, it is expected to increase by about 100 times in order to provide more efficient services with the same or lower energy consumption [27], [52], [108].3) Service efficiency: In order to meet the need for sustainable development, we propose three efficiency-related indicators, taking the service efficiency at multiple levels into account.

        <p>As a complement to SE and EE, economic efficiency was introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of the trade-off [115]- [117]. In [118], a similar concept named cost efficiency was proposed as the ratio of user's data consumption benefit and its data traffic cost. The trade-off between cost efficiency and EE for 5G system was analyzed in [119]. However, it was not until the advance of 6G system that the importance of cost efficiency was gradually appreciated. For 6G, cost efficiency will help equipment providers and service teams to consider the profitability of the communication industry while providing quality services to consumers. In [108], it was proposed that spending on communication for a user is expected to be less than 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. As a rough estimate, the cost efficiency of 5G is about 10 Gb/$, with $10,000 GDP per capita and 100 GB/user/month communication cost. The cost efficiency for 6G will become 500 Gb/$, based on a doubling of GDP per capita and a 100-fold increase in service traffic. 4) Diversified service evaluation: 6G networks will largely enhance and extend 5G applications [52]. With the increase of applications, some indicators will be introduced to evaluate the diversified service quality for 6G communication systems. High-speed mobile communication scenarios, such as highspeed aircrafts and ultra-high-speed trains, place high demands on mobility. The mobility of transceivers in 6G communication systems can be more than 1000 km/h, which is a huge increase compared with that in 5G [25], [29], [30], [44], [50], [51], [53], [54], [57], [108], [109]. In [4], it was pointed out that limited batteries would be an evident obstacle for the development of IoT communication. Besides, in [27], it was stated that scenarios such as smart city and smart home would have high requirements on the battery life of sensing devices, and it would be necessary to improve the battery life to ensure the stable availability of sensing devices. The longest battery life for smart scenarios is expected to be 20 years [4], [27], [53]. The development of the IoT places high demands on the reliability of the communication system, that is, the correctness of the transmitted information under a certain upper delay limit. From Table V, it can be seen that reliability is not included in [107] but has attracted considerable attention for 6G. Reliability requirements of 6G networks are expected to be application specific. For stringent scenarios such as strengthened ultra-reliable and low latency communications (uRLLC), only one erroneous bit is permitted in 10 million transmitted bits [48], [53], [57], [109]. Sensing positioning and imaging are important foundations for smart connections of all things. 6G positioning accuracy is expected to reach 1 m for outdoor scenarios and 10 cm for indoor scenarios [4], [25], [108]. 6G sensing/imaging resolution is expected to reach 1 mm [27]. In addition, two important indicators, security capacity and intelligence level, are proposed to qualitatively evaluate the service capability of 6G systems. It is believed that 6G communication systems can achieve endogenous security through new technologies, such as quantum communication and blockchain, so that the system can have a higher security capacity. Related indicators have been considered in [4], [29], [34], [45], [52]- [54], [108]. Besides, with the accelerated per-meation of AI, the intelligence level of the 6G communication system is expected to be greatly enhanced [29], [30], [45], [52].

        <p>In the 5G era, there are three main application scenarios, i.e., enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and uRLLC, aiming to meet high requirements for large bandwidth and high data rate, large connection density, high reliability and low latency, respectively. A number of relevant papers have demonstrated their outlooks for 6G application scenarios.

        <p>Generally, 6G will continue to enhance and expand the above application scenarios to achieve further-eMBB (feMBB), ultra-mMTC (umMTC), and enhanced-uRLLC (eu-RLLC). In 2030, these three scenarios will not only meet traditional KPIs, such as data rate, connection density, and delay in communication systems, but also new KPIs in imaging, positioning, sensing, security capacity, and intelligence level, etc. Moreover, with the integration and development of technologies, 6G will also develop several potential application scenarios that combine characteristics of different kinds of scenarios. In addition to the three scenarios strengthened from 5G, it is envisioned that 6G will also provide additional application scenarios including: 1) massive eMBB (meMBB), aiming at high data rate, large bandwidth, and large connection density, e.g., dense scene communications; 2) mobile broadband reliable and low latency communication (MBRLLC), for scenarios with high data rate, large bandwidth, low latency, and high reliability, e.g., wireless data centers and wireless brainmachine interfaces; 3) massive uRLLC (muRLLC), requiring low delay and high reliability while having large connections for large-scale machine-type communication in special scenarios, e.g., smart transportation, smart factory, and industrial IoT. Moreover, there could be other potential scenarios, such as extremely low-power communications, digital twin applications, space-air-ground-sea integrated networks, as well as long-distance and high-mobility communications. Our vision for 6G application scenarios is shown in Fig. 6. Next, several representative new application scenarios envisioned in the 6G era will be discussed. modern society. In addition, technologies, such as AI and big data, are also expected to dig deeper into the hidden information embedded in the data to achieve more intelligent applications. In addition to focusing on technological development, these massive amount of data also need enough space to store. At present, data centers are mainly wired, with high complexity, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and large space [46]. The demand for wireless data centers arises at the moment. However, due to the challenges of implementing ultra-high data rate transmission in existing wireless communication systems, they cannot meet the needs of data centers for data storage, transmission, and scheduling.

        <p>2) Tactile Internet: As summarized in Fig. 1, communication services in previous generations mainly focused on the digitization of visual and auditory information. With the advent of the 6G era, users' tactile information can also be collected, digitized, and transmitted over the network, finally forming the tactile Internet. The basic characteristics of the tactile Internet include the implementation of perception and synchronization actions, which can be used to transfer "skills" [91]. Tactile robots will act as a multi-modal avatar of human beings through the tactile Internet [124]. The users' tactile information can be transmitted through the network, and remote robots complete corresponding actions according to the users' command. After acquiring the real-time status remotely, users can interact and control accordingly. The transmission of tactile information has very high requirements on the network delay and reliability. In the future, doctors can remotely guide robots to perform physical examinations through the tactile Internet, and remote robots can help miners to complete mining in high-risk areas. With the possible realization of ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability communications, remote robotic surgery [92] may also become possible.2) Tactile Internet: As summarized in Fig. 1, communication services in previous generations mainly focused on the digitization of visual and auditory information.

        <p>3) Digital twin applications: At present, both academia and industry are exploring the connection between the physical real world and the digital world. With the further development and evolution of the digital twin technology, the physical reality will be more precisely digitized. The digital world and the physical world will map to and influence each other, achieving simultaneous development [30], [99], [125]. What's amazing is that, with the help of AI and other intelligent technologies, users' operations and predictions in the digital world can correspond to the conditions in the physical world, which provides a reference for decision-making in the physical world. Digital twins are expected to be used in many fields [31], [52], [95], [126], [127]. Typically, the city digital twin system [95] is envisaged to include interconnected digital twins of urban infrastructure, transportation networks, urban ecological environment, power systems, and other systems, providing a series of functions, such as the environmental monitoring, emergency warning, and risk prediction. The realization of the city digital twin will help the rapid and effective decisionmaking of emergency plans and evaluation on urban design management plans. Another example is the digital twin body area network [52], which can simulate a virtual human body through 6G and information and communications technology (ICT). It can track around the clock, predict diseases in advance, and simulate the operations and medication on the virtual human body. The efficacy of drugs can be predicted which can speed up drug development, reduce costs, and improve the quality of human life. The combination of digital twin body area network and cloud, fog, sensor layer computing and other technologies will also help epidemic management, such as corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including infection source search, drug development and other aspects.

        <p>4) Wireless brain-machine interface applications: The wireless brain-machine interface is a method to help users control electronic devices through their brains, and is often used to provide intelligent communication between users and smart home applications or medical equipment [128], [129]. It transmits the users' brain signals to the electronic device, and these signals are analyzed and converted into the command and operations for the device [43]. The wireless brain-machine interface is initially used in medical scenarios, providing a new method of transmitting information on patients with neurolog-ical injuries and diseases, such as paralysis and Parkinson's, to bring qualitative changes to the quality of their life. Recently, 
            <rs type="software">BrainGate</rs> has implemented a high-bandwidth, high-precision, and low-power wireless brain-machine interface system with which two paralyzed testers can "perform" clicking and typing on a tablet computer using their brain signals only [130]. Also, the wireless system has been tested and its performance is very close to that of wired computer peripherals. The authors of [131] proposed a fully integrated wireless sensor brainmachine interface, which can transmit key somatosensory signals, fingertip strength, and limb joint angles to the brain, providing a new solution for transmitting somatosensory feedback for the next generation of neuroprosthetics. In addition to applications in medical and health care scenarios, the wireless brain-computer interface in 6G may also help users better communicate with the environment and other users who use wireless brain-computer interface-supported devices [47]. In the future, smarter 6G with higher speed, higher reliability, lower latency, higher perception accuracy, and lower power consumption will help the realization of wireless brainmachine interfaces, providing impetus for the realization of a smarter life.

People can see and interact with holographic images of others, as if people were communicating face to face in the same place. On the basis of traditional 2D video communication, holographic communication can present high-precision real-time 3D images, requiring very large bandwidth, low latency, and highprecision resolution. Information including the 2D resolution, color and 3D tilt, angle and position will be transmitted through the communication network [54]. In addition to realtime holographic communications in the real world, holographic communication will also bring users the experience of connecting with the past and the future [30]. Whether they are people who have passed away, things that have disappeared, or things that have not yet appeared, they can all be preserved and constructed in a holographic manner. Users will be able to communicate with these past and future holographic images, and get a new experience in the past and future worlds.5) Holographic communication: In many science fiction movies, there have been scenarios where the protagonist communicates with another person's virtual image, which is expected to become a reality in the 6G era.

Users will be able to communicate with these past and future holographic images, and get a new experience in the past and future worlds.</p>
        <p>6) Emergency rescue communication: From 1G to 5G, the terrestrial mobile communication system has achieved higher coverage, larger bandwidth, faster speed, lower delay, and denser network. However, when an area suffers from largescale natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides or other severe accidents caused by humans, the terrestrial communication network in the area may be completely paralyzed. People who need help cannot send out distress signals in time, and the external rescue task will also be hindered. Besides, there is not enough communication network coverage in several scenarios, such as oceans and deserts. In the event of accidents and emergencies, the golden 72 hours will be the key to saving people's lives. With the further realization of 3D full space coverage in 6G, UAV [132]- [134] and satellite communication networks [132], [135] will respond quickly and be deployed on demand, providing emergency communications to help quick search and rescue. Taking the golden rescue time into account, it is required to quickly provide a large-bandwidth network deployment with sufficient coverage area. At the same time, because the non-terrestrial networks have high battery requirements, it is hoped that the power consumption can be as low as possible and the emergency communication system can support for a longer period of time.6) Emergency rescue communication: From 1G to 5G, the terrestrial mobile communication system has achieved higher coverage, larger bandwidth, faster speed, lower delay, and denser network.

        <p>7) Immersive XR: XR is the collective term for VR, AR, and mixed reality (MR). The VR enables users to interact with another completely virtual digital world, while the AR provides users with an interactive experience of virtual objects in real physical worlds. The MR integrates the VR and AR, providing interactions for users with the real world, digital VR world and completely virtual objects [43]. Although XR has some practical applications in the 5G era, it is still in the initial stage, similar to the video services of the mobile Internet [54]. With the continuous development of computing, communication, sensing, imaging, storage, and other technologies, 6G will achieve a fully immersive XR. The virtual five senses including sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste will be digitalized and transmitted. The video image resolution will be higher, the color will be more real, and the delay will be lower, giving users a more realistic and immersive feeling. In the future, 6G's ultra-high data rate, ultra-large bandwidth, low latency, high reliability, high imaging resolution, high sensing capabilities, and other characteristics will make immersive XR applications possible, which can be used in a series of scenarios such as entertainment, telemedicine, and remote industrial control.7) Immersive XR: XR is the collective term for VR, AR, and mixed reality (MR).

        <p>Due to the development of communication technologies and the enrichment of service requirements, 6G will provide a more comprehensive and high-quality communication experience and will exceed 5G in system performance on all fronts as shown in Table VI. To evaluate 6G more thoroughly, the proposed 17 KPIs can be used to analyze system performance in terms of network transmission performance, network access performance, network efficiency, and QoS.Due to the development of communication technologies and the enrichment of service requirements, 6G will provide a more comprehensive and high-quality communication experience and will exceed 5G in system performance on all fronts as shown in Table VI.

        <p>Although 6G will have a step change in these 17 KPIs, the KPIs often cannot be improved simultaneously in the same system due to hardware impairments, actual propagation environment and other limitations [136]. Moreover, performance improvements in communication systems often come at the cost of energy consumption. According to [137], the energy consumption of 5G is more than three times that of 4G, and thus it can be expected that the energy consumption of 6G may exceed that of 5G. As a result, considering the resource constraints, maintaining optimum performance in all aspects is superfluous for a practical communication system. As mentioned previously, 6G systems will be extended to support more abundant and various application scenarios. In addition to communication, 6G is expected to offer new services, e.g., digital twins, AI, computing, localization, and sensing. Since 6G has a wide range of applications but system resources are difficult to meet all the ultra-high performance demands simultaneously, the trade-offs of system performance metrics in each scenario and application are inevitable. In [138], the authors summarized the technical requirements in different 6G application scenarios, including feMBB, umMTC, euRLLC, and MBRLLC. For example, it was proposed that latency, jitter and reliability are more significant in euRLLC scenarios than peak rate and connectivity. The different requirements for KPIs appear in other 6G scenarios as well, and this is the theoretical foundation for analyzing the performance tradeoffs. In this survey paper, the 6G technical requirements for different application scenarios are summarized in Table VII. For technical requirements with existing quantitative ranges, e.g., data rate, latency, and connection density, we investigate the quantitative requirements of these KPIs in different application scenarios. Note that each type of scenario does not require all indicators to reach the extreme. So, we only provide quantitative specific values for these indicators with high attention. However, for the emerging security capacity and intelligence level that have not been quantitatively studied yet, we only provide qualitative importance measure. As can be seen, there are great differences between 6G requirements of KPIs in different application scenarios. For example, digital twins impose high demands on data rate, latency, area traffic capacity, connection density, positioning, resolution, and intelligence level. Extremely low-power communications require high level of connection density and energy efficiency. A similar but simplified table was proposed in [54] and the table listed different levels of demand for KPIs for different technologies. Hence, trade-offs between KPIs based on their intrinsic relationships and application scenarios have been a hot topic since 4G and many scholars have conducted research on this fundamental issue.Although 6G will have a step change in these 17 KPIs, the KPIs often cannot be improved simultaneously in the same system due to hardware impairments, actual propagation environment and other limitations [136].

        <p>Among all the KPIs, SE and EE have been the most concerned ones because every communication system upgrade is accompanied by a magnitude increase in these two metrics. For communication system operators, it is optimal to enhance both SE and EE. Unfortunately, in actual system deployment, EE decreases with SE enhancement, which means that it is essential to achieve the optimal operation points in terms of SE and EE for better overall performance [139]. In [140], [141], the trade-offs between SE and EE for the relay system were investigated while in [142] authors analyzed the same trade-off for RIS-aided system. Based on the trade-off between SE and EE, in [143] authors investigated power allocation in satellite-vehicular networks and the hybrid time division multiple access (TDMA) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system design was proposed in [144]. Furthermore, as a complementary KPI to SE and EE, cost efficiency has also received wide attention. The SE, cost efficiency, and their relationships were discussed for cellular networks in [145]. In [146], a quadrature space-frequency index modulation (IM) scheme was proposed and the SE-EE-cost efficiency-economic efficiency trade-off performance was investigated. An adaptive transmission scheme for integrated satellite-terrestrial networks was invented in [147] and the trade-off among SE, EE, symbol error rate, and economic efficiency based on the proposed scheme was analyzed.Among all the KPIs, SE and EE have been the most concerned ones because every communication system upgrade is accompanied by a magnitude increase in these two metrics.

The trade-offs for D2D communication and maritime wireless networks were analyzed in [150], [151]. Reliability, as one of the most focused KPIs, has similarly been extensively studied.

        <p>As to the trade-offs in different application scenarios, in [156] the authors analyzed the delay and error-rate performances and solved the delay-violation probability minimization problem for the muRLLC scenarios in 6G cell-free massive MIMO systems.

In short, the trade-offs between 6G KPIs for optimal system performance have been widely recognized and the research on SE, EE, capacity, reliability and other metrics has been fruitful.

        <p>With the continuous development of application requirements and technical requirements, the three major application scenarios in current 5G are expected to be enhanced and expanded in 6G. Novel application scenarios, such as digital twins, integration of communication, computing, and sensing, distributed AI applications, are also envisaged in 6G. These enhanced and novel application scenarios put forward higher requirements on the KPIs of the communication system. In addition to the significant enhancement of 5G KPIs, communication systems are also required to acquire new capabilities on positioning, sensing, imaging, intelligence level, etc., as shown in Fig. 4. It is difficult to improve these KPIs only by using new air interface technologies. Hence, it is necessary to revolutionize the entire communication network at the architecture level, to enable the network to provide diverse applications and reduce the cost and energy consumption.With the continuous development of application requirements and technical requirements, the three major application scenarios in current 5G are expected to be enhanced and expanded in 6G.

        <p>From 1G to 5G, the communication network architecture is developing in the direction of modularization, softwareization, virtualization, and cloudification. Key network architectures in 5G include the network slicing, network functions virtualization (NFV), software defined network (SDN), and servicebased architecture (SBA), making the network more flexible and bringing improvements in multiple aspects including application services and costs. However, there are still many challenges in deploying these network architectures in real networks. For the sake of application requirements, technical requirements, and cost considerations, the 6G network architecture will integrate novel network architectures and technologies on the basis of the further evolution of the 5G network architecture, moving towards the following five directions: 1) 3D multi-network integrated; 2) secure and trustworthy; 3) integration of communications, sensing, and computing; 4) green, flexible, and lightweight; 5) natively intelligent.

        <p>A. Further Evolution of the 5G Network Architecture 1) NFV: Traditional fixed hardware-based networks have high deployment cost and low network flexibility. NFV is a revolutionary network architecture that transforms fixed networks to software-based programmable networks. Its design concept is to decouple software and hardware [164]. With the help of virtualization technologies, multiple virtualized servers can be deployed on one or more physical hardware resources. Different servers can be configured on demand to execute different network functions, thus providing network support for diverse applications. Using the NFV to virtualize the network can significantly reduce the equipment, operation, and maintenance costs of hardware, improve the efficiency of network operation and management, shorten the development cycle of network services, and make the network flexible and scalable [52], [165]. The architecture of NFV mainly consists of three components, i.e., the NFV infrastructure (NFVI), the virtual network functions (VNFs), and the NFV management and orchestration (NFV-MANO) [52].A.

        <p>2) SDN: Different from decoupling software and hardware in NFV, the SDN is based on the idea of decoupling the control plane and the forwarding plane, aiming to separate network control functions from forwarding functions [52], [175], [176]. The SDN architecture mainly includes the application plane, control plane, and data (forwarding) plane [175]. In SDN, a software-defined logical network is abstracted on the physical network. Network control functions are centralized to the SDN controller which interfaces with upper-layer applications and instructs lower-layer network infrastructures that only retain forwarding functions to complete forwarding operations. SDN makes each layer relatively independent. This has a series of advantages, such as programmability, flexibility, low costs, and high efficiency [52], [54], [177].2) SDN: Different from decoupling software and hardware in NFV, the SDN is based on the idea of decoupling the control plane and the forwarding plane, aiming to separate network control functions from forwarding functions [52], [175], [176].

        <p>Since the concept of SDN was proposed, research on various aspects of SDN implementation and enhancement has made a lot of progress. Limited by the heterogeneity and complexity of optical devices, the transport network may be the last part to fully realize SDN. A comprehensive survey on the current status and future directions of transport SDN was given in [178]. SDN has also been studied to integrate with various other communication networks, e.g., smart grid communication [179], underwater wireless sensor networks [180], satellite networks [181], and vehicular networks [182]. In [177], the SDN was proposed to integrate with edge computing and blockchain to improve the efficiency and security of wireless network virtualization. As for more in-depth algorithm study, Das et al. [175] reviewed comprehensively on the SDN controller placement problem, which is a key network design consideration that affects network latency, resiliency, EE, and load balancing. The controller synchronization in distributed SDN was quantified and analyzed in [183]. In addition, the characteristics of logically centralized control, global view of the network, and dynamic resource allocation in SDN bring some opportunities to achieve the network intelligence. Xie et al. [184] provided an overview of research issues and challenges in applying ML technologies to SDN. Note that, while SDN has the advantages of programmability, flexibility and openness, it will also lead to new security issues that can be easily overlooked. A detailed review and analysis on typical security issues and solutions in SDN were conducted in [176] according to the STRIDE threat model [185]. Moreover, in order to take full advantage of SDN, the challenges of deploying SDN in 6G include switch forwarding schemes in hybrid SDN [186], service virtualization and flow management [187], energy-efficiency optimization [181], handover schemes [182] and freshness-aware age optimization [188] for multipath transmission control protocol (TCP) in SDNs.Since the concept of SDN was proposed, research on various aspects of SDN implementation and enhancement has made a lot of progress. Limited by the heterogeneity and complexity of optical devices, the transport network may be the last part to fully realize SDN. A comprehensive survey on the current status and future directions of transport SDN was given in [178].

        <p>3) SBA: With the development of mobile communications, in order to support various applications, the core network needs to perform more and more functions and become more and more complex. However, different applications may only require part of these network functions. Based on technologies including cloud computing, virtualization, and micro-services, the 5G core network adopts the SBA, which has been accepted by 3GPP [189]. The network elements providing each service are separate modules that are connected together to provide the services of the core network. Different service network functional modules are used for deployment according to the needs of application services. Note that SBA realizes the modularization of 5G core network functions in the form of service function chains by means of NFV. The reference SBA for 5G core network and details of the modular functions can be found in [52], [190], [191]. Similar to the design concept of decoupling control functions in SDN, 5G core network functions in SBA are divided into two classes, i.e., control plane functions and user plane functions (UPFs) [192]. In addition to the flexible and modular features originally brought by SBA, the architecture also inherits the advantages of underlying technologies [52], [193], including on-demand computing of cloud computing, flexible and efficient resource management of virtualization, flexibility, fine-grained property, and independent scalability of micro-services. The security concepts, techniques, and challenges in the SBA were discussed in [193]. In [194], the authors prototyped an SBA core network in an NFV environment and proposed a load balancing strategy that can significantly reduce the delay of the control plane.3) SBA: With the development of mobile communications, in order to support various applications, the core network needs to perform more and more functions and become more and more complex.

        <p>4) Network slicing: In the 5G era, the communication system has three scenarios: eMBB, uRLLC and mMTC. Network requirements of these scenarios are quite different. In order to support different application services, the communication network needs to be flexible enough to provide various services of high quality to the greatest extent while considering the cost. Taking these factors into consideration, the network slicing based on NFV, SDN, cloud and edge computing [197] emerged. The core concept of the network slicing is to multiplex independent logical networks virtualized on the same physical network infrastructure to support different application services [52], [198], [199]. In addition to services to customers (ToC) directly, 5G network slices offer a range of services to business (ToB), such as cloud games, power, medical, ports, and industry. So far, there have been several surveys [197]- [201] on state-of-art network slicing. For instance, the authors of [198] reviewed the current network slicing research in terms of taxonomy, requirements, and research challenges. Debbabi et al. [199] investigated the architecture of network slicing and focused on the analysis and overview from the perspective of algorithms.4) Network slicing: In the 5G era, the communication system has three scenarios: eMBB, uRLLC and mMTC.

        <p>In the future, the network slicing will mainly develop further in three directions. Firstly, research interests are focusing on implementing holistic E2E network slicing systems. In [202], a next-generation wireless communication network architecture containing slices at three levels: cloud, RAN, and application level, was proposed. Khan et al. [203] proposed an E2E network slicing framework including RAN and core network slicing for 5G vehicular Ad-Hoc networks. The authors of [204] investigated an E2E network slicing system architecture including RAN, transport network, and core network. The software simulation and real hardware demo of the proposed architecture were also demonstrated in [204]. Secondly, specialized/tailored network slicing is also one of the directions of evolution. It was envisioned in [48] that with further development of slicing and virtualization in the future, network slices can become highly specialized. More specifically, Cao et al. [205] proposed the TailoredSlice-6G algorithm, which can realize the tailored resource allocation of slices in 6G networks to provide tailored slices. In [206], a two-level soft customized RAN slicing scheme was proposed, which can satisfy QoS requirements of uRLLC and eMBB services simultaneously. Lastly, there is a growing research interest in achieving intelligent network slicing using AI [207], digital twins [208], and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) [209]- [211]. In [207], an AI-assisted next-generation RAN functional architecture based on network slicing was proposed, with AIassisted network topology, network protocol, and resource management. Based on a new graph neural network model, Wang et al. [208] proposed a scalable digital twin of network slicing which can accurately reflect the network behavior, predict E2E slice performance in unknown environments, and provide intelligent network slicing management. The authors of [209] proposed a novel hierarchical DRL framework that incorporated the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and the double deep Q-network algorithm to maximize the long-term QoS of services and the SE of network slices. In [210] and [211], the DRL was explored to adaptively learn optimal slicing strategies and find optimal resource allocation strategies, respectively. In addition, challenges such as slice isolation, dynamic slice creation and management [52], and multi-tenant networks [212] are also research topics that have attracted great interest in network slicing. It can be expected that various application network slices in the future will lead to a qualitative leap in our lives.In the future, the network slicing will mainly develop further in three directions.

        <p>2) Secure and trustworthy: While it is critical to innovate the network architecture to meet requirements of various applications in the 6G communication network, security and trustworthiness are also important aspects that cannot be ignored. On one hand, the fusion of communication technologies with data technologies and industrial operation technologies, as well as the marginalization and virtualization of facilities will lead to a more blurred 6G network security boundary. Therefore, the traditional security trust model can no longer meet the requirements of the 6G security and trustworthiness [32]. On the other hand, with the change of the network architecture and the emergence of new services and new terminals, 6G networks will face novel security threats [30], [52], e.g., the data privacy issue, security risks of models and algorithms, as well as software or system vulnerabilities. The new 6G network architecture should be based on a more inclusive multilateral trust model, taking security issues into consideration at the beginning of the network design, to achieve the endogenous security and trustworthiness.2) Secure and trustworthy: While it is critical to innovate the network architecture to meet requirements of various applications in the 6G communication network, security and trustworthiness are also important aspects that cannot be ignored.

However, the requirements and importance of security in different application scenarios are usually different. Porambage et al. [106] summarized the key requirements for security in major 6G applications comprehensively. The diversity of 6G scenarios makes the traditional security trust model face many challenges. It is necessary to establish a multilateral trust model to cover the trustworthiness in different situations, and to endogenously carry a more robust, smarter, and scalable security mechanism [27], [32]. A network that supports multilateral trust includes three modes of trust models: bridge, consensus, and endorsement. The core of multilateral trust is the decentralized consensus of all parties, including the mode of centralized authorization bridge and third-party endorsement. A detailed introduction of the three trust models can be found in [27].

        <p>Safe and reliable network architecture: In Fig. 7, we have summarized the evolution and development direction of the 6G network architecture in multiple aspects. It is worth noting that the evolving communication network architecture is also facing novel security threats. In [106], the authors analyzed the security threats in several potential 6G network architectures including RAN-core convergence, intelligent network management and scheduling, edge intelligence, and specialized 6G networks. While designing the 6G network architecture, potential 6G security technologies are introduced to ensure the network security, such as blockchain technologies [225], [226], quantum communications [227], and physical layer security technologies [228]. The implementation of standardized open network interfaces with high modularity in O-RAN also provides some new ideas for improving network security [229]. The network security will gradually evolve from traditional security protection to the endogenous security with self-adaptive, autonomous and self-growing security capabilities [30]. The basic concepts, problems, properties, structures, and functional applications were introduced in [230]. Moreover, Wang et al. [231] analyzed and applied the endogenous security principle from both theoretical and simulation perspectives. In addition to challenges of security technologies, the integrated evolution design of security architecture and network architecture is also the key to realizing an endogenous secure and reliable network architecture [32].

        <p>Currently, several prospective studies have been initialized on this topic. In [234], [235], China Mobile and China Unicom have carried out conceptual research on the computing network. Based on cloud-fog-edge collaborative networking, Refat et al. [236] proposed a flexible mobile grammar teaching tool. In [237], the performance evaluation and optimization of three-layer cloud-fog-edge computing infrastructure were investigated based on queuing theory. A mobility-driven realtime cloud-fog-edge collaboration framework was proposed in [233], which can efficiently deliver processed information to user devices based on user mobility prediction and intelligent decision-making. Furthermore, research problems in the computing network have also aroused interests. In order to achieve better resource allocation in the computing network, the authors of [238] proposed a bandwidth allocation method based on utility optimization. The sleep mechanism of base stations was studied in [239], while the joint cloudedge computing model was used to improve the system computing performance. In addition, the ITU-T study group 13 adopted the standard ITU-T-Y.2501 [240], defining the computing power network framework and architecture. At present, the industry is transforming from the division scheme to the collaboration scheme of computing and networks, and is integrating computing and networks [32]. It is worth noting that there are still many challenges in multi-layer ubiquitous computing networks [30], including theoretical research on cloud-fog-edge computing, demand for computing resources in different scenarios, and perception and measurement of computing powers, as well as the computing network operation management and control, multi-party cooperation, and operation mode from the perspective of real network deployment.Currently, several prospective studies have been initialized on this topic. In [234], [235], China Mobile and China Unicom have carried out conceptual research on the computing network. Based on cloud-fog-edge collaborative networking, Refat et al. [236] proposed a flexible mobile grammar teaching tool. In [237], the performance evaluation and optimization of three-layer cloud-fog-edge computing infrastructure were investigated based on queuing theory. A mobility-driven realtime cloud-fog-edge collaboration framework was proposed in [233], which can efficiently deliver processed information to user devices based on user mobility prediction and intelligent decision-making. Furthermore, research problems in the computing network have also aroused interests. In order to achieve better resource allocation in the computing network, the authors of [238] proposed a bandwidth allocation method based on utility optimization. The sleep mechanism of base stations was studied in [239], while the joint cloudedge computing model was used to improve the system computing performance. In addition, the ITU-T study group 13 adopted the standard ITU-T-Y.2501 [240], defining the computing power network framework and architecture.

        <p>Cell-free/less architecture: Since 5G, the performance of the communication system has been greatly limited by the boundary effect of the traditional cellular architecture, which refers to the phenomenon of poor communication quality and strong interference from other users at the edge of the cell. The traditional cellular network structure requires complex coprocessing and high deployment costs, which makes current technologies extremely limited in their ability to mitigate boundary effects. In addition, issues such as load balancing, interference management, and handover overhead, are also thorny problems in traditional cellular architectures [52]. To address these challenges, cell-free (or cell-less) network architecture with massive MIMO was proposed and quickly became the focus of research [244]- [255]. A similar user-centric no cell architecture has been shown in 2016 by HUAWEI [256]. In the cell-free network architecture, areas are no longer divided based on cellular grids. Massive MIMO antenna arrays and access points are geographically distributed in a large area and controlled by unified central processing units (CPUs), jointly serving user terminals with the same resources. The cell-free massive MIMO architecture is promising in nextgeneration systems due to its high network coverage, low cost, high macro-diversity gain, low path loss, as well as huge SE and EE [52], [246].Cell-free/less architecture: Since 5G, the performance of the communication system has been greatly limited by the boundary effect of the traditional cellular architecture, which refers to the phenomenon of poor communication quality and strong interference from other users at the edge of the cell.

        <p>Since the cell-free architecture was proposed in [244], research has been widely conducted to validate its advantages. In [257], the authors analyzed the SE and EE for cell-free massive MIMO system and the results demonstrated that the cell-free architecture would provide the same QoS in a greener way. A similar conclusion was also revealed in [258]. Moreover, due to the fact that cellular-free networks serve users through access points, the network deployment could be more flexible [245], [255]. As a result, its potential advantages have led to a large number of studies on cellfree networks in recent years. Focusing on the impact of hardware impairments, Papazafeiropoulos et al. [247] investigated the performance of scalable cell-free systems with low computational complexity. The effects of phase drifts and noise in non-ideal hardware on cell-free systems were studied in [248]. In order to improve the transmission reliability in dynamic cell-free massive MIMO networks, the authors of [249] proposed a learning-based energy-delay-aware power control strategy. Ye et al. [250] studied channel estimation methods in cell-free systems, and proposed a high-precision channel covariance matrix estimation scheme with fingerprintbased localization. In addition to theoretical studies in cell-free systems, researches have also focused on the integration of cell-free networks with other technologies. In [251], Datta et al. proposed and analyzed full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO systems that can take full throughput and EE advantages of full-duplex communications. Based on cell-free massive MIMO networks, a novel federated learning framework in wireless environments was proposed in [252]. So far, the cellfree architecture has been applied to many new communication scenarios, including mmWave communications [253], VLC [259], satellite and UAV communications [260], and communications in indoor factory environments [254]. To make the cellfree/less architecture into reality, there are still many issues to be explored.

        <p>RAN-Core convergence: Currently, the core functions of the communication network are becoming decentralized, while higher-level RAN functions are becoming centralized. In order to make the 6G network more lightweight and flexible, the Bell Labs [48], [261] proposed a novel network architecture concept of RAN-Core convergence, which means that part of the RAN architecture (centralized high-level RAN) and part of the core network (sinking edge core network) can be unified to a single entity. On one hand, the complexity of the network and the cost of transmission can be reduced. On the other hand, the scalability of the network elements on the RAN side will be increased. Note that issues such as network decomposition in the RAN-Core converged network architecture and the coordination of protocol suites between different networks require further study [48].RAN-Core convergence: Currently, the core functions of the communication network are becoming decentralized, while higher-level RAN functions are becoming centralized.

        <p>Fully-decoupled RAN architecture: From 4G to 5G, the architecture of the core network has been designed to separate the control plane from the user plane, which could improve the flexibility of the network. However, on the RAN side of 5G, each base station still needs to be equipped with control functions and functions in the user plane (e.g., data transmission functions) [262]. So, there is still room for network architecture optimization. In [192], [262], a novel architecture that fully decouples the RAN side was proposed, and its advantages in terms of EE, reliability, mobility, and flexibility were discussed. In the fully-decoupled RAN architecture, base stations are divided into control base stations and data base stations, which perform control and data transmission functions separately. Control base stations are usually macro cell base stations with a large range, while data base stations are micro-cell base stations. By multiplexing the second generation (2G)/3G network infrastructure or spectrum resources, terminals can transmit control signals through low-frequency control channels and control base stations, which improves spectrum utilization and makes network more flexible. Besides, the design concept of this architecture also takes the resource allocation and power consumption into account. Note that full decoupling is not achieved only by separating control base stations and data base stations. The data base stations for uplink and downlink transmission are completely separated. In this way, control base stations can coordinate spectrum resources more accurately, and the interference between users will also be reduced. In addition, separating the uplink and downlink base stations and deploying fewer downlink base stations to serve larger areas can reduce the power consumption of the network and terminals, which can make the network greener and more energy efficient. Details about the design concept of the fully decoupled RAN architecture can be found in [192]. Recently, Zhao et al. [263] investigated the uplink joint base station reception issue in the fully decoupled RAN architecture, and designed an effective parallel uplink base station selection strategy based on SE maximization. However, the current research on the fully decoupled RAN architecture is still in the early stage.Fully-decoupled RAN architecture: From 4G to 5G, the architecture of the core network has been designed to separate the control plane from the user plane, which could improve the flexibility of the network.

The 5G core network has added the network data analysis function (NWDAF), which improves the data collection and analysis capabilities of the network. However, due to limited data sources, lack of data privacy protection and support for external AI services, the NWDAF cannot provide native AI support for the network.

        <p>Cognitive service architecture: From 5G to 6G, diverse application scenarios have emerged. This means changing service scenarios, personalized user needs, and changing business requirements. These factors, in turn, require 6G networks to be flexible enough. Although the modular 5G core network with the SBA can be deployed using different network modules based on the needs of services, the SBA in the 5G core network uses rough configuration and lacks real-time sensing and dynamic adaptability to changes in service requirements [52]. In [52], a novel cognitive service architecture, which has two main features, i.e., the ability to accurately identify target behaviors, scene semantics and user characteristics, as well as the unified service description method, was proposed. More recently, the design concept and implementation details of the cognitive service architecture were described in detail in [266]. In order to realize the cognitive function of the network, traditional network services are upgraded to cognitive services, and real-time perception and AI reasoning capabilities are added in addition to basic network functions. On one hand, the upgraded SBA can perceive network status such as the request flow, resource and topology status, and operation and maintenance events in real time. On the other hand, the intelligent ability of AI can be used to realize the online feature matching and local reasoning functions of the network. The updating of the cognitive capabilities of network functions and interfaces is accomplished by updating the knowledge graph of cognitive services. In addition, in the cognitive service architecture, AI is also introduced to enable the intelligent resource scheduling function module for the 6G core network to improve the overall performance of the network. More details about the cognitive service architecture can be found in [266]. Especially, in addition to investigating the design concept of the cognitive service architecture, Li et al. [266] also conducted a case study of the cognitive service architecture through the session establishment process. The results illustrated that the cognitive service architecture can improve the performance of the system by simplifying the process of network function interaction with the knowledge graph of network services. In order to realize the cognitive service architecture, it is necessary to focus on various enabling technologies such as unified network semantics, polymorphic interfaces supporting cognitive services, service continuity assurance, and general platforms for the computing network integration.Cognitive service architecture: From 5G to 6G, diverse application scenarios have emerged.

The widely recognized design concept of the digital twin-based network architecture refers to a virtual digital twin network that is constructed on the real physical network, and they are interactively mapped in real time. The twin network realizes the mapping and control of the physical network through closed-loop simulation and optimization. The digital twin network can provide guidance for the deployment, management, and operation of the real 6G network, and improve the autonomy and automation level of the 6G network [32], [273], [274].</p>
        <p>The digital twin-based network architecture has attracted much attention, and a large number of studies have emerged in recent years. In [262], [275], the authors proposed a cybertwinbased network architecture in which digital cybertwins of the end users hosted at the edge of the network can offer three major functions: communication assistance, network behavior logs, and digital asset ownership. On the basis of this work, Li et al. [276] investigated the joint virtual network topology design and embedding in the cybertwin-based 6G core networks. To facilitate user-centric networking, Shen et al. [60] proposed a digital-twin-based network architecture integrating network slicing and AI. This framework could achieve fine-grain and flexible network management. In [277], a virtual digital twin instance of a physical network was established to capture the dependencies between anomalies and faults in NFV environments in real time. The simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness and advantage of digital twins to assist in analyzing root causes of anomalies in NFV environments. Naeem et al. [278] used the digital twin to assist in the optimal allocation of network slice resources. They utilized graphs to build digital twins of network slices and tried to use graph neural networks to learn complex relationships of network slices. The network state based on the digital twin can finally be forwarded to the deep distributed Q network proposed in [278] to learn the optimal network slicing strategy. In addition, some other works focused on issues in digital twin-assisted edge networks, such as the application of digital twins in the offloading of intelligent computing tasks of IoT devices and the selection of mobile edge servers [279], [280], the communication efficiency and data privacy protection of digital twin edge networks [281], and the optimization issues on edge association [282], [283].The digital twin-based network architecture has attracted much attention, and a large number of studies have emerged in recent years.

        <p>It can be seen that the current research on digital twins in 6G networks is still at the preliminary stage, mainly involving the application of digital twins in certain parts of the 6G network. Due to the complexity of the 6G network, the research on the holistic 6G network architecture using the digital twin is indeed a very huge and complicated task. It is worth noting that while the digital twin accelerates the development of 6G networks, the construction of a real-time digital twin network system also has higher requirements on the data rate, reliability, delay, and other KPIs of the network. Therefore, the 6G network and the digital twin will integrate, promote each other, and develop together.It can be seen that the current research on digital twins in 6G networks is still at the preliminary stage, mainly involving the application of digital twins in certain parts of the 6G network.

        <p>First of all, with the development of computing, storage, and other technologies, the 6G network will become more intelligent, flexible, efficient, and ubiquitous. Cloud, fog, and edge computing will be dependent and complementary to each other, providing the networks with on-demand real-time scheduling and efficient sharing computing resources, which are essential to AI technologies. Based on this, an integrated multi-layer and hierarchical intelligent network, including a network intelligent cloud platform and data-driven edge intelligent centers is expected to form. Among them, the fog computing acts as a bridge, connecting the centralized cloud and distributed edge networks. The mobile edge computing (sinking of network functions) in 5G will continue to evolve, making the 6G network decentralized. Edge intelligent centers will support a series of communication networks. The cell-free architecture integrated with ultra-massive MIMO antennas will break the boundary effect in traditional cellular architectures, and bring a series of improvements to the network, including the SE and EE. Interestingly, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has the ability to actively control the wireless channel, which will be introduced detailedly in Section V-C2. It has great potential for coverage enhancement and capacity improvement of future wireless networks. The communication densities in various application scenarios are gradually increasing, and the 6G network will be an UDHN. In addition, full spectra resources including mmWave, THz, and VLC will be deeply exploited and utilized to build a variety of networks to serve full coverage scenarios, i.e., space-air-groundsea integrated networks [284]. In particular, several RAN-Core converged edge computing centers which integrate highlevel RAN functions with partially sinking edge functions, can reduce the delay of transmission and can better support applications with low latency requirements, such as automatic driving and telemedicine. In the 6G network architecture, the RAN side will be further decoupled and the control plane of the base station will be further separated from the user plane, so that network resources can be used more flexibly and efficiently.First of all, with the development of computing, storage, and other technologies, the 6G network will become more intelligent, flexible, efficient, and ubiquitous.

        <p>Three orders of magnitude larger spectrum resources are available in the optical bands than the RF bands. However, the utilization of spectrum resources is significantly limited by the electrical bandwidth of optoelectronic devices. In recent years, the development of high performance optoelectronic devices has been a topic of great interest in optical wireless research. Exceptionally fast organic light emitting diode (OLED) with bandwidth of hundreds of MHz were designed and applied in VLC systems, achieving data rates of over 1 Gbps [357]. A silicon photomultiplier was shown to achieve a bit error rate (BER) of 10 -3 at a data rate of 3.45 Gbps [358]. Channel measurements and modeling are crucial for OWC channels understanding and link design. A comprehensive review of OWC channel research was published in 2018 [293]. OWC channel is not isotropic. Therefore, it is essential to consider the effect of device orientation on the channel gain [359], [360]. In order to prevail over the effect of random orientation and blockage, multi-directional transmitter with adaptive spatial modulation was proposed in [359]. It was suggested that time domain spatial modulation would be a feasible option for next-generation orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based optical spatial modulation [361]. A NOMA scheme for the beam steering and user clustering scenario was proposed to exploit the space diversity of VLC systems, and it can provide 10 Mbps sum rate gain for each NOMA user pair [362].

        <p>The unique characteristics and requirements of application scenarios need to be considered when designing waveforms, which are closely related to the performance of the communication system. During the development of the 5G standard, multi-carrier systems, which have high SE but also a high peak-to-average ratio, such as OFDM, are mainly used. More existing waveforms are detailed in [27]. In order to flexibly adapt to the possible application scenarios of the 6G communication system, new waveform designs are expected to provide better performance in a targeted manner. Compared with low frequency, the potential high frequency scenarios of 6G lead to more challenges, such as large transmission path loss and the need for efficient high-frequency broadband power amplifiers. In [373], a single-carrier system with low peak to average power ratio (PAPR) was studied to address these challenges. For high mobility scenarios, waveforms in transform domain, such as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), can describe information such as delay and doppler more accurately [298]. As for high throughput scenarios, systems such as spectrally efficient frequency domain multiplexing (SEFDM) [299] and overlapped x domain multiplexing (OVXDM) [374] can be used to obtain higher SE.

        <p>2) New coding: Efficient channel coding technology can improve the capacity, reliability and quality of the services in the communication systems. Guided by Shannon's theory, error-correcting codes (ECCs) realize a leap from algebraic coding to probabilistic coding, which had great success in improving the capacity, reliability, and quality of service in communication systems [302]. By introducing randomness and sparsity in coding and propagating soft messages based on factor graphs in decoding, advanced probabilistic codes can approach or even achieve the Shannon limit. Among them, the most representative ECCs are Turbo codes [375], low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes [376], and polar codes [377], which are the standard codes for 4G data channels, 5G data channels, and 5G control channels, respectively. Though their de-facto decoding algorithms and implementations are different [303], they are all derived based on Bayes' theorem and competitive for 6G ultra-high speed and ultra-low power consumption requirements, which impel a unified decoding framework for complex and variable scenarios in 6G communication systems.2) New coding: Efficient channel coding technology can improve the capacity, reliability and quality of the services in the communication systems.

        <p>As linear block codes, the three ECCs can be decoded by a belief propagation (BP) decoder that employs the famous sumproduct algorithm on a bipartite Tanner factor graph [378] but is only beneficial to LDPC codes due to their high sparsity. By adding auxiliary state variables in the factor graph, the sum-product algorithm becomes the Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek, and Raviv (BCJR) algorithm for Turbo codes [378], [379], which propagates messages on trellis graphs in both forward and backward directions. With belief pushing in a successive message-passing schedule, the BP decoder evolves to the classical successive cancellation (SC) decoder for polar codes [380], with which polar codes are proved to achieve Shannon capacity when the code length is infinite [377]. Limited by 5G control channels, the rate of channel polarization degrades for finite code lengths, and neither SC nor BP decoding can meet the performance requirement. The increase of codeword search space is necessary, which results in algorithms such as SC list/flip [381], [382], and BP list/flip decoding [383], [384]. Though originated from the same decoding rule, the encoding schemes of Turbo, LDPC, and polar codes can be further enhanced, such as the generator polynomial of Turbo codes [385] and the information set of polar codes [386], thus facilitating the unified decoding factor graphs and simplified decoding algorithms to improve the EE of the decoder in 6G. The approximation for exponential operations in message-passing has promoted the circuit realization of these three ECC decoders, which results in the windowed Max-log-BCJR decoder for 4G LTE Turbo codes [387], adaptive min-sum-BP decoder for 5G NR LDPC codes [388], and node-based SC decoder for 5G NR polar codes [389]. A uniform design of ECCs at the circuit level is a key technology of 6G, such as Turbo/LDPC decoders [390] and LDPC/Polar decoders [391]. Driven by ultra-low latency and ultra-reliability of 6G communication systems, a short code length will be adopted for ECCs, where the randomness, sparsity, and channel polarization of the above three ECCs are debilitated, thus degrading the good performance of their de-facto decoding algorithms. One alternative approach is to employ the near-maximum likelihood decoding schemes for classical algebraic coding, which are also uniform schemes for any linear block codes, such as ordered statistics decoding (OSD) [392] and the recently proposed capacityachieving guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) [393]. Another promising solution for short-length scenarios is to use concatenated codes, like Arıkan's new polarizationadjusted convolutional (PAC) codes [394].

NOMA actively introduces interference information at the transmitter side and demodulates it using a successive interference cancellation receiver.

        <p>As one of the key technologies for 5G, the initial idea of massive MIMO was first proposed by Marzetta from Bell Labs in 2009 [402] and has received much attention because of its ability to improve the SE significantly. When the number of antennas serving each user is greater than 10, it can be considered as massive MIMO. In 6G, larger antenna arrays will be exploited, using hundreds or even thousands of antennas, which is known as ultra-massive MIMO. It has the ability to achieve higher SE and EE, wider and more flexible network coverage, and higher positioning accuracy in more diverse frequency range [306]. Ultra-massive MIMO has an exciting application prospect because of its unique characteristics. Firstly, further expansion of the antenna scale can provide spatial beams with very high spatial resolution and processing gain, thus improving the multiplexing capability and interference suppression of the network. It is promising to improve SE and reduce energy consumption of the system. Besides, the ultra-massive MIMO array has the ability to adjust beams in three dimensions, thus can provide nonterrestrial coverage. What's more, the ultra-massive MIMO array has extremely high spatial resolution, which can improve positioning accuracy in complicated wireless communication environments and achieve accurate 3D positioning.As one of the key technologies for 5G, the initial idea of massive MIMO was first proposed by Marzetta from Bell Labs in 2009 [402] and has received much attention because of its ability to improve the SE significantly. When the number of antennas serving each user is greater than 10, it can be considered as massive MIMO. In 6G, larger antenna arrays will be exploited, using hundreds or even thousands of antennas, which is known as ultra-massive MIMO. It has the ability to achieve higher SE and EE, wider and more flexible network coverage, and higher positioning accuracy in more diverse frequency range [306]. Ultra-massive MIMO has an exciting application prospect because of its unique characteristics. Firstly, further expansion of the antenna scale can provide spatial beams with very high spatial resolution and processing gain, thus improving the multiplexing capability and interference suppression of the network.

        <p>In summary, important issues and trends in ultra-massive MIMO are listed as follows. 1) With the further increase of the antenna scale, the near-field effect and wideband effect will be more prominent. The approximation of plane wavefront no longer holds and the spherical wavefront needs to be considered due to the utilization of large antenna arrays [343]. The spatial-and frequency-wideband effects lead to the channel sparsity in the angle domain and the delay domain [403]. For the near-field and wideband effects, plenty of research has been conducted in the fields of channel modeling, channel estimation, beam assignment, codebook design, and beam training [404]- [406]; 2) In order to utilize more abundant spectrum resources, ultra-massive MIMO is expected to utilize higher frequency bands, such as mmWave and THz. For ultramassive MIMO in higher frequency bands, research is being carried out, focusing on integrated circuit design, channel characteristics, modulation techniques and so on [344], [407], [408]; 3) In addition to the traditional centralized active antenna array, ultra-massive MIMO is expected to take a more flexible and diverse approach for implementation. By using RIS (which will be introduced later), instead of traditional active antennas, network coverage, multi-user capacity, and signal strength can be significantly improved [409]- [411]; 4) The distributed ultra-massive antenna system can deploy a large number of distributed antennas over a wide geographical area to build cell-free network, which is conducive to achieving consistent user experience, obtaining high SE, and reducing the transmission energy consumption of the system [307], [308], [412]; 5) The introduction of AI for ultramassive MIMO technology helps to achieve intelligence in multiple aspects such as channel estimation, channel sounding, beam management, and user detection. How to meet real-time requirements and obtain training data needs to be addressed [413], [414]; 6) Ultra-massive MIMO is also expected to be combined with space-air-ground-sea integrated networks. It will bring great performance gain for a series of expanded application scenarios such as satellite communications [415], skywave communications [416], and underwater acoustic communications [417].In summary, important issues and trends in ultra-massive MIMO are listed as follows. 1) With the further increase of the antenna scale, the near-field effect and wideband effect will be more prominent.

        <p>OAM is an inherent physical quantity of EM waves. It is a dimension in addition to frequency, phase and space, providing a new dimension for modulation in wireless communications. EM waves with OAM, also known as vortex EM waves, have an angular momentum phase wavefront instead of the traditional plane wavefront.

        <p>OAM technology has huge potential to provide high data rates service in free-space optical, optical fiber, radio communications, as well as acoustic communication systems [311], [429]. In addition, the combination of OAM and MIMO communication is promising to achieve higher capacity and SE [27], which can be classified into two types [430]. One is that the signal is transmitted from OAM antennas and received by conventional antennas, and vice versa. The diversity of OAM modes is utilized to decrease spatial correlation function, thus increasing capacity and SE. Theoretical and numerial results proved that the OAM-based MIMO system equals to the conventional MIMO system with larger element spacing, making it possible to bring higher SE [431]. In [432], an OAM-based MIMO communication system with two OAM modes was proposed and its throughput was improved upon traditional MIMO by up to 30.50%. The performance of this kind of OAM-based MIMO system in the multipath scenario was analyzed in [433]. It was found that in the small angular spread scenario, the capacity of OAM-based MIMO system was superior to that of the conventional MIMO system. Another is that the signal is transmitted and received both by OAM antennas. The most common OAM antenna configuration is the uniform circular array (UCA). Although the UCA-based OAM is a subset of the conventional MIMO [434] and thus its SE is still constrained by the upper bound of MIMO, it has low complexity and is effective in the lineof-sight (LoS) scenario due to orthogonality between OAM modes compared with the conventional MIMO system. Y. Yagi et al. [435] demonstrated over 200 Gbps transmission using a dual-polarized OAM-based MIMO multiplexing with UCAs. Besides, OAM multiplexing can be combined with other multiplexing technologies. T. Hu et al.

        <p>AI will bring a disruptive change to the traditional air interface design. In the physical layer, AI is employed in wireless channel research to enable the modeling and prediction of complicated channels based on a large number of propagation environment parameters [323], [459], [460]. Due to the high computational complexity of conventional channel estimation techniques, there are many efforts attempting to perform channel estimation and signal detection utilizing AI [461], [462]. Besides, AI can also be applied to E2E transceiver design [463], [464], channel encoding and decoding techniques [465], [466], as well as modulation and waveform design [467], [468]. AI has the ability to efficiently extract and express large dimensional feature space. Therefore, its application in the field of MIMO technology, where the antenna dimension has grown significantly, has also received a lot of attention [469], [470]. In the medium access control (MAC) layer, AI is widely used for active user detection [471], [472], access control [473], and wireless link scheduling [474]. In addition, MAC protocols are expected to be designed automatically thanks to recent developments in deep multiagent reinforcement learning [475].

        <p>Semantic communication is a communication method in which semantic information is extracted from a source and encoded for transmission in a noisy channel. Rather than requiring error-free transmission at the bit level, semantic communication relies primarily on building a semantic knowledge base that is pervasive and comprehensible among a large number of human users and machines. It is expected to break through the bottleneck of transmission in classical communication systems and liberate communication networks from the traditional architecture based on data protocols and formats. Semantic communication is promising to further improve communication efficiency and reliability, enhance the quality of human-oriented services, and realize the true seamless intelligent connection of everything [265], [501].Semantic communication is a communication method in which semantic information is extracted from a source and encoded for transmission in a noisy channel.

The most important category is devices that harvest RF power, either from specific power transmitters or from ambient signals. Typically, these devices comprise a capacitor that is charged by the incoming RF field and communicate via backscattering. With backscattering, there is no RF chain, but the devices modulate the load impedance of their antenna to change the backscattered field; this change is then detected by the network node communicating with the device [339], [516]- [521]. From an electronics viewpoint, a load-modulated backscattering antenna is similar to an atom in a RIS (see Section V-C2).Passive (energy-neutral) devices rely on power harvested from the ambient environment to support their operation.

        <p>One of the main challenges with backscattering communication is the link budget. With β being the path gain from the network node to the device, the total path gain from the network node to the device and back scales as β 2 . To overcome the high path loss, either a directional antenna must be used (at the network node and/or the device), or one must rely on antenna arrays at the network side [338], [522]- [524]. Massive MIMO, the core physical-layer technology in 5G and 6G, enables an array gain proportional to the number of antennas both in receive and transmit mode. When operating in reciprocity-based (TDD) mode, this scaling holds even with estimated channels [525]. Exploiting this insight, massive MIMO technology is viewed as a fundamental enabler for communication with backscattering devices and technology is currently being developed, for example, in the European H2020-REINDEER project [12]. Another challenge is the cost. More devices are deployed in large scale so that the overall cost will be magnified if the individual device takes on a high cost.One of the main challenges with backscattering communication is the link budget.

The latest developments will be introduced as follows.</p>
        <p>1) 6G Pervasive Channel Simulator: Channel simulators aim to simulate the propagation characteristics of real channel environments by using different channel models. The most critical issue for 6G channel modeling is to fully consider the characteristics of 6G all-spectra and all-scenario channels. A pervasive 6G wireless channel modeling theory was proposed by Wang et al. in [531]. Using a unified channel modeling framework and method, the pervasive 6G wireless channel modeling theory adopts a unified channel impulse responses (CIR) expression and comprehensively considers integrating statistical properties of 6G channels for all spectra and all scenarios. Based on this, a 6G pervasive channel model applicable to 6G all-spectra and all-scenarios is constructed to accurately reflect the characteristics of different channels. In Fig. 10, the 6G pervasive wireless channel modeling theory is illustrated, which can be used to guide the construction of standardized 6G channel models. In terms of channel modeling framework and method, non-predictive models such as the geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) and ray tracing (RT), as well as AI/ML-based predictive models can be adopted. 5G and previous standardized channel models such as 3GPP TR 38.901 and IMT-2020 mostly adopt the GBSM modeling method. It is expected that the standardized 6G channel models will mainly adopt the GBSM modeling method for the same reasons, while RT and AI/ML modeling methods can be used for individual frequency bands and scenarios as supplements.1) 6G Pervasive Channel Simulator: Channel simulators aim to simulate the propagation characteristics of real channel environments by using different channel models.

        <p>Guided by the 6G pervasive channel modeling theory, a 6G pervasive channel model (6GPCM) based on a GBSM framework was first proposed in [531]. It aims to construct a benchmark for 6G pervasive GBSM, which is expected to serve as a pioneer in the exploration of 6G standardized channel models. The proposed model is generally suitable for all spectra including sub-6 GHz, mmWave, THz, IR and VLC, global-coverage scenarios including low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite, UAV, and maritime communication, and fullapplication scenarios such as ultra-massive MIMO, IIoT, and RIS channels in 6G communication systems. Parameter database for all spectra and scenarios can be constructed by using channel measurement fitting from existing standardized channel model documents. Considering the cost and limitations of channel measurements, RT and AI/ML-based methods can also be chosen to achieve channel parameter acquisition for different spectra and scenarios to complete the channel model parameter database. By adjusting the parameters of the channel model, the 6GPCM can be simplified to simulate channels for specific spectra and scenarios as special cases. By analyzing the 6GPCM, the complex mapping relationship among channel model parameters, channel characteristics and communication system performance can be investigated thoroughly. The 6GPCM is extremely important for the standardization of 6G channel models, as well as the investigation of theories, technologies, and system integration for the 6G space-air-ground-sea integrated network.Guided by the 6G pervasive channel modeling theory, a 6G pervasive channel model (6GPCM) based on a GBSM framework was first proposed in [531].

        <p>2) Channel Sounders: As a way to actively recognize channels, channel sounders are of great importance for establishing 6G all-spectra, global-coverage, and full-applications standardized channel models. A channel sounder is usually composed of a Tx, a Rx, and a data acquisition unit, which is a channel measurement platform to exploit the characteristics of unknown propagation environments [532]. In order to evaluate the performance of channel sounders, some key properties are defined, e.g., bandwidth, delay range, channel snapshot (CS) repetition rate, and dynamic range [533]. First, the bandwidth and delay resolution are reciprocals of each other. The larger the bandwidth is, the higher the delay resolution will be, but usually the higher the cost or complexity of equipment as well. Second, the delay range refers to the maximum propagation distance detected by the channel sounder in the dynamic range. In general, the delay range required for indoor scenarios is relatively small, about a few hundred nanoseconds, while many microseconds for outdoor scenarios. Third, the CS repetition rate is an important indicator of channel measurements in mobile scenarios. Based on the Nyquist sampling theorem, the signal can be recovered perfectly when the sampling rate is higher than twice of the signal bandwidth. The bandwidth of a mobile channel equals to the maximum Doppler frequency, so the CS repetition rate needs to be greater than twice the maximum Doppler frequency. Last, the dynamic range is calculated by the difference between the strongest identifiable multipath component (MPC) power and the noise floor [534]. The dynamic range can be improved by averaging over many CSs and increasing the length of probe waveform.2) Channel Sounders: As a way to actively recognize channels, channel sounders are of great importance for establishing 6G all-spectra, global-coverage, and full-applications standardized channel models.

        <p>According to channel measurement frequency, channel sounders can be divided into sub-6 GHz, mmWave, THz, and OWC channel sounders. In [535], a time domain channel sounder was used to conduct channel measurement at 3.5 GHz in outdoor mobile scenarios. An omnidirectional antenna was used at both Tx and Rx sides. In [536], 0.7 GHz, 2.3 GHz, and 3.7 GHz cross-band channel measurements were conducted in Urban Macro scenarios by two sets of time-domain channel sounders. Two of these three frequency bands were measured simultaneously at each channel measurement. At the Rx side, 4 × 4 dual-polarization planar antenna array was used for 0.7 GHz channel measurements, and 8 × 4 dual-polarization planar antenna array was used for 2.3 GHz and 3.7 GHz channel measurements. At the Tx side, a single omnidirectional antenna was used for all frequency bands channel measurements. In [537], a time domain channel sounder was used to conduct SISO and MIMO channel measurements in a large indoor office environment. For SISO channel measurements, two omnidirectional antennas were used as the transmitting and receiving antennas. For MIMO channel measurements, the 4×4 dual-polarization planar antenna array was used at the Tx side and the 4×8 dual-polarization cylindrical antenna array was used at the Rx side. In [538], a 32 × 56 MIMO channel measurement at 3.5 GHz was implemented via time-division multiplexing (TDM). The high-speed electrical switches were configured at both Tx and Rx sides. In order to investigate the path loss at mmWave, a 28 GHz channel sounder based on a vector network analyzer (VNA) was constructed in an outdoor scenario in [539]. The rotating platforms were used at both the Tx and Rx sides to obtain spatial characteristics of channels. Moreover, a VNA based (i.e., frequency domain) channel sounder was presented in [540]. Both the measurement frequency and bandwidth of this channel sounder are up to 40 GHz and 500 MHz, respectively. In [541], a 140-220 GHz THz channel sounder based on a VNA and frequency extenders was constructed to conduct a LoS measurement campaign. By analyzing the power delay profile of measurements, multipaths were not neglected in the LoS channels. In [542], a 220-330 GHz THz channel sounder with a bandwidth of 2 GHz was constructed to investigate the frequency dependence of path loss in indoor static scenarios. Both Tx and Rx of this sounder were equipped with high-gain directional horn antennas. In [543], a frequency-domain channel sounder was constructed to conduct indoor channel measurements for LiFi communications using IR LEDs with centroid wavelength at 850 nm. Both transceivers have wide filed-of-view (FoV) and beamwidth, which can well support mobile scenarios. By using a time-domain channel sounder, an outdoor V2V channel measurement at the VL band was shown in [544].

        <p>Also, based on the coverage scenarios of channel measurement, channel sounders can be mainly divided into UAV, maritime, and mine channel sounders. To study the wireless propagation channel in maritime communication scenarios, the corresponding channel sounders are needed for channel measurement. In [545], a time-domain channel sounder was used to measure the channel characteristics in a sea port scenario. The vertically polarized omnidirectional antennas were equipped at both Tx and Rx sides. A channel measurement campaign at an open sea environment was conducted by a time domain channel sounder [546]. The channel sounder worked at 2.075 GHz with a bandwidth of 200 MHz. Two vertically polarized antennas were equipped at the Tx and Rx sides. UAV channel sounders are usually miniaturized and lightweight, as they need to be mounted on the UAV. In [547], channel measurements at C-band and L-band in an air-to-ground scenario were conducted by a UAV channel sounder. The sounder measured the time-varying CIR via the collection of PDPs. In [548], a time domain UAV channel sounder was constructed to conduct channel measurement at 3.1-4.8 GHz in an air-to-ground scenario. Omnidirectional antennas were used at both the UAV and GS sides. In general, the structure of underground mines can be divided two categories, i.e., tunnel mines and room-and-pillar mines. In [549], a time domain channel sounder was used to conduct channel measurement at 3 GHz in a room-and-pillar mine. An omnidirectional biconical antenna was used at both Tx and Rx sides. In [549], a frequency-domain channel sounder was used to conduct channel measurement at 60 GHz in a tunnel mine.

        <p>Finally, based on the application scenarios, current channel sounders can be divided into those for massive MIMO, RIS, IIoT, and ISAC. Massive MIMO channel sounders are usually equipped with large-scale antenna In [551] the channel measurements were conducted at 5.3 GHz by using the ultramassive MIMO channel sounder. The Tx antenna array was equipped with 8 omnidirectional antennas. A uniform linear array (ULA) up to 4.3 m with antenna element spacing of 0.6 wavelengths was used at the Rx side. In [552], a massive MIMO time domain channel sounder was constructed to conduct channel measurements at 1.4725 GHz in an outdoor stadium.

        <p>In 6G, communication systems will not only undertake multi-band, multi-dimensional and high-performance communication needs, but also integrate new capabilities such as communication, sensing, computing and artificial intelligence [597]. To evaluate the key performances of 6G communication systems, such as throughout, spectral efficiency, and delay, the real data testbed for 6G is required. Hence, the Purple Mountain Laboratories is constructing a 6G comprehensive verification platform named as "TKµ" [598]. This testbed mainly includes cell-free ultra-massive distributed MIMO communication, RIS-assisted 6G wireless communication, space-airground integrated communication, mmWave/THz communication, and grading intelligence part. It will be able to validate Tbps-level for peak rate, kbps/Hz-level for spectral efficiency, µs-level for delay, and endogenous security and intelligence. First, cell-free ultra-massive distributed MIMO adopts physical layer sinking, fronthaul networks, and decentralization merge to achieve cell-free networks, which is capable of breaking the boundary effect in traditional cellular architectures. Further, the cell-free architecture integrated with ultra-massive MIMO antennas is constructed to guarantee the spectral efficiency of kbps/Hz-level. Second, RIS-assisted 6G wireless communications are also incorporated into the "TKµ" 6G comprehensive verification platform to enhance the coverage of EM radiation and the rank of channel matrix, eliminate signal interference, focus energy, improve positioning accuracy, and improve information and power transmission, etc. Third, due to the limited coverage and network capacity for the ground network, it can no longer meet the explosive demand for high-speed and reliable network access anytime and anywhere on the earth. Hence, the space-air-ground integrated communication had been widely researched in the academia and industry [599]. The "TKµ" 6G comprehensive verification platform will combine space-air-ground-sea integrated techniques to achieve full coverage. Fourth, compared with sub-6 GHz, the mmWave and THz frequency can provide sufficient bandwidths to increase the peak rate for communication.

        <p>A. Fundamental Theories 1) Novel Channel Research: The traditional channel research often follows four steps: channel measurement, channel parameter estimation, channel characteristic analysis, and channel modeling. This passive way of recognizing channels has a number of limitations. The channel measurement is time-consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. In addition, channel measurements in reality can never cover all frequency bands or scenarios. The large amount of data and high computation complexity also bring challenges to the channel parameter estimation. The channel characteristics can be analyzed only at known frequencies and in known scenarios, and it is unable to fully explore the complicated relationship between new characteristics and frequencies/scenarios. Finally, the traditional channel modeling is unable to predict channel characteristics of unknown frequency bands/scenarios in the future. For 6G, channel researches need to evolve from passively recognizing channels to actively recognizing and control channels, including 6G standardized pervasive channel modeling [531], AI-based predictive 6G channel modeling [604]- [607], scenario adaptive channel modeling, and RIS channel modeling [608], [609].A.

        <p>2) EM Information Theory: The EM theory and information theory are the two theoretical cornerstones of wireless communications. The EM theory is a theory on the generation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. The information theory is a theory on how information can be transmitted accurately and efficiently with limited bandwidth and power. The EM theory is based on continuous time and space, and can be used to obtain the continuous-space EM field distribution. However, using the EM theory alone cannot calculate the channel capacity. Information theory can be utilized to calculate the discrete-space channel capacity, but not the continuousspace channel capacity. The EM theory and information theory are connected by the antenna theory and wireless propagation channel modeling theory. In particular, the wireless propagation channel, originating from antennas and carries information via EM waves, serves as the bridge linking the EM theory and information theory. The relationships between these four classic theories are shown in Fig. 12.2) EM Information Theory: The EM theory and information theory are the two theoretical cornerstones of wireless communications.

        <p>Note that with the development of 6G key technologies, some problems cannot be solved by the above individual theory, which brings both challenges and opportunities for the integration of the four theories. For example, as 6G wireless communication networks expand from local terrestrial coverage to global coverage of space-air-ground-sea integrated networks, the numbers of users, base stations, relays, and/or RISs continue to increase. The positions of base stations and users in moving networks such as LEO satellite, UAV, and vehicular networks tend to change continuously. Therefore, 6G wireless communication networks show a trend of evolution from discrete space to continuous space, requiring the acquisition of CSI and calculation of channel capacity at any position in the continuous space to facilitate system design. In this case, the integration of the above four theories is inevitable. Additionally, with the increase of antenna size and antenna elements in ultra-massive MIMO, Tx/Rx antennas become more closely related to the environment. In other words, Tx/Rx antennas and the underlying wireless propagation channel become inseparable and therefore, the integration of antenna theory and wireless propagation channel modeling theory is necessary. Furthermore, as the antenna element spacing decreases in holographic MIMO, the evolution of antenna arrays from discrete to continuous apertures brings new demands on channel characterization, antenna design, and continuousspace channel capacity calculation. Again, the integration of the above four theories is required. In summary, compared with 5G, 6G wireless communication networks put forward new applications and technical requirements, which go beyond the application scopes of every individual theory. The developments of classic theories have encountered bottlenecks. Thus, it is urgent to study the integration of EM theory and information theory, i.e., EM information theory [610], [611], which will serve as a theoretical foundation for 6G wireless communication networks and help achieve new breakthroughs.Note that with the development of 6G key technologies, some problems cannot be solved by the above individual theory, which brings both challenges and opportunities for the integration of the four theories.

        <p>Iterative and Joint Baseband Processing: Iterative receivers have long been regarded to enjoy higher system capacity and link reliability than existing separate baseband processing [612]. They iteratively exchange soft information among two or more of the channel estimator, MIMO detector, NOMA detector, channel decoder, and source decoder [613]- [620]. However, the increased usage of each module caused by iterations may burden the system with high latency and computational complexity. As most modules are dedicated to solving the maximum a posterior estimation problem, they can be processed in a unified Bayesian network by exploiting their similarities, therefore improving the EE of the iterative receiver. Since the signal flow is serial, another approach is to regard multiple modules as a whole with the final output as the estimation object for joint processing, such as joint detection and decoding [621], [622].Iterative and Joint Baseband Processing: Iterative receivers have long been regarded to enjoy higher system capacity and link reliability than existing separate baseband processing [612].

First of all, communication channels are the basis for subsequent research and development of communication systems and networks. Diverse frequency bands and scenarios bring great challenges to the channel measurement and modeling, and it is necessary to consider how to integrate unique channel characteristics in satellite [626], [627], UAV [628], [629], ocean [630], [631], and ground scenarios in a pervasive channel model [74]. Furthermore, the architecture design, mobility management, network protocol, resource allocation, routing strategy, EE enhancement, and other issues in the space-air-ground-sea integrated network are also in urgent need of innovation. It is necessary to design a safe and efficient network architecture, so that diverse communication systems can be smoothly integrated to provide users with reliable and safe communication services [632]. Efficient, safe, and anonymous authentication protocols for the integrated networks are also of great importance [633].

In addition, the characteristics of high mobility and dynamic network topology in the spaceair-ground-sea integrated network need to be considered in the design of network protocols, resource allocation, and routing strategies [52], [634]- [636]. In terms of network maintenance and optimization, it is necessary to consider the power supply of the communication platform and the load of UAVs and other equipment in the space-based and air-based networks, which has high requirements for the overall EE of the network. At the same time, it is necessary to consider how to make compromise between the network performance improvement and the cost [637]. What's more, how to use AI, DL, and other intelligent technologies to optimize the network architecture and improve the overall network performance [217], [638] is also one of the current challenges.B.

The RF-optical heterogeneous hybrid networks cover a series of hybrid networks, and their applications cover various scenarios e.g., indoor, outdoor V2V, free space, and underwater [73]. There are mainly two categories of hybrid networks, RF/Optical hybrid systems, which include mmWave/VLC systems, indoor WiFi/LiFi, underwater acoustic/optical communication, and optical/optical hybrid systems, which include VLC/OCC and FSO/OCC. However, the realization of RF-optical heterogeneous systems and networks face a series of challenges. On one hand, like other heterogeneous networks (such as spaceair-ground-sea integrated networks), RF-optical heterogeneous networks face common challenges of heterogeneous networks, including mobility management (network switching), transmission network protocols design, load balancing, heterogeneous network synchronization, resource allocation and EE improvement [639], spectrum allocation [640], as well as joint access points and power allocation [641]. On the other hand, due to the large frequency gap between the RF and optical bands, there are several special challenges that RFoptical heterogeneous networks need to solve. First of all, it is necessary to consider the transceivers with different characteristics in RF and optical communication networks. For instance, when users are moving, the heterogeneity of access points brings great challenges to frequent handovers [642]. The hybrid systems need to integrate the optoelectronic characteristics and meet the different bandwidth requirements of different transmission media, which brings great difficulty to the fusion of RF/optical hardware systems and channel models [531]. Secondly, the network selection criteria of different optical wireless networks are usually different, which are also different from the existing RF communication networks. It is necessary to consider how to design the optimal network selection strategy [73]. In addition, due to the limited energy of terminal equipment, the large influence of mobility on uplink OWCs, and the interference of uplink OWCs on the lighting, there are still great limitations in the uplink OWCs [73]. Finally, the challenge of system security brought by the heterogeneous systems cannot be ignored [643].2) RF-optical Heterogeneous and Hybrid Networks: To achieve the vision of 6G full spectrum, it is a promising development of 6G that systems of different frequency bands, including RF and the whole optical wireless bands, will be integrated to realize heterogeneous and hybrid systems and networks that support all frequency bands.

The key challenge is to model the relationship between the AI performance and the network configuration as well as an online network configuration scheme that adapts to network dynamics [645]. Besides, noting that more advanced and accurate AI models typically consume a lot of energy and incur significant environmental costs, there is an urgent need to study how to improve EE and reduce energy consumption and costs before large-scale deployment of AI services [646]. Finally, although AI technologies have many advantages, issues of privacy and data security also need to be seriously considered.

Therefore, it is necessary to consider the coordinated control of the transmission of concurrent data streams according to specific scenarios and business model. Besides, issues such as ensuring network latency requirements, designing applicable network routing, and guaranteeing system security under large amounts of data are quite challenging. At present, it is also a hot issue to introduce edge computing [666], [667], ML [662], [668], and other technologies to effectively improve the intelligence level and performance of the network.</p>
        <p>7) Digital Twin Network: Digital twin is a key technology to support the realization of 6G all-digital vision. On one hand, developing from 5G, the 6G network with greatly improved performance will provide a series of novel digital twin applications, such as the digital twin body area network [52] and digital twin city [95]. On the other hand, applying the digital twin technology to the communication network can accelerate the realization of a more secure, efficient, intelligent, and visualized 6G network through real-time mapping and interaction between the physical network and the twin network. The vision of network digital twin puts forward high requirements for the network, including holographic network virtual-real interaction mapping, full life cycle management, and real-time closed-loop control [669], which also brings a series of difficulties to the realization of network digital twin. Firstly, the 6G network will contain large-scale network elements connected with complex network topologies. Therefore, it is a huge challenge to model the real physical network in real time. In particular, the wireless channel digital twin is an indispensable part of the network digital twin. A real-time and accurate scenario-adaptive channel model needs to consider how to characterize the propagation environment accurately in real time and how to predict the possible future changes of wireless channels. In addition, considering the inconsistency in the technical implementation and supported functions of equipment from different manufacturers in the network, attention should be paid to the compatibility of network equipment in the process of data acquisition, processing, and modeling [669]. Besides, the large-scale 6G network brings great challenges to the data collection, storage, management, and processing. It is also necessary to explore how to mathematically construct complex network topology relationships in large-scale networks [669], [670].7) Digital Twin Network: Digital twin is a key technology to support the realization of 6G all-digital vision.

        <p>C. System Research 1) Green Networks: Since 5G, green communication and sustainable development have caught the attention of researchers on a global scale. With the further development of 6G technologies, applications, and social perceptions, the concept of green networks is gaining more attention. The development of energy-neutral devices is expected to make communication systems more energy efficient and enable new application scenarios where terminal power consumption is limited, such as IoT, satellite communication, and UAV communication. Besides, from the environmental and economic point of view, the development of green network is also extremely necessary. Green networks require the achievement of low EM fields, which aims to reduce the threat of EM emissions and avoid any health impact. Thus, effective evaluation, testing, and control of EMF security have become one of the pressing issues for 6G scale deployment. What's more, it is important to research and develop near zero power consumption technologies, such as RF energy harvesting, backscattering, and low-power computing, which help to break the battery capacity limitation and achieve environmentally friendly networks. In addition, AI technologies use large amounts of data to train networks, consuming large amounts of computing resources and energy, against the need for sustainable development [671]. Therefore, green AI, which can obtain new results without increasing the computational cost, is getting more and more attention [672]. It is essential to design energy efficient AI models for 6G green communication, considering computational complexity, hardware design and network deployment issues need to be considered [673].C.

        <p>2) 6G Testbeds: Some application scenarios of 6G, such as THz, optical communication, ultra-wideband, ultra-high speed transmission, and ultra-massive MIMO, bring challenges to the construction of channel sounders. Power amplifiers for high frequency bands, such as THz and optical frequency bands are very difficult to manufacture. In addition, the measurement bandwidth of channel sounders is limited by the sampling rate of the Analog to digital converter (ADC) and Digital to analog converter (DAC). At the same time, how to store the data generated by the high-speed ADC to the disk array in real time is another difficult problem. In ultra-high speed transmission scenarios, a high-speed CS repetition rate is required. In ultra-massive MIMO scenarios, channel sounders are required to support a large number of channels. A lowcost solution is channel expansion using high-speed solid-state switches. However, this method will prolong the measurement time of a single CS, and how to ensure the synchronization of switching needs to be considered.2) 6G Testbeds: Some application scenarios of 6G, such as THz, optical communication, ultra-wideband, ultra-high speed transmission, and ultra-massive MIMO, bring challenges to the construction of channel sounders.

        <p>In addition, with the continuous development of 6G research, more and more simulation platforms have been set up to verify the underlying theory and practicability of various 6G key technologies, and to discover the defects and limitations of actual implementations. From the current testbeds of various 6G key technologies, it can be observed that fusion is an inevitable developing trend. ISAC combined with THz brings high communication data rate and high sensing accuracy, while the combination of mmWave and optical access network can overcome wall loss and thus brings a larger coverage area. Facing the high service quality requirements of 6G, different combinations of key technologies using different frequency bands and network architectures will become a promising, creative and challenging research direction. How to find the right combination and how to correctly build a testbed for these combined technologies will become a challenge for the future development.In addition, with the continuous development of 6G research, more and more simulation platforms have been set up to verify the underlying theory and practicability of various 6G key technologies, and to discover the defects and limitations of actual implementations.

        <p>Furthermore, 6G comprehensive testbed is a complex communication system, which is required to verify all 6G key technologies. Hence, the system needs to upgrade continuously according to the development the 6G key technologies. However, the research on key technologies applied to 6G, such as ISAC, RIS, ultra-massive MIMO antennas, OWC, AI, space-air-ground-sea integrated networks, and edge intelligent platform, is not yet clear.

Moreover, a large amount of communication data puts forward higher requirements on the processing capability of the intelligent cloud platform.

As shown in Fig. 13, relying on the in-depth survey of 6G research and developments, we highlight some of the lessons learnt, as follows:</p>
        <p>1) Scenario-based design: 6G networks will provide substantial performance improvements in terms of the existing communication services. However, they will also enrich the services beyond the realms of communications and create new hitherto unexplored benefits in terms of sensing, localization and over-the-air-computing, just to name a few. These will pave the way for the seamless integration of the industrial 'vertcal domains'. The 5G systems have already given cognizance to the widely heretogeneous requirements of sophisticated application scenarios and hence introduced the eMBB, mM2M and URLLC operational modes. In line with its extremely demanding specifications, the 6G system is expected to exhibit further proliferation of the operational modes in support of more specific scenarios and 'vertical industrial' applications. This requires extremely refined multi-component optimizations tools, which are capable of finding all so-called Pareto-optimal operating points [674]. More explicitly, instead of simply setting for example the maximum affordable transmit power and the maximum outage probability as a contraint and optimizing the sum-rate of a network as a single-component objective function, all three would have to be jointly optimized. This sophisticated stochastic optimization problem would then find all optimal operating points. As a result, none of the above-mentioned metrics can be improved without degrading at least one of the others. As a compelling benefit, the system controller would the way for some breakthroughs in 6G. For example, wireless channel measurements and channel modeling for a wide range frequency bands and and scenarios will lay the foundations for the standardization of the 6G channel models, overall technical specifications and architectures. Recent advances in EM information theory will also provide new foundations for the application of 6G technologies. 4) Mutual benefit of AI+6G: AI technologies will be deeply integrated into all open system interconnection (OSI) layers of 6G networks and they will influence each other in a symbiotic manner. For example, on one hand, AI technologies can help improve the level of intelligence in 6G networks. On the other hand, the network will attain enhanced performance as a benefit of intelligent AI assistance, especially in the face of uncertainty, when its learning capability will come to rescue. services. However, further research is required for their coordinated development. 5) Pay attention to green technologies and efficiency indicators: It is essential to aim for green and environmentally friendly designs all the way from research to pre-development and network roll-out. There is a general consensus that protecting the environment and cost control have never been more important, given the escalation of tele-traffic. On one hand, we should dedicate careful research attention to the conception of energy-neutral devices and green networks relying on sophisticated joint information and energy networking [675]. On the other hand, efficiency indicators should be considered as an essential issue for the research and design of 6G systems. 6) Call for international cooperation: In the interest of seamless global roaming, we have to aim for global standards and a globally unified 6G ecology.
