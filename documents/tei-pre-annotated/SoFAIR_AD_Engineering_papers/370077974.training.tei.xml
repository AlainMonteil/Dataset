        <p>The complex structure of turning aggravates obtaining the desired results in terms of tool wear and surface roughness. The existence of high temperature and pressure make difficult to reach and observe the cutting area. In-direct tool condition, monitoring systems provide tracking the condition of cutting tool via several released or converted energy types, namely, heat, acoustic emission, vibration, cutting forces and motor current. Tool wear inevitably progresses during metal cutting and has a relationship with these energy types. Indirect tool condition monitoring systems use sensors situated around the cutting area to state the wear condition of the cutting tool without intervention to cutting zone. In this study, sensors mostly used in indirect tool condition monitoring systems and their correlations between tool wear are reviewed to summarize the literature survey in this field for the last two decades. The reviews about tool condition monitoring systems in turning are very limited, and relationship between measured variables such as tool wear and vibration require a detailed analysis. In this work, the main aim is to discuss the effect of sensorial data on tool wear by considering previous published papers. As a computer aided electronic and mechanical support system, tool condition monitoring paves the way for machining industry and the future and development of Industry 4.0.The complex structure of turning aggravates obtaining the desired results in terms of tool wear and surface roughness.

        <p>As soon as the machining process starts, the contact between tool and workpiece leads to various events for chip removing and generating a fresh surface [1,2]. The relative movement between tool and workpiece causes deterioration and is commonly known as tool wear (TW) [3]. Several types of TW become active during cutting operation; however, flank wear (FW) is accepted as the main tool life criteria and will be the research subject of this paper [4].As soon as the machining process starts, the contact between tool and workpiece leads to various events for chip removing and generating a fresh surface [1,2].

        <p>Prediction of tool life is a serious issue because of the non-linear and dynamic structure of cutting operations [5]. The complex relationship between parameters is revealed to consider each operation in itself as a result of dynamic interaction which occurs instantly. Sensors act as information sources situated around the cutting area and transmit the obtained data as rapid as possible [6]. Since sensor signals show different behavior according to machining conditions and TW, then it becomes hard to state the tool condition. For this reason, multiple sensor systems are preferred for confirmation of the different sensor signals.Prediction of tool life is a serious issue because of the non-linear and dynamic structure of cutting operations [5].

        <p>Tool condition monitoring system (TCMS) provides online monitoring of cutting operation bringing several advantages such as prediction of tool life, preventing catastrophic failures and increasing the productivity and component quality [7]. Cutting tool has a specialized form produced with a certain material to work under harsh conditions [8]. Basically, monitoring of cutting tool condition avoids unexpected changes, reduces downtime, obtains desired workpiece dimensions and eventually reduces production costs and labor [9]. In this manner, FW becomes significant as the first tool life criteria and optimization of FW is highly necessary depending on optimal cutting conditions [3].Tool condition monitoring system (TCMS) provides online monitoring of cutting operation bringing several advantages such as prediction of tool life, preventing catastrophic failures and increasing the productivity and component quality [7].

        <p>With the increasing prospects from manufacturers such as precise and punctual delivery which is basically associated with determining the optimum machining environment, several TCM approaches supported by different methods such as deep learning have been proposed [10]. In order to overcome the challenges in the future, a new perspective is required to integrate the TCMS into Industry 4.0 which is defined as the transformation from machine based manufacturing into digital manufacturing [11,12]. The idea covers non-human manufacturing environment making enabling it with internet of things and communication of machines [13]. It is in common with the TCMS and Industry 4.0 target. As known, for better evaluation and monitoring of tool condition, numerous factors should be considered in each operation. Therefore, requirements exists such a which system can correlate the turning variables and tool wear, capable of sensing the changes bad or good and their effects on tool wear more or less. That is why indirect TCMS and decision-making methods in turning are discussed trying to demonstrate the trends.With the increasing prospects from manufacturers such as precise and punctual delivery which is basically associated with determining the optimum machining environment, several TCM approaches supported by different methods such as deep learning have been proposed [10].

        <p>The main aim of this study is to summarize the indirect TCMS in detail. The subdivisions of these systems, past studies about TCMS in turning and the relationship of different sensor signals with FW will be investigated. These systems play a fundamental role for Industry 4.0 and heads for cost optimized manufacturing. An increasing trend named hybrid approaches motivates researchers to combine different methods for robust design and accurate evaluation of results [14][15][16]. TCMS allows for the research complex relations between turning parameters and process variables if it is accommodated to these systems traditional methods, i.e., analysis of variance, Taguchi, artificial neural network and fuzzy logic or a newly developed method, i.e., the bees' algorithm [17]. This approach enables to correlate sensorial data with TW and to understand the progression of wear without stopping the operation.The main aim of this study is to summarize the indirect TCMS in detail.

        <p>During more than 40 years of the studies about TCMS, the main focus has remained the same in terms of researchers and manufacturers: to recognize the tool state with several detection systems based on sensors and signal features. Since a single sensor had no capability to detect all or majority of the changes in an operation, multiple sensors needed to be applied in the past. The other side of this issue covers the software part for better understanding of the machining. In the first efforts in this field, Dornfeld and Pan [18] integrate AE for chip formation and Balakrishnan et al. [19] utilized both cutting force and AE together. After these studies, neural networks and pattern recognition based approaches were tried for decision making for real time monitoring in several papers [20][21][22]. From this point, commercial types of TCMS endeavored to integrate covering plenty of industrial companies [23]. Advanced TCMS have been extended with expedition of communication systems and the increase of internet from 2000 due to the possibility of purchasing sensor systems worldwide from the researchers in this field [24]. To date, comprehensive sensor technologies, signal processing and decision-making strategies have been applied, which will be further explained. Therefore, there was a striving in the long past of the TCMS to improve the machining operations integrating intelligent systems and to reach unmanned manufacturing with minimized error and high reliability.During more than 40 years of the studies about TCMS, the main focus has remained the same in terms of researchers and manufacturers: to recognize the tool state with several detection systems based on sensors and signal features.

        <p>Cost optimization and productivity became the main purpose in industry [25,26]. Breakdowns depend on tool breakage cause cutting tool-related downtime and expense which possess a significant place in overall cost [27]. In unmanned manufacturing, online monitoring of TW is necessary for productive usage of tool in lifetime and to prevent tool breakage. FW develops on the main cutting edge of a cutting tool as a result of the friction between cutting tool and workpiece [8]. Additional to determining desired tool life, FW affects directly SR and dimensional accuracy of workpiece. In the absence of TCMS, power consumption and manufacturing cost increase, dimensional accuracy, authority on process and sustainability decrease [28].Cost optimization and productivity became the main purpose in industry [25,26].

        <p>TCMS are examined in two different categories according to the approach of evaluation of TW in machine tools [29]. Direct methods require measuring the TW on cutting tool as area, length or width via an imaging technology. Main disadvantage of this method is to cause machine downtime and prolong manufacturing times [30]. Indirect methods on the other hand enable online monitoring of TW without intervention to process using sensor systems. Indirect methods are based on the measurement approach establishing a correlation between TW and sensor signals (CF, acoustic emission (AE), vibration, temperature, motor current/power, sound, SR). Some studies have been performed in the past which reviewed the TCMS from different viewpoints. The success of sensorial data in detecting TW is an aim in this study, primarily. In this context, TW types except for FW were not considered deliberately, and mostly preferred sensors and signal processing methods in TCMS in turning were investigated to outline the literature.TCMS are examined in two different categories according to the approach of evaluation of TW in machine tools [29].

        <p>Monitoring of tool condition is a constraining and unstable process in machining operations [31]. TW is both inevitable and necessary for chip removing and manufacturing new product. With generating new surface, TW proceeds with time, and sudden changes occur which affect the wear progression more or less. Depending on chip formation, vibration occurrence, or inhomogeneity of material structure, some unintended contacts between tool and workpiece take place [32]. These unpredictable challenges make difficult to determine tool life precisely. The need for TCMS arises from the natural development of TW and mentioned difficulties. It was stated from [33] that it can be possible to arrange the tool position for determined contact conditions between tool and workpiece with prediction of TW. At this point, indirect TCMS presents a non-destructive, easy and sustainable approach without interference to machining system [34]. The main focus is to demonstrate and investigate the papers which have motive to associate the sensor signals with FW via indirect TCMS. As it is demonstrated in Figure 1, to evaluate TW with various measurement Sensors 2021, 21, 108 4 of 32 devices, it is preferred roughness probe to measure SR, dynamometer to measure cutting forces, current sensor to measure motor current, accelerometer to measure vibration, pyrometer to measure temperature, AE sensor to measure AE, microphone to measure sound. Moreover, Figures 2 and3 show examples of TCMS developed before to monitor FW in turning. In the aspect of indirect TCMS, two types of measurement become prominent to further evaluation of gathered data. The first one is online monitoring of various data performed with sensors such as vibration, AE, CF, temperature, sound and current. The data collection from these sensors continues throughout operation without stoppage. The other type of measurement is off-line monitoring namely SR and TW which needs to be stopped of machining. In Tables 1 and2, publications used different methods in indirect tool condition monitoring system, and publications that used decision making methods in indirect tool condition monitoring system are listed respectively.Monitoring of tool condition is a constraining and unstable process in machining operations [31].

        <p>At the beginning of the machining, the cutting tool is sharp [99]. With the effect of high pressure and temperature, material loss occurs, and the contact conditions between tool and workpiece change in the progressive passes of machining [100]. The sharpness of the cutting tool reduces and the cutting process becomes difficult continuously [101]. Inevitably, there is need for higher CF to remove chip from material surface under same cutting conditions [102]. This situation refers to a relationship between TW and CF in theory. Besides, with the increased area between tool and workpiece as a result of TW, the same pressure generates more CF. Researchers intended to use the direct proportion between these two-process variable, CF measurements performed via several methods in the past. An example for cutting force based TCMS is given in Figure 4.At the beginning of the machining, the cutting tool is sharp [99].

        <p>It is suitable to measure the three components of cutting forces during turning operation since each of them can be related to different kinds of TW. Different types and mechanisms of TW can progress on flank face or rake face depend on the load factors [4]. In addition, the cutting forces were generally measured in three dimensions, namely, tangential, axial and radial axes. For a clear definition between TW and CF components, it is necessary to investigate for each type of TW separately.It is suitable to measure the three components of cutting forces during turning operation since each of them can be related to different kinds of TW.

        <p>Kuntoğlu and Sağlam [5] performed an experimental study to investigate the sensor features and to find the relationship between CF components and FW in turning of AISI 5140. It was stated that tangential and axial cutting forces were highly reliable on monitoring of FW. Aslan [36] executed optimization and analysis of CF components during turning of AISI 5140 steel. The prediction accuracy and total percent contribution of cutting parameters were found lower for radial CF than tangential and axial cutting forces. Davim and Baptista [38] intended to find relationship between TW and cutting forces in machining silicon carbide reinforced aluminum. According to them, FW was the predominant TW, and three components of cutting forces demonstrated an increasing trend with FW.

According to them, FW was the predominant TW, and three components of cutting forces demonstrated an increasing trend with FW. Moreover, axial and radial cutting forces were found more sensitive to FW. Suarez et al. [45] committed an investigation on turning of a nickel based alloy Haynes 282 to relate cutting force and TW. They reported that there was no visible relation between cutting forces and TW. Remedna and Rigal [42] investigated the evolution of tangential CF and TW during time in hard turning of an alloyed steel. It was observed that because of the mechanical contact between cutting tool-workpiece and machine tool cutting tool causes increasing in CF and changes its direction. Oraby and Hayhurst [41] demonstrated that tool force ratios provide more sensitive information using non-linear regression model for prediction of TW and tool life. They reported that force ratios are more accurate than absolute values of forces in predicting TW and tool life. El Hakim et al. [39] showed that in hard turning of high alloy steel with secondary hardening operation, CF and FW represented increasing trend simultaneously. Kunto glu and Sa glam [4] observed that tangential CF signal and FW increases with pass number in dry turning of AISI 1050 steel. Scheffer et al. [43] developed a system based on monitoring of FW in hard turning using three component dynamometer. All CF components demonstrated increasing behavior with increasing TW. Özel and Nadgir [35] developed a model based on CFs during hard turning of H-13 steel. According to results, it was possible to predict the FW for various cutting conditions. Sikdar and Chen [44] tried to correlate FW and component forces in turning of AISI 4340 steel. It was reported that tangential CF had the largest value pursued by axial and radial forces, respectively. It was seen that with increasing FW area, all components of CFs begin to increase. Kene and Choudhury [40] carried out an experimental investigation based on hard turning of EN24 steel for sensor fusion using CF alongside SR and vibration.

        <p>Acoustic means the science of sound including the vibration and noise which researches the propagation of their waves in solid, liquid or gas mediums. However, AE states the radiation of strain waves in a material subjected to an external load. This exposure leads to deformation of material in different levels such as degradation, breakage or wear. In other words, AE can be defined as the energy release that takes place in the material in micro scale which is deserted from other types of energies for example vibration, force and sound [6]. In machining and especially during turning, continuous contact among the cutting tool and workpiece produces a variety of shaped chips which causes different types of wear on the cutting tool as a result of plastic deformation [4]. The interaction between cutting tool, workpiece and chip appears as the main source of AE which end up with the friction, TW and tool breakage, deformation at contact zones, chip collision, chip breakage and chip tangling [104]. Among these effects, tool and chip breakage and some of the TW types, namely, chipping or built up edge, generate high amplitude AE signals, more commonly known as AE burst signals [84]. On the other hand, continuous type AE signals which possess low amplitude are generated with chip removing, TW and chip tangling. The characterization of AE signals provides information about machining mechanism and ensuing events in the cutting area throughout metal removing. Several AE signal features were applied in the past to distinguish worn and undamaged cutting tool [105]. That is why AE applications became the most popular technological approach in monitoring turning operations among the sensor systems in the last two decades compared to earlier.

        <p>In order to obtain the desired results from the machining process, to keep the process variables under control and to avoid undesirable results, the necessary conditions must be provided to continue the process in a stable manner [31]. In this regard, vibrations occur because of the lack of rigidity in the machine, errors in the workpiece and cutting tool connecting procedure or depending on the altering cutting conditions during the machining process [36]. Vibration is an undesirable condition that adversely affects the machining process. In addition, a vibration occurs in the system continuously as the CF occurring during machining depends on many factors such as distance between cutting edges, position angle, workpiece geometry, spindle deflection, depth of cut, chip width, feed rate, cutting speed and especially the TW [5]. Considering the literature survey, it has been observed that many diverse techniques are used to monitor TW. These methods are expressed under two main headings, directly and indirectly. The first technique is to measure TW directly on the tool by finishing the material removal process. In the second technique, different parameters associated with TW such as motor current, force and moment, vibration, acoustic and SR values are measured with appropriate test instruments. These measurements are evaluated using various analysis and estimation methods, and the amount of wear in different time intervals can be calculated [109]. Estimation methods are based on modern and topical approaches such as fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, as well as statistical methods [6]. Although several studies on process modeling with the help of artificial intelligence have been conducted by various researchers, a practical method has not yet been developed to monitor TW in the industry. A variety of researches are still carrying on monitoring tool condition, controlling machining processes and ensuring their optimization and prediction. In Figure 6, vibration based TCMS is shown in addition to current and surface roughness measurement.In order to obtain the desired results from the machining process, to keep the process variables under control and to avoid undesirable results, the necessary conditions must be provided to continue the process in a stable manner [31].

        <p>In machining, vibration is considered one of the variables that best reflect the TCM process. Factors such as ease of application and no need to make any arrangements to the machine tool or workpiece fixture are among the most important advantages that distinguish vibration measurement from the aforementioned parameters. Therefore, vibration monitoring procedures are widely used to diagnose and predict part accuracy, surface texture, and especially tool condition. Vibrations occurring during machining are classified into two classes as vibrations dependent on the cutting process and vibrations independent of the cutting process [110]. The type of vibration that occurs as a result of TW during machining is called vibrations that are dependent on the cutting process. Therefore, monitoring TW requires recording and monitoring vibrations that depend on the cutting process [4]. TW increases during cutting and these increases lead to an increment in vibration amplitude [5].In machining, vibration is considered one of the variables that best reflect the TCM process. Factors such as ease of application and no need to make any arrangements to the machine tool or workpiece fixture are among the most important advantages that distinguish vibration measurement from the aforementioned parameters. Therefore, vibration monitoring procedures are widely used to diagnose and predict part accuracy, surface texture, and especially tool condition. Vibrations occurring during machining are classified into two classes as vibrations dependent on the cutting process and vibrations independent of the cutting process [110]. The type of vibration that occurs as a result of TW during machining is called vibrations that are dependent on the cutting process. Therefore, monitoring TW requires recording and monitoring vibrations that depend on the cutting process [4]. TW increases during cutting and these increases lead to an increment in vibration amplitude [5].</p>

They measured the tool acceleration signals generated during cutting and then determined wearsensitive properties according to the dynamics of the tool/holder system, which manifested itself at natural frequencies. They determined the recorded signals using the autoregressive moving average model. According to the analysis of the experimental results, they found that in the speedup phase of wear, a vibration mode changed from the second bending mode in the main cutting direction to the first bending mode in the feed direction and simultaneously the autoregressive moving average distance reached a minimum value.

        <p>Advantages and disadvantages: One of the distinctive advantages of this sensor is to provide information about one of the main problems in machining. Vibration ruptures the nature of machining by changing the pre-determined cutting tool-workpiece contact conditions which further damages the tool structure and have devastating influence on workpiece. Thus, integration of an accelerometer helps to standardize the machining condition as stable during continuous vibration and unstable when excessive vibration occurs. Industrially applicable accelerometers can be easily mounted on various points of the machine tool for measuring the stiffness, in addition. Especially for finish turning operations and internal turning, vibration becomes a very challenging issue. With the increasing demand from customers, high accuracy products will be the most important thing for a company in terms of the reputation in market. The given applications based on accelerometer and vibration measurement are about 19.6% among all indirect monitoring systems including the studies in the perspective of this paper.

Das and Chapagain [61] presented a study that investigated cutting parameters on temperature in turning of aluminum matrix composites. While the feed rates were 0.05, 0.1, 0.16 and 0.2, temperatures increasing from 36.60 to 71.67 °C depend on the feed rate increase. When it came to cutting speed (40,106,169,206), the temperature increased from 36.60 to 83.50 °C. While depth of cut was also an effective parameter on the temperature increase, it was determined that the most effective parameter was cutting speed. Effects of the cutting speed on the temperature in in dry hard turning of Inconel 718 were studied by Zhao and Liu [68]. It was reported that temperature shows an increasing trend with the increase of cutting speed. The temperature values can decline up to 30 °C by means of coating of cutting tools. Ö zbek and Saruhan [63] presented a study related to effects of cutting zone temperature on TW. It was reported that both cutting tool coating and cutting speed have a great impact on cutting zone temperature, and this temperature can be reduced by minimum quantity lubrication system, approximately 100 °C. One of the possible explanations of low temperature owing to minimum quantity lubrication system was that minimum quantity lubrication system moved away the chips from the surface with high pressure. Moreover, it was indicated that this phenomenon can be observed via thermal images. There were some studies in comparison with the studies which reported the cutting speed was the most effective parameters on temperature increase. Kuntoğlu et al. [31] reported a study that depth of cut is the most effective parameter on the increase of cutting zone temperature. The reason was that high depth of cut values leads to large amount of metal chip removal, and the cutting tool undergoes a more restrictive force. Due to the chip removal and the restrictive forces, the workpiece was under the shear effect. In another study which supported these evaluations belonging to [48], the effect of depth of cut on temperature and TW was investigated, and they reported that depth of cut was the dominant cutting parameter rather than cutting speed and feed rate. There were other studies [62,67] which indicated the most important parameters were depth of cut on the temperature increase and TW progression. In [31,39,48,[61][62][63][64][65][66][67][68], it was reported that a correlation between cutting temperature and TW was found, mostly triggered by cutting conditions and cutting speed. Temperature based measurement provided significant contribution for detecting TW progress and El Hakim et al. [39] indicated that in hard turning of high alloy steel with secondary hardening operation, temperature and flank TW demonstrated an increasing trend. Increasing cutting speed triggers the cutting temperature, and it leads to increase in TW. Increasing cutting speed and feed rate parameters were two of the most effective parameters which control the increase in temperature. Yıldırım et al. [66] reported that increasing feed rate (0.1, 0.125, 0.15 mm/rev) reduced to tool life by 32.73%, 29.89% and 38.01%. This tool life decrease is a result of high temperature between tool and workpiece. When the dry machining and nano-minimum quantity lubrication system were compared, it could be seen that the tool life could be increased by 105%. If the nano minimum quantity lubrication system was applied at the ratio of 1 vol%, the temperature could be decreased by approximately 30%. Another study was reported that high temperature levels increased the adhesive and diffusive TW, and they should be controlled by a lubrication strategy based on the machining process [65]. Sasahara et al. [64] presented a study including the effect of the temperature on the tool life. The workpiece material was SUS304 stainless steel, and two different machining conditions, which were dry and minimum quantity lubrication, were investigated. When the cutting speeds were selected as 100, 300, 500 m/min, the temperatures were measured as 550, 850, 1000 • C respectively in the dry machining condition. However, the temperature values decreased after the minimum quantity lubrication process at the ratio of 10%, 5%, 8% reduction of temperature depending on the lubrication system extending the tool life.

        <p>Advantages and disadvantages: Temperature measurement can be achieved with inexpensive sensors; it is one of the principal advantages. Since the most part of the heat dissipated to removed chips during machining, and the main aim is to measure the temperature on cutting tool, collecting signals from cutting area becomes almost impossible while machining continues. It is possible to measure the temperature of chips and then learn the approximate value of cutting tool and workpiece using transition equations. This may lead to an error to obtain the exact value which becomes a disadvantage when working high range of temperatures. On the previous study published by author [5], it was stated that tool temperature sensor signals are quite effective on detecting tool FW (74%). On the other hand, the papers examined in the scope of this study tend to use temperature measurement for monitoring of FW, which is close to usually preferred cutting force measurement proportionately (18%).Advantages and disadvantages: Temperature measurement can be achieved with inexpensive sensors; it is one of the principal advantages.

        <p>In situ control of turning process is a difficult task due to the stochastic nature of TW. This leads to great challenge in terms of achieving optimum conditions [41]. Timedependent wear of cutting tool changes the predetermined cutting conditions and affects process variables considerably [113]. Motor power and motor current are the main sources for metal cutting and are associated with the changes at the cutting area especially for the TW. In theory, it is expected that with the increase of cutting TW, CFs demonstrate enhancing behavior, and this directly affects the cutting power and current [29]. However, the utilization of current sensor in TCMS is very little compared to the aforementioned sensors, i.e., force, AE, vibration and temperature. In the author's previous study, current sensor was found as the third effective signal on FW among the seven sensor signals [5]. Nevertheless, it was observed that the sensor signal was ineffective to sense the approaching tool breakage.

        <p>It is basically generated sound that exists in all machining operations as a result of high speeds for cutting of hard materials. In milling, intermittent cutting produces also discontinuous sound due to consecutive entry and exit of cutting tool into workpiece material. However, in turning, continuous contact between tool and workpiece produces different shaped chips, depending on cutting conditions and material properties. Besides, a new cutting tool is effective on metal removing compared to a worn cutting tool. This makes difficult to cut, and scraping starts instead of cutting as a result of the changing cutting tool geometry. An impaired cutting mechanism affects the resultant sound, and this can be an information source for the condition of TW [24]. Sound measurement is fundamentally done with microphone; however, sound signals have some drawbacks. The separation of frequency range of sounds originated from chip formation, TW and breakage, machine tool, and vibration should be performed accurately to detect the desired quality characteristic. For this reason, this sensor is preferred over the two other sensors.It is basically generated sound that exists in all machining operations as a result of high speeds for cutting of hard materials.

        <p>Sound sensor was preferred in [73] for reliable and faster decision making in addition to acceptable cost-performance ratio. Favorable estimation error for TW was obtained according to results. Lu and Kannatey-Asibu [71] performed sound sensor based experimental work to monitor FW, and they reported that it can be useful and execute the ability of operator. Mannan et al. [72] applied sound sensor for analysis of TW during turning of AISI 4340 steel. According to authors, the proposed method can successfully distinguish sharp tool from dull tool. On another study from Abu-Zahra ve Gang [69], it was demonstrated that because of the acoustic behavior of ultrasonic waves, TW can be monitored successfully by this method. Kopac ve Sali [70] carried out experimental research to predict TW using online TCMS during turning of Ck15 and obtained results showed that increasing TW was correlated with the increase in amplitude of sound. Considering References [69][70][71][72][73], it can be concluded that sound signals seem very effective on detection of FW according to the authors' reports. Low cost and easy to implement structure of this sensor enable to use it in TCMS in turning operations for different types of materials. A current based TCMS is hard to find in open literature for turning, especially its correlation with TW [24]. Some attempts about current measurement during milling and drilling were undertaken, yet none of them related to TW [114][115][116]. Szecsi [74] used DC motor based TCMS to evaluate TW, and according to the author, armature current of the main motor can be informative to determine the condition of tool during CNC turning. Kunto glu and Sa glam [5] established a TCMS for FW and tool breakage monitoring, and current sensor was found to be successful after AE and temperature sensors on monitoring of FW in turning of AISI 5140. Kunto glu et al. [6] optimized the cutting conditions using sensor couples for FW among the five different sensors. Current sensor was successful but, however, not the best option. Salgado and Alonso [73] presented an approach based on using current signals for online TW monitoring during turning of AISI 1040. They estimated axial CF using current signals for further evaluation of FW within high success rate. Yip and To [75] integrated eddy current damping to reduce vibration for turning of titanium alloy with the purpose of enhancement of tool life.Sound sensor was preferred in [73] for reliable and faster decision making in addition to acceptable cost-performance ratio.

        <p>Advantages and disadvantages: Principal requirement for a sensor is being close to the cutting area because of the increased sensitivity. The main disadvantage of the current measurement is its connection to cutting area is that it is performed with current transfer cable, which transmits energy to machine tool. Different from the other sensors in indirect TCMS, current sensor is situated at a distance, and this leads to loss of precision. Due to the mentioned drawbacks of this sensor, it has been preferred rarely (8.1%) in the past for progressive FW detection in turning. In addition, current measurement is important as one of the first sensors used in TCMS in the 1980s.

        <p>Advantages and disadvantages: A microphone resembles an operator ear somehow, which was utilized from the beginning of the machining for health monitoring. Considering sustained success sound-based monitoring provides quite important benefits. However, compared with AE sensor, reaction time is very long, which makes the microphone less reliable.

        <p>Advantages and disadvantages: Since the tool wear inevitably develops on the cutting insert, it should be kept under control to understand the underlying mechanism for avoiding excessive levels. In this direction, one of the main advantages of it is that online monitoring of tool wear is feasible with indirect sensors without stopping the operation. Due to FW increases on the main cutting edge and proper for quantifying with standards, its detection offers vital information about the remaining useful life of the cutting tool. However, the sophistication because of the numerous cutting parameters and variables aggravates accurate estimation of tool wear on occasion. In order to validate the wear progression rate, this is necessary, which leads to high investment cost for reliable and sustainable manufacturing.Advantages and disadvantages: Since the tool wear inevitably develops on the cutting insert, it should be kept under control to understand the underlying mechanism for avoiding excessive levels.

The purpose of machining is not only to shape the part but also to realize the correct process in terms of surface quality [142,143]. SR is a very important process variable in turning as being an ultimate aim. Cutting tool radius, feed and cutting speed can be shown among the factors that significantly affect the SR in turning. Aside from the material of the workpiece, vibration on the machine tool also affects the SR, and these factors were statistically significant on the SR [140].Considering the technological developments in recent years, it can be seen that excellence was aimed in terms of product quality. In Figure 6, a surface-roughness-based TCMS is shown.

        <p>Image processing is a pattern recognition process that works with a strategy based on measurement of image textures in a variety of application areas such as statistical data analysis, machine learning and signal processing [78]. These systems simply need a camera to divide the image into segments for an intense analysis since there are repetitive patterns on an image [157]. The primary challenge for pattern recognition method is to segment a whole image and determine boundaries. After that, it is required to describe the characteristics of each region for further analysis and decision making. In the measurement of TW and FW in the concept of this paper, the worn region on a cutting tool needs to be distinguished from the unworn region. Once textures are identified as worn or unworn in a moment during the machining, the state of the wear level of cutting tool according to cutting time is described.

        <p>Advantages and disadvantages: Different from the mentioned sensor systems, image processing is applied after machining operation is completed. This situation brings a disadvantage since the prevention of tool breakage and excessive tool wear becomes difficult and almost impossible. However, when the machining stopped for different reasons, such as measuring of surface roughness, it is possible to employ pattern-recognition-based applications. This approach provides additional information about tool and can be beneficial for confirmation of the collected sensor data. It is noteworthy that well-structured software can predict the situation of the tool within high success rates, which improves the quality of machining by far. According to published papers in the field of monitoring of turning operation for FW, it was found that 9.8% of the studies preferred image processing techniques for that purpose. This can be explained by the incapability of these systems to intervene in the machining processes.Advantages and disadvantages: Different from the mentioned sensor systems, image processing is applied after machining operation is completed.

Ojha and Dixit [85] presented a neural network approach for continuous monitoring of tool life in the shop floor during turning of steel. Since a large number of data are available, tool life can be estimated using this example. In articles [34,81,83] neural-network-based TW prediction was also carried out for H-13 steel, AISI 1045 and SAE 6150 steel successfully.Fuzzy logic uses membership functions to link the input and output parameters via predetermined rule list. It is actually a reasoning-based methodology provides to estimate the desired parameter from 0 to 1 possibility. Human observation and the way of thinking is the example for development of the fuzzy logic approach. Fuzzification, rule editor and defuzzification processes are respectively applied to input data values. At first, the range of membership functions are defined with the training of input values; then, using rules, inputs and outputs are linked to each other, and lastly, fuzzy terms are converted to numerical values again with defuzzification. There are two basic fuzzy types, as Mamdani and Sugeno, in the modeling interface of fuzzy logic. In the prediction phase, methods should be identified, namely, and, or, implication, aggregation and defuzzification. The membership functions of inputs and outputs, type of fuzzy and decision methods are demonstrated in Figure 13. In [5], in addition to cutting parameters, AE and tool tip tem- In the particular example of this paper, FW prediction via artificial neural network in turning operations using different types of materials has been an attractive issue in the past. In references [35,[82][83][84][85][86], artificial-neural-network-based TW prediction was successfully carried out and highly recommended. D'Addona et al. [83] performed a cognitive modeling of TW for Inconel 718 to obtain better tool life. They used neural network model for estimation of TW progression and results obtained with low prediction errors.

        <p>Hidden Markov model is based on an observation strategy for the modeled system, which proposes to learn it via Markov process. Being another process, behavior is assumed as dependent and should be handled separately. Markov process is evaluated as a hidden or unobservable condition using the actual data in the system, which further ensures the validity of the result [162]. The usage of dependent factors for the recognition of observable events becomes useful for the ones improper to directly observe. Hidden Markov model enables to implement several software programs for modeling, which can be evaluated in a variety of processes, especially in machining. The structure of hidden Markov model is shown in Figure 14. Scheffer et al. [60] implemented neural networks and hidden Markov models as a comparative study in monitoring of TW. In turning of aluminum alloy, a comprehensive comparison was performed, and neural network was found as capable of performing continuous estimations; however, if the problem to solve is defined well, hidden Markov properly estimates TW. There were a handful of studies about hidden Markov model in machining operations, and a few of them are about TW prediction during turning.Hidden Markov model is based on an observation strategy for the modeled system, which proposes to learn it via Markov process.

        <p>Turning is a widespread machining operation that can efficiently remove chips from a rotating and cylindrical workpiece. Cutting tools are the main components of an entire production chain dealing with the workpiece which is considered as the ultimate aim of manufacturing. Turning tools are employed to change with new ones before reaching wear limit for healthier and low-cost operation. Tool breakage is a devastating event causing diverse damages such as machine downtime, workpiece deterioration and increased total costs. Unexpected tool breakage and usage of a cutting tool in lifetime requires TCMS that can diagnose the tool condition with sensor systems or pattern recognition approaches. Indirect TCMS are more suitable for industrial applications because of their applicability and sustainability and for being economical. Besides, the papers which have motivation to correlate the sensor signals with tool FW using indirect TCMS are included in this review. A general outline was performed on indirect TCMS for turning operations in this study for the last two decades. Advanced monitoring systems and their integration to manufacturing systems serve as a supportive component for production of complex parts. These systems enable detection of errors in cutting tools and workpieces for higher accuracy. Moreover, it is possible to set communications between sensors and machine tools to make decision for the health of the machining. Software based solutions can be obtained in this manner, which is a better approach for the management and supply chain in a production platform. In the future, it would be also possible to integrate different combination of advanced cutting tools and new generation materials. The experience on machining to date is a guide for this purpose, but there is a requirement for advanced artificial intelligence systems and their successful integration to manufacturing processes. The selection of appropriate signal processing and evaluation methods after choice and accomplished integration of sensor systems is noteworthy. There is need for complete and multi-disciplinary information on robust and high accuracy monitoring systems. TCMS based systems became reliable auxiliary especially in turning operations enhancing the quality of the workpiece, tool life and productivity. Besides, further applications on monitoring of cutting tool can be improved to adaptive control systems for online decision making.

        <p>The prominent sensors have been considered as dynamometer, AE, temperature and accelerometer with their success in detection and preferability in the field of TCMS in turning. Almost all of these sensors are expensive and increase initial investment costs. However, advances and complications in machining technologies make these sensors essential, applicable, tenable and sustainable for online monitoring. Clearly, their quick response time and easy to implement structure is attractive to solve the sophistication while turning. For improved diagnosis and prognostics, the accurate implementation of decision-making methods for different types of sensors is notable. This situation generates a problem that there is need researchers represent different disciplines for more profound analysis during preprocess and post process. An important issue is fast convergence of the parameters for optimal values which can be possible using emerging data analysis methods. The integration of different types of data for an ultimate decision about the operation should be performed. Another challenging issue is collecting data together and analysis them which require comprehensive information that entail the utilization of data communication for health monitoring. In order to practice the prognostic health management with intelligent systems, the emerging technologies in the field namely edge computing, machine learning integrated embedded devices should be used. These systems monitor the operation with advanced software components for sustainability of the production while managing cost and safety. High technology supported manufacturing systems ensures the diagnosis of major errors affecting the dimensions of the workpiece and reducing remaining useful lifetime of the cutting tool. Generally, condition-based maintenance systems preserve the available situation which is predetermined by operator accepted that as the optimal condition. Eventually, for the purpose of the Industry 4.0, a holistic approach is required to avoid a variety of defects and breakdowns during the turning operation.The prominent sensors have been considered as dynamometer, AE, temperature and accelerometer with their success in detection and preferability in the field of TCMS in turning.

        <p>Artificial neural networks and ANFIS applications have been utilized satisfactorily in turning operations for FW as it can be clearly seen. These methods were first among the others which demonstrated the success of neural-networks-based prediction and monitoring. With this survey, it is intended to show the primary applications on sensors and decision-making technologies, their advantages and drawbacks. It is suggested that a specific TCMS equipped with correct sensors, signal processing method and classification is the most developed one for a specific work material. That drives the researchers to investigate each sensor feature and signal processing method in detail.Artificial neural networks and ANFIS applications have been utilized satisfactorily in turning operations for FW as it can be clearly seen.

        <p>Despite there being important initiatives to evaluate TW, CFs, vibration, AE and SR, analysis, modeling and optimization were performed individually in some studies. On the other hand, a number of papers published in the field endeavored to estimate process parameters accurately. To date, important work has been carried out to correlate TW and sensorial data in turning. Thus, a critical review should be performed for TCMS to explain the relationship between sensorial data and quality characteristics, for example, TW. The following conclusions were drawn from this exhaustive literature review:Despite there being important initiatives to evaluate TW, CFs, vibration, AE and SR, analysis, modeling and optimization were performed individually in some studies.

        <p>The cross interaction between cutting parameters, in addition to the effect of TW mechanisms and TW types, makes cutting operation complex. Considering turning, single cutter is exposed to high mechanical, chemical and thermal loads which lead to different wear developments. FW is accepted as the main tool life criteria since it shows progress on the flank face and weakens the main cutting edge. Therefore, it is required to analyze in detail the FW especially with sensor systems to investigate their correlation. In this way, online tracking and detection of the condition of wear can be determined and further prevention of failure can be possible.The cross interaction between cutting parameters, in addition to the effect of TW mechanisms and TW types, makes cutting operation complex.

        <p>The estimation of FW is a difficult task due to the time variant and non-linear structure of machining processes. This challenge pushes the researchers to observe the momentary alterations and protect the cutting tool from harsh conditions.

A subsection of TCMS is indirect systems, which are easy to implement and which provide effective solutions, when the previous papers are considered.The estimation of FW is a difficult task due to the time variant and non-linear structure of machining processes.
