        <p>The available magnetic field strength for high resolution NMR in persistent superconducting magnets has recently improved from 23.5 to 28 Tesla, increasing the proton resonance frequency from 1 to 1.2 GHz. For magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR, this is expected to improve resolution, provided the sample preparation results in homogeneous broadening. We compare two-dimensional (2D) proton detected MAS NMR spectra of four membrane proteins at 950 and 1200 MHz. We find a consistent improvement in resolution that scales superlinearly with the increase in magnetic field for three of the four examples. In 3D and 4D spectra, which are now routinely acquired, this improvement indicates the ability to resolve at least 2 and 2.5 times as many signals, respectively.The available magnetic field strength for high resolution NMR in persistent superconducting magnets has recently improved from 23.5 to 28 Tesla, increasing the proton resonance frequency from 1 to 1.2 GHz.

        <p>Protons not only have a high gyromagnetic ratio, but are also abundant in biological molecules, making them an ideal choice for detection [1,2]. Although this does indeed maximize sensitivity when defining sensitivity in terms of peak area, in solid samples the many strong proton-proton dipole couplings lead to broad spectra at magic-angle spinning (MAS) frequencies of below ~20 kHz [3], unless significant proton dilution is employed [4][5][6][7][8][9]. For proteins, the most common approach has been to perdeuterate during expression, and then introduce the protein to the desired concentration of H 2 O in D 2 O in order to reintroduce protons at exchangeable sites at a defined level. This works efficiently for most proteins, but becomes problematic for some membrane proteins due to the lack of exchange for the membrane embedded regions [10,11]. Thus far, the sample preparation has been the major bottleneck limiting the number of ssNMR studies of membrane proteins. Indeed, their expression yields are often particularly limited in perdeuterated media, and side-chain information is limited. Although improved resolution is observed with lower levels of protons at exchangeable sites, this only partly compensates for a loss in sensitivity [12,13].Protons not only have a high gyromagnetic ratio, but are also abundant in biological molecules, making them an ideal choice for detection [1,2].

        <p>A complementary strategy to proton dilution is to increase the MAS frequency [14-16] and the magnetic field in order to reduce spin relaxation occurring via spin flip-flops [17,18]. This places less stringent demands on proton dilution [19][20][21][22] and results in high sensitivity despite a reduction in sample amount to only 2 to 3 mg for 1.3 mm rotors spun up to 60 kHz MAS, as previously reviewed [23]. Further increases in the MAS have resulted in improved sensitivity per unit of sample, with 0.8 mm and 0.7 mm probes that deliver a spinning frequency over 100 kHz. It is not yet clear which MAS frequency will be found to be optimal, and indeed recent reports of a 0.6 mm probe indicate further improvement in relaxation properties at 126 kHz MAS leading to an average proton linewidth Biomolecules 2021, 11, 752 2 of 18 &lt; 100 Hz [24]. Bulk coherence lifetimes were shown to increase further with 150 kHz MAS using a 0.5 mm rotor [25].A complementary strategy to proton dilution is to increase the MAS frequency [14-16] and the magnetic field in order to reduce spin relaxation occurring via spin flip-flops [17,18].

        <p>Tailored isotopic labeling of side chain protons is more challenging, relying on control of labeling during protein expression, which depends on the expression media, but also on metabolic processes of the expression system. The group of Reif realized that the conditions used for perdeuterated protein expression results in approximately 10 percent CHD 2 labeling of methyl sites and leads to spectacular resolution of side chain proton resonances [8,26]. The strategy can be improved by use of a methyl precursor and optimization of the level of H 2 O during expression [27]. Generalization of side chain labeling via expression in deuterated glucose or glycerol with defined H 2 O levels was dubbed Reduced Adjoining Protonation (RAP), and allowed detection at all side chain sites [28 -30]. A related approach, fractional deuteration (FD), involves the use of protonated glucose in an otherwise deuterated expression medium. Protonation levels are 10 to 40 percent, with the alpha proton labeling sourced primarily from the water [31]. The inverse FD approach has also been investigated at 60 and 111 kHz [10,32].Tailored isotopic labeling of side chain protons is more challenging, relying on control of labeling during protein expression, which depends on the expression media, but also on metabolic processes of the expression system.

        <p>Methyl protons can provide valuable information that defines the protein fold [36,38]. Stereo-Array Isotope Labeling (SAIL) provides further control of protonation, and for valine, leads to reduction of proton linewidths by a factor of 2 to 7 [39]. The high cost of SAIL can be offset by the use of smaller rotors [40]. For alpha proton labeling, alpha proton exchange via transamination (Î±PET) leads to improved linewidths at 55-100 kHz, albeit with scrambling of the label for certain residue types [41].Methyl protons can provide valuable information that defines the protein fold [36,38].

        <p>Full protonation is by far the most straightforward approach, which even allows expression in insect [42,43] or mammalian media [44]. Several reports first proposed the detection of side-chain protons in the 40 to 60 kHz regime [45][46][47], but the relatively low resolution for fully protonated samples in this spinning range limits applications. The development of 0.7 mm probes capable of spinning above 100 kHz led to a resolution improvement that has expanded applications to structure determination of proteins, and analysis of materials without isotopic enrichment [48][49][50][51].Full protonation is by far the most straightforward approach, which even allows expression in insect [42,43] or mammalian media [44].

        <p>Nevertheless, it is clear that further increase in both the spinning frequency and the magnetic field could improve proton resolution, in particular for strongly coupled spins with similar frequencies [52]. A theoretical framework for efficient line shape calculation involving many spins was applied recently to proteins [53]. Restricted state-space simulations can also be used to simulate large spin clusters necessary for accurate linewidth determination [54,55]. Such simulations apply to rigid systems, and when dynamics are present, additional sources of spin relaxation exist [56].Nevertheless, it is clear that further increase in both the spinning frequency and the magnetic field could improve proton resolution, in particular for strongly coupled spins with similar frequencies [52].

        <p>The presence of dynamical processes is a well-known phenomenon in membrane proteins [57]. Furthermore, the sample homogeneity in membrane bilayer preparations of membrane proteins is often less ideal than microcrystalline or sedimented proteins, for which several detailed reports have already investigated the effects of magnetic field and spinning frequency for protonated and partly deuterated proteins [29,46]. Particularly narrow lines similar to microcrystalline preparations were reported for the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin [21], an apparent exception to the usual situation.The presence of dynamical processes is a well-known phenomenon in membrane proteins [57].

        <p>The installation of 28 Tesla magnets provides an opportunity to quantify the expected improvements in resolution and sensitivity as observed in MAS spectra. For the purpose of separating peaks, the relevant parameter for comparison is the linewidth in ppm, since a given separation on the Hz scale decreases linearly with an increase in magnetic field. Are the spectra characterized by mainly inhomogeneous broadening, in which case similar spectral quality can be expected? Or are membrane protein spectra more often characterized by homogeneous broadening that is expected to either scale down with field (coherent effects) or remain more or less the same (incoherent effects)?The installation of 28 Tesla magnets provides an opportunity to quantify the expected improvements in resolution and sensitivity as observed in MAS spectra.

        <p>We approach this topic by presenting proton detected spectra of four membrane proteins, two helical proteins, the matrix protein 2 (M2) from influenza A, and a citrate sensor (CitA) from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans and two beta barrels, the human voltage dependent anionic channel (hVDAC) and opacity associated protein 60 (Opa60) from Neisseria Gonorrhoeae. In each case, we compare the spectra taken from a single fully protonated sample packed in a 0.7 mm rotor and recorded at a 950 MHz spectrometer, and at a 1200 MHz spectrometer. A variety of samples including fibrils, capsids, and membrane proteins are currently the subject of a similar comparison between 850 MHz and 1200 MHz [58].We approach this topic by presenting proton detected spectra of four membrane proteins, two helical proteins, the matrix protein 2 (M2) from influenza A, and a citrate sensor (CitA) from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans and two beta barrels, the human voltage dependent anionic channel (hVDAC) and opacity associated protein 60 (Opa60) from Neisseria Gonorrhoeae.

        <p>Spectra and measured linewidths presented in Figures 123456were acquired either at a 950 MHz spectrometer or a 1200 MHz spectrometer as follows. Measurements at 950 MHz were recorded using a Bruker Avance III HD spectrometer equipped with a 0.7 mm HCDN MAS probe using 156 kHz proton, 80 kHz carbon and 35 kHz nitrogen rf-fields for hard pulses. Measurements at 1200 MHz were recorded using a Bruker Avance NEO spectrometer equipped with a 0.7 mm HCN probe using 144 kHz proton, 83 kHz carbon and 78 kHz nitrogen rf-fields for hard pulses. All spectra were recorded at 100 kHz MAS using a cooling gas flow of 500 lph and a temperature of 260 to 265 K to maintain a sample temperature near 288 K, based on the chemical shift of potassium bromide [59]. For all spectra, 25 kHz Mississippi [60] water suppression (100 to 200 ms), 23 kHz Swf-TPPM proton decoupling during acquisition of the indirect dimension, and 10 kHz WALTZ-16 heteronuclear decoupling during acquisition were employed. Spectra were processed in 
            <rs type="software">Bruker topspin</rs> versions 
            <rs type="version">3 and 4</rs>, and analyzed in Sparky [61].

        <p>Drift in the magnetic field was compensated in processing with linear drift correction using a script directly in 
            <rs type="software">Topspin</rs> [62]. This was particularly important for Opa60 spectra at 1200 MHz, since data acquisition of Opa60 took place in the first few weeks after charging, and the magnet was still drifting at over 200 Hz per hour, and the drift rate was changing every day. For the other samples the drift had reached a stable linear value over the acquisition time. For the M2 sample, a spectrum was rerecorded with a drift rate below 10 Hz per hour, and the linewidths were unchanged. Details of the acquisitions including CP transfer parameters are summarized in Tables S1 andS2 in the Supplementary Materials.

        <p>For linewidth determination, no apodization was used, and the time domain signal was sampled far enough (&gt;3 times T 2 ) to minimally impact the linewidth determination. For example, for Opa60, spectra from both spectrometers were sampled in the proton dimension to 9.1 ms for linewidth determination, and for nitrogen linewidth analysis, 12.5 ms nitrogen sampling was used at 1200 MHz and 15.75 ms for the 950 MHz spectra, ensuring a valid comparison in ppm, and &gt;3 times T 2 for the narrowest signal identified. The 2D spectra were apodized with a cosine squared function (VDAC) or an 18 degree shifted cosine squared function (M2, Opa60, CitA) using the Qsine [63,64] function: sin [(ÏÏ/SSB)t + Ï/SSB)] with SSB of 2 or 2.5 in order to minimally change the line shapes in 2D.For linewidth determination, no apodization was used, and the time domain signal was sampled far enough (&gt;3 times T 2 ) to minimally impact the linewidth determination.

The total Hamiltonian of N spins consisted of the sum of the N isotropic chemical shift Hamiltonians and 0.5 Ã N Ã (N -1) homonuclear dipolar Hamiltonians. The distances and the relative orientations of the different Principal Axis systems of the dipolar interactions with respect to molecular frame were calculated according to the coordinates in the pdb 2N70, as detailed in the Supplementary Materials. In calculations, the dipolar interactions between methyl protons was averaged by 3 because of the inner rotation of the group [72]. The initial and the measured operators were I + and I -, respectively. For measuring the full width of the peaks at half maximum (FWHM), the simulated signal was multiplied by a mono-exponential function corresponding 32 Hz FWHM for Figure 7A-E, and 16 Hz for the angle dependence of Figure 7F, for which 16 Hz was used. Time domain simulations were transferred into the frequency domain with the Fourier transform. The illustration of the selected proton spins is shown in the supplemental information Figure S2.

As a starting structure, we used the protein database (pdb) 6BKL and re-moved the small molecule drug, keeping twelve H 2 O molecules, including ten that are posed between residues H37 and I33 inside the tetramer structure of the protein. G34 is within the previously reported H 2 O bearing region of this structure. To accelerate the DFT and Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital (GIAO) [75] based NMR calculations, a reduced set of atoms spanning residues I33 to W41, were used. The starting structure was first fully geometry optimized with semi-empirical and later with DFT methods using hybrid functionals, and basis sets available in 
            <rs type="software">Gaussian</rs> 16. The structure was optimized stepwise, first by a semi-empirical PM6 [76], and later by a hybrid B3LYP [77] level of theory with the 6-311G++2d,p basis set. The proton chemical shifts were calculated using TMS (31.882 ppm) as reference for protons from the chemical shielding tensor of the GIAO results. (See Supplementary Materials for structure and shielding tensors). We observe a correlation coefficient R 2 of 0.97 for proton resonances in residue H37 (see Supplementary Materials Table S3), which in turn produces a great match with experimental and simulated dipolar interactions observed in Figure 7C for the 8.193 ppm proton chemical shift. The water protons near G34 have DFT calculated shifts of 3.21 and 1.95 ppm.

        <p>Substantial improvement in resolution is observed at 1200 MHz, which is generally better than a linear linewidth reduction in ppm as compared with the 950 MHz data. An improvement in sensitivity for the (H)NH and (H)CH spectra of about 1.3 Â± 0.5 is observed as compared with the 950 MHz instrument, consistent with the expected B 0 1.5 dependence. The sensitivity was evaluated based on the initial 1D spectrum (after both CP steps). The large variation emphasizes the importance of carefully optimizing the RF pulses and cross polarization transfer steps, and the need for a better proton sensitivity standard for ultra-fast MAS NMR.

        <p>The M2 protein from Influenza A is a small viroporin that is the target of two adamantane-based drugs [78], and for which development of additional inhibitors is of interest [79]. Figure 1 shows a comparison of 2D (H)NH and (H)CH spectra of the 18-60 construct of M2 in 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC) lipid bilayers [65]. To evaluate the improvement in spectral resolution, we selected several isolated peaks and compared the proton linewidths. A consistent reduction in the linewidths in Hz is observed, indicating an improvement in resolution that exceeds the ratio of the magnetic fields.

        <p>The human voltage dependent anion channel (hVDAC) is a 19-stranded beta barrel that mediates metabolite flux across the outer mitochondrial membrane. Preparations where 2D lipid crystalline arrays can be observed in negative stain electron micrographs result in particularly well-resolved spectra [67,80]. Figure 3 shows the proton detected spectra of an Î±-PET labeled sample of the 32 kDa membrane protein hVDAC.

For Opa60, we find that after correcting for the different recycle delays used on the spectrometers, the sensitivity stays roughly the same (signal-to-noise ratio of 0.9 for (H)NH, 1.0 for (H)CH). However, the final CP transfer before detection was shorter for both spectra on the 1200 MHz machine, thus rendering our calculations a lower boundary for sensitivity improvement.

        <p>We also compare the resolution of nitrogen resonances as a function of magnetic field. It is not immediately obvious if the lines are inhomogeneous and expected to remain the same with higher field, or homogeneous, in which case we may hope for an improvement in linewidth as measured in ppm. The situation, of course, depends upon the particular sample being studied. We find that for three of the four samples, a clear improvement in the nitrogen and carbon resolution is observed at 1200 MHz, which is equal to or better than the ratio of magnetic fields, 1.26. Several example 13 C linewidths are displayed in Figures 1, 2 and4, and projections of the 15 N dimensions of the (H)NH spectra of Figures 1234are shown in Figure 6. The source of the observed improvement in the 15 N linewidth as measured in Hz is unclear. However, we have noted that the 15 N linewidth of fully samples is also highly sensitive to the magic angle setting. The fourth protein, Opa60, showed a reduced improvement, as measured in ppm. This is explained by a larger inhomogeneous contribution to the line, and to a limited extent could also be due to the strong field drift of the 1200 MHz instrument, which invariably has a small nonlinear component after charging the magnet. The other three membrane protein samples were recorded after the magnet drift stabilized. The linear component of the drift was removed using a drift correction script in

        <p>In MAS NMR spectra, the proton linewidth is determined primarily from the influence of many strong proton-proton dipolar couplings, which are not completely averaged by the MAS. It was derived by van Vleck that a moment expansion [84] can be used for the derivation of linewidths, and the approach was later applied for MAS [85][86][87][88][89]. It was recently shown that a relatively quantitative determination of linewidths in ubiquitin could be obtained with a second moment approach for rigid parts of the protein [53]. Although much more computationally expensive, linewidths can also be simulated by solution of the equation of motion, propagating the density operator, and using numerical methods for a small number of spins, on the order of 10 spins [53,90]. Here, for simplicity, and so that we can easily simulate off the magic angle, we chose a numerical approach using up to 12 spins. From this, the trends in linewidth can be tracked with respect to increases in either the spinning frequency or the magnetic field. Although the results are not expected to be quantitative with only 12 spins, the simulations do capture the trends with respect to spinning frequency and magnetic field and can be used as an indication for the expected resolution at higher magnetic field. Similar simulations for three to four spins were reported before in Asami et al. [29], and for nine methyl proton spins in Xue et al. [52], in which the influence of chemical shift separation was investigated experimentally by measuring at 11.75 and 23.5 T. Particular sensitivity and resolution improvement was seen for cases that transition from strong-to weak-coupling limits. The strong coupling regime occurs when the chemical shift separation between dipolar coupled spins is small compared with the dipolar linewidth and can be particularly relevant for CH 2 moieties [53].In MAS NMR spectra, the proton linewidth is determined primarily from the influence of many strong proton-proton dipolar couplings, which are not completely averaged by the MAS.

        <p>Figure 7 shows the simulated linewidth of the three protons of glycine, including up to 12 spins in the simulation, and over a range of magnetic fields and either at the magic angle (âÎ¸ R = 0) or with deviations up to Â±0.075 â¢ (Figure 7F). The 12 spins in the simulation were selected based on the alpha helical conformation near G34 of M2 from pdb 2N70, taking the closest protons. The simulated spectra of Figure 7 display the complex line shapes noted previously [52], however, in the following, we evaluate only the width at half height as the most characteristic parameter affecting resolution. Note that the pdb 2N70 is the N31 variant of the protein; however, since the purpose of the simulation is to explore the effect on the linewidth for different magnetic fields and spinning frequencies, the particular coordinates are not important. We do not propose a quantitative explanation of the linewidths, since these depend strongly on the geometry and the chemical shifts, as investigated before [52], and the structure for these conditions has not been reported. With 12 spins, the linewidth determination has not completely converged, but reaches about 80 percent of the measured values, indicating that including 12 spins is likely sufficient to draw conclusions about the effects of magnetic field, spinning frequency and angle misset, even though we do not know the exact coordinates and chemical shifts, and therefore cannot expect a quantitative correspondence.

        <p>Nevertheless, we do expect a reasonable simulation to result in linewidths that are similar to the measured values of 190 to 220 Hz for the glycine amide and alpha protons. The simulated amide linewidth of 161 Hz (Figure 7A) can be compared with the measured value of 191 Hz (Figure 1C). For the glycine alpha protons, the difference is much larger, with simulated linewidths of ~75 Hz that are far from the measured ~216 Hz (Figure 1A). Any magic angle misset during the measurement would bring the agreement closer, but not enough to bring the numbers into agreement (see below). The geometry of most of the closest spins is well defined by the alpha helical structure of the protein. However, looking at the structure 2N70, there is a void near the G34 alpha protons that would certainly be filled by either water or a side-chain of a neighboring helix, since there is still uncertainty in the solid-state NMR structure. Adding two protons to this void, representing water or methylene protons, results in better agreement (Figure 7B-C) both for the amide and particularly for the alpha protons, emphasizing the sensitivity of the linewidth simulations to the arrangement of spins. Different chemical shifts were entered for the additional protons, for B and C, as detailed in the supporting information. Since the chemical shifts of these added protons are unknown, we first performed the simulations setting the isotropic shifts to 4.6 ppm, near the value for bulk water. For comparison, we also simulated for the case of 3.2 and 2 ppm, which is the result of a DFT calculation in which a water molecule is found near G34. These values are typical of aliphatic protons, such that this also represents the case of a nearby protein side-chain. Note that the geometry in the DFT simulation differs from pdb 2N70; however, the water placement is similar in both cases, see supplemental Figures S5 andS6. A strong dependence of the aliphatic linewidths is observed S3). In B and C, two additional protons were added to fill a void near the G34 HÎ± protons.

For (A-E), 32 Hz Lorentzian line broadening was applied, and for (F), 16 Hz was applied, since the panel represents the linewidth in a spin echo.Nevertheless, we do expect a reasonable simulation to result in linewidths that are similar to the measured values of 190 to 220 Hz for the glycine amide and alpha protons. The simulated amide linewidth of 161 Hz (Figure 7A) can be compared with the measured value of 191 Hz (Figure 1C). For the glycine alpha protons, the difference is much larger, with simulated linewidths of ~75 Hz that are far from the measured ~216 Hz (Figure 1A). Any magic angle misset during the measurement would bring the agreement closer, but not enough to bring the numbers into agreement (see below). The geometry of most of the closest spins is well defined by the alpha helical structure of the protein. However, looking at the structure 2N70, there is a void near the G34 alpha protons that would certainly be filled by either water or a side-chain of a neighboring helix, since there is still uncertainty in the solid-state NMR structure. Adding two protons to this void, representing water or methylene protons, results in better agreement (Figure 7B-C) both for the amide and particularly for the alpha protons, emphasizing the sensitivity of the linewidth simulations to the arrangement of spins. Different chemical shifts were entered for the additional protons, for B and C, as detailed in the supporting information. Since the chemical shifts of these added protons are unknown, we first performed the simulations setting the isotropic shifts to 4.6 ppm, near the value for bulk water. For comparison, we also simulated for the case of 3.2 and 2 ppm, which is the result of a DFT calculation in which a water molecule is found near G34. These values are typical of aliphatic protons, such that this also represents the case of a nearby protein side-chain. Note that the geometry in the DFT simulation differs from pdb 2N70; however, the water placement is similar in both cases, see supplemental Figures S5 andS6. A strong dependence of the aliphatic linewidths is observed S3). In B and C, two additional protons were added to fill a void near the G34 HÎ± protons. In (B), these additional protons had chemical shift offsets of 4.6 ppm, whereas in (C), chemical shift offsets were set according to a DFT calculation (details in the Supplementary Materials). In (D), the full linewidth at half max (FWHM) of the amide proton is shown for four fields and MAS frequencies, with units of Hz. 12 spins were simulated. In (E), the same linewidths are shown in ppm. Panel (F) shows the sensitivity of the amide proton to magic angle misset. 12 spins were simulated at a spinning frequency of 100 kHz, for the indicated spectrometer frequencies.

        <p>Commercial probes have been found to reach an accuracy of about 0.1 â¢ or more using potassium bromide [91,92], and the impact of such magic angle deviations has been noted for proton detection of biomolecular samples [93,94]. The proton line broadening present for even a small error in the magic angle prompted the use of methods to accurately adjust the magic angle directly using the sample of interest [95,96]. A small deviation of about 0.025 â¢ from the magic angle (Figure 7F) brings the amide proton to near perfect agreement with the measured value.Commercial probes have been found to reach an accuracy of about 0.1 â¢ or more using potassium bromide [91,92], and the impact of such magic angle deviations has been noted for proton detection of biomolecular samples [93,94].

        <p>The linewidth becomes particularly sensitive to the magic angle in the fast spinning regime (Figure 7F). In this case, a natural linewidth of only 16 Hz was assumed, which represents a spin echo applied on the channel, removing some hypothetical inhomogeneous contribution to the line. The simulations of Figure 7 show that a misset of 0.05 â¢ results in 10 percent or more increase in linewidth at 100 kHz MAS.The linewidth becomes particularly sensitive to the magic angle in the fast spinning regime (Figure 7F).

        <p>This observation led us to adjust the spinning angle for each sample based on the proton T 2 , which upon initial comparison yields similar or slightly inferior results as compared with optimization from J-modulated spectra for fully protonated samples [96]. A comparison of the two methods is shown in Figure S4. Setting the angle using J-modulated spectra for the M2 sample did not significantly change the linewidths. We followed the following procedure to set the angle. First, the sample is spun to 100 kHz, and the variable temperature gas set to the desired value. Then, only after the probe temperature is allowed to equilibrate for at least one hour is the angle adjusted in order to minimize the homogeneous component of the proton linewidth. In fully protonated membrane proteins, the homogeneous proton T 2 (T 2 ) is typically 2 to 3 ms, such that a spin echo on the proton channel of about 3 ms retains sufficient sensitivity for optimization of the angle. We therefore adjusted the angle by maximizing the amide T 2 for the bulk proton signal, by insertion of a Hahn echo directly after the CP-HSQC. Typically, the relaxation delay (during the Hahn echo) was set to 3 ms, and 32 or 64 scans were needed at each step in the angle adjustment. The method is similar to an approach based on scalar and dipolar oscillations [96], except that in the T 2 method there are no signal oscillations allowing selection of any echo time. Although the J-modulation method is more sensitive to angle deviations, the T 2 -based method may be more helpful when the angle setting is far from the magic angle, since the J-modulation method oscillates with angle deviations, whereas the T 2 -based method produces a monotonically increasing function towards the optimal value.This observation led us to adjust the spinning angle for each sample based on the proton T 2 , which upon initial comparison yields similar or slightly inferior results as compared with optimization from J-modulated spectra for fully protonated samples [96].

        <p>The improvement in sensitivity and resolution available with the 1200 MHz spectrometer will broaden the applicability of the method or reduce the required instrument time. The theoretical sensitivity improvement alone of about 40 percent already leads to a twofold time efficiency. On top of this effect, the improvement for a multi-dimensional dataset grows with the product of the improvement in each dimension. Three of the four membrane proteins we investigated here showed clear improvement in nitrogen linewidths measured in Hz, which are dominated by homogeneous effects, such that the resolution measured in ppm scales superlinearly with the ratio of magnetic fields. For protons the linewidth in Hz also improves. This means that for the typical 3D or 4D dataset required for analysis of complex protein spectra, a conservative 26% improvement (compared with a 950 MHz instrument) grows to an improvement that is better than a factor of 2 or better than 2.5, respectively. This is expected to result in a dramatic improvement in the ability of MAS NMR to address larger proteins, without the need for even higher spectral dimensions.The improvement in sensitivity and resolution available with the 1200 MHz spectrometer will broaden the applicability of the method or reduce the required instrument time.
