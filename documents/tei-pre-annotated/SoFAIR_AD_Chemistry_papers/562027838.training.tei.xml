        <p>T he molecular dynamics simulation technique has become an indispensable tool in natural sciences, offering a spatio-temporal resolution unmatched by any experimental technique 1 . A major bottleneck of molecular dynamics is the limited time and length scales that are accessible. To overcome this limitation, coarse-grained (CG) models representing groups of atoms by effective beads, have achieved widespread use 2 . The Martini model is among the most popular CG models in the field of biomolecular simulation, due to its easy-to-use building block principle. Martini relies on a four-to-one mapping scheme (that is, on average four heavy atoms and associated hydrogens are mapped into one CG bead), and has been parametrized using a top-down approach with thermodynamic partitioning data as the main target 3,4 . Nonbonded interactions between neutral beads of Martini are solely described by Lennard-Jones potentials, while charged beads also include Coulombic interactions. The interaction strength of the Lennard-Jones potential (that is, its well depth) is used to discriminate between different levels of polarity of the CG beads. The model features four main classes of CG bead types, denoted C, N, P and Q representing nonpolar, intermediately polar, polar and charged chemical groups, respectively 4 . Sublabels are used to make a further distinction within a class in terms of degree of polarity or hydrogen donor/acceptor capabilities. In principle, all beads are the same size, denoted regular (R) beads. By way of exception, special small (S) beads were introduced to model ring-like compounds for which a four-to-one mapping scheme is inadequate 4 . To reproduce correct stacking and hydrogen-bonding distances between nucleotides, even smaller tiny (T) beads were found necessary 5 . Parametrization of the cross-interactions between S and T beads with R beads, however, was done on an ad hoc basis.T he molecular dynamics simulation technique has become an indispensable tool in natural sciences, offering a spatio-temporal resolution unmatched by any experimental technique 1 .

        <p>The Martini force field is used in a wide range of applications in diverse fields including structural biology [6][7][8] , biophysics 9,10 , biomedicine 11 , nanotechnology 12,13 and materials design 14,15 . With its growing use, however, a number of shortcomings of the Martini model have recently been identified. One of the most important problems is the observation that certain molecules tend to interact too strongly. This has been reported for proteins and carbohydrates in solution, as well as for membrane embedded proteins [16][17][18] . The origin lies among others in small but systematic deviations in packing and intermolecular interactions 19 . Besides, the coverage of chemical space for broader applications was uneven, and in some cases, such as selectivity of nucleobase pairing 5,20 , consistency was difficult to obtain given the limited bead types and sizes. To alleviate these problems, we undertook a rebalancing of all nonbonded interaction terms of the Martini model, including the addition of new beads and labels. The new version, called Martini 3, enables more accurate simulations of molecular systems in general. In this paper, we present the key features of Martini 3 combined with examples of new applications and improvements in relation to the previous Martini model.The Martini force field is used in a wide range of applications in diverse fields including structural biology [6][7][8] , biophysics 9,10 , biomedicine 11 , nanotechnology 12,13 and materials design 14,15 .

        <p>Reparametrization of the beads. In Martini 3, the parametrization strategy was based on the construction of prototype The coarse-grained Martini force field is widely used in biomolecular simulations. Here we present the refined model, Martini 3 (http://cgmartini.nl), with an improved interaction balance, new bead types and expanded ability to include specific interactions representing, for example, hydrogen bonding and electronic polarizability. The updated model allows more accurate predictions of molecular packing and interactions in general, which is exemplified with a vast and diverse set of applications, ranging from oil/water partitioning and miscibility data to complex molecular systems, involving protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions and material science applications as ionic liquids and aedamers. models of polar and nonpolar molecules in all three Martini resolutions. Self-(R-R, S-S, and T-T) and cross-interactions (R-S, R-T and S-T) of the different bead sizes were optimized to be well-balanced (Supplementary Notes). In terms of chemical types, the beads were separated into three blocks: organic, ions and water (Supplementary Notes). The organic (containing P, N and C beads) and ion (Q beads) blocks have been subjected to independent parametrizations, where different trends in self-interaction, solvation and transfer free energy on bead size change were included (Supplementary Notes). In contrast to the previous version, water is defined as a separate bead type (called W), which enables optimization of water properties independently from other targets; for example, the freezing of water at room temperature (a problem sometimes encountered with the previous water model) no longer occurs. In addition, it is available in three different sizes as well (Supplementary Notes). Together with this optimization strategy, the new Martini 3 model also features a fully revised interaction matrix (Supplementary Notes) and new intermediate interaction levels, added to smoothen the transition between chemical types (Supplementary Notes). Bead assignment and validation of the models were not only based on experimental transfer free energies, but also included solvent miscibility data (Supplementary Notes and Supplementary Results) and a series of benchmark tests, ranging from structural properties of bilayers to dimerization potentials of mean force (PMF) of proteins (Methods, Supplementary Notes and Supplementary Results).Reparametrization of the beads.

        <p>The improved interaction balance between regular and smaller bead types is illustrated by the close to ideal mixing behavior of pure solvents composed of molecules mapped at different resolutions (Fig. 1a). Integration of radial distribution functions, defined as Kirkwood-Buff integrals (G ij ), are used here to quantify the degree of miscibility of the multi-resolution liquid water model (Fig. 1b). Theoretically, pair differences in Kirkwood-Buff integrals (ΔG ij ) should be equal to zero for all i,j pairs in ideal mixtures 21,22 while real mixtures that closely approach ideal behavior (such as benzene-toluene) show values around ±1 cm 3 mol -1 (ref. 22 ). Our multi-resolution water model shows ΔG ij ≈ -0.3 cm 3 mol -1 , indicating that the balance achieved with the new parametrization closely captures an ideal mixing behavior.The improved interaction balance between regular and smaller bead types is illustrated by the close to ideal mixing behavior of pure solvents composed of molecules mapped at different resolutions (Fig. 1a).

        <p>The accuracy of CG models containing ring or branched fragments, which rely heavily on smaller bead types, is also greatly increased in Martini 3. For example, the binary mixing behavior of various solvents (Supplementary Results) and the transfer free energies of many linear, branched and ring-like compounds (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Results) are now in very good agreement with experimental data. The mean absolute error of transfer free energies compared to the experimental data is 2 kJ mol -1 , with 86% of the molecules presenting errors lower than 3 kJ mol -1 .The accuracy of CG models containing ring or branched fragments, which rely heavily on smaller bead types, is also greatly increased in Martini 3.

        <p>Another benefit of the recalibrated interactions is the disappearance of the artificially large desolvation free energy barriers that contribute to slow dissociation processes of the previous Martini 2 models. The problem that was initially observed in dimerization of nucleobases 5,19 is thus solved, as highlighted by the comparison of Martini 2 and Martini 3 PMFs between cytosine and guanine (left panel of Fig. 1d). Note that there is room for further improvement, as the free energy minima of the CG PMF profiles with Martini 3 are shifted relative to the all-atom profiles because the bead sizes representing nitrogen-containing groups are not optimal to reproduce hydrogen-bonding distances. In addition, the difference between C-G and G-G base pairs is not as large as in the atomistic case (roughly 20 kJ mol -1 ). However, it is still large enough (roughly 8 kJ mol -1 ) to provide specificity. The proper balancing of R, S and T beads in Martini 3 also indicates that the mapping choice of an arbitrary molecule to its Martini representation is now better defined. S and T beads are not only suited to represent ring-like compounds, but also used for cases involving 3-to-1 and 2-to-1 mapping of linear and branched chemical groups (Supplementary Notes).Another benefit of the recalibrated interactions is the disappearance of the artificially large desolvation free energy barriers that contribute to slow dissociation processes of the previous Martini 2 models.

        <p>Covering the chemical space with new beads and labels. Together with a thorough revision of the interaction strengths, in Martini 3, we extend the number of chemical bead types and the ability to modify the bead properties depending on the chemical details of the underlying moieties. Each P, N and C class now has six bead types with different degrees of polarity, which enables a more precise definition of different chemical groups by assigning them to certain bead types. Additionally, we introduce a new X-class of beads to model halo-compounds (Supplementary Notes). In the previous version of Martini, some of the bead types were already subclassified according to their ability to act as hydrogen bond donor, acceptor or both. This property can be now attributed to all bead types of an intermediate or polar nature (N or P class). The effective interaction strength between donor and acceptor pairs is increased, whereas donor-donor and acceptor-acceptor pairs are weakened (Supplementary Notes). For example, Martini 3 correctly reproduces the trends in hydrogen bond-based pairing of nucleobases 5,20 without the use of special-purpose beads specifically for nucleobases (right panel of Fig. 1d). Note that chemical groups that can act as both donor and acceptor at the same time are always represented by the pure beads of the P and N class in Martini 3.Covering the chemical space with new beads and labels.

        <p>Next to the fine-tuning based on hydrogen-bonding capabilities, we introduce the possibility to change the interactions based on the electronic polarizability. Depending on inductive or conjugate effects caused by chemical functionalization, nonpolar molecules can be polarized; that is, they can acquire an electron-donor (or 'enriched' , label 'e') or electron-acceptor (or 'vacancy' , label 'v') character, which can promote preferential interactions. Polarizable groups in Martini 3 can be distinguished through the label 'e/v' that can only be applied to the C-and X-class. A nice example of their application is the strong and specific interaction between electron-donor and electron-acceptor aromatic rings in aedamers, a class of molecules that have been studied extensively in the context of biomimetic folding and self-assembly 23,24 . The use of 'e/v' allows Martini 3 to capture the preferential interaction between 1,5-dialkoxynaphthalene (DAN) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) (left panel of Fig. 2a) experimentally observed via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titration 23 and atomistic simulation data. Self-assembly of amide-linked tetramers shows preferential formation of alternating stacks of DAN and NDI, which is also measured by NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry investigations 24 . On top of hydrogen bonding and electron polarization labels, all beads can have their self-interaction fine-tuned by other sublabels (as further described in the Supplementary Notes).Next to the fine-tuning based on hydrogen-bonding capabilities, we introduce the possibility to change the interactions based on the electronic polarizability.

        <p>Chemical groups carrying monovalent charges +1/-1 are represented in Martini by the class of Q beads (Supplementary Notes). The original Martini model only considers monovalent ions, and was solely optimized for regular bead sizes that represented small ions and their first hydration shell. In Martini 3, charged groups can have R, S or T sizes. The tiny size category allows modeling of small, bare ions, enabling applications that involve ion binding where (part of) the hydration shell is lost. This feature is exemplified by the binding of sodium ions (represented by a charged tiny bead) to a buried small cavity localized in the core of the adenosine A 2A receptor (Fig. 2b). X-ray crystallographic 25 and ligand binding assays 26 confirm the importance of sodium ions for the structure and for the allosteric modulation of the A 2A receptor. Note that an extensive validation of the lipid models in Martini 3 was performed to allow simulations of transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins (Supplementary Results).Chemical groups carrying monovalent charges +1/-1 are represented in Martini by the class of Q beads (Supplementary Notes).

        <p>In addition to the smaller sizes, the Q class was also expanded to five bead types, following the classical Hofmeister series trend 27,28 (Supplementary Notes and Supplementary Results). At one extreme, the Q5 bead may be used to represent hard monovalent ions with the smallest polarizability, for example inorganic ions such as R 2 PO 4 -. At the other end of the Martini-Hofmeister series, the Q1 type models polarizable soft monovalent ions, such as N(CH 3 ) 4 + , and includes ion-π interactions via the Lennard-Jones potential. Such differences in behavior of the different Q-bead types are exemplified by molecular dynamics simulations of the anion transfer between aqueous solutions and organophosphonium-based ionic liquids (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Results). Harder ions such as Cl -(modeled as TQ5 with -1 charge) tend to stay in the water phase, together with Na + ions (TQ5 + bead). In contrast, softer ions such as ClO 4 -(Q2 -bead) can exchange with Br -(SQ4 -bead) or (partially) PF 6 -(Q1 -bead) from the ionic liquid phase. In the case of the biphasic system using trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bromide ([P 66614 ][Br]), direct comparison to experimental data shows good agreement for the anion transfer trends 28,29 . The new Q-bead types also impact biologically relevant systems, as exemplified by preferential cation-π interaction between choline groups (Q1 + bead) of phosphatidylcholine lipids and aromatic residues of the Bacillus thuringiensis phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (BtPI-PLC). In the previous version, such specific interactions between soft ions and aromatic molecules were solely included in the recently updated polarizable Martini implementation 30 . However, in Martini 3, the different Q-bead types allow easier (implicit) incorporation of such interactions without the need for additional partial charges.In addition to the smaller sizes, the Q class was also expanded to five bead types, following the classical Hofmeister series trend 27,28 (Supplementary Notes and Supplementary Results).

        <p>On top of the new chemical types, all Q beads can use the hydrogen-bonding labels (called in this case 'p/n'). They represent organic charged molecules or fragments, such as R-CH 2 -COO -and R-CH 2 -NH 3 + , and also introduce modifications in the Hofmeister trends of the pure Q beads (Supplementary Notes). Positively charged hydrogen donors ('p' label) interact more strongly with nonpolar beads, as expected in cation-π interactions. On the other hand, negatively charged hydrogen acceptors ('n' label), have stronger interactions with neutral polar beads, mimicking the stronger hydrogen bonds with anions. To complete the ion block, we explicitly include a new D bead for divalent ions (such as Ca 2+ ), which are typically hard ions.On top of the new chemical types, all Q beads can use the hydrogen-bonding labels (called in this case 'p/n').

        <p>Another change in philosophy with respect to the previous Martini models is the definition of bonded interactions. Instead of using the center of mass of the mapped chemical groups to define the geometry of the molecule, we now use a size-shape concept aimed at preserving the volume of molecules in comparison to all-atom reference structures. This choice and the proper use of Martini 3 bead sizes (Supplementary Notes) lead to more realistic molecular packing. As a consequence, the hydration of protein pockets and channels is improved, as illustrated by the Fragaceatoxin C (FraC) nanopore inserted in a lipid bilayer (Fig. 3a). The pore of FraC remains open over the whole trajectory in Martini 3, as indicated by X-ray crystallography 31 and electro-osmotic flow assays 32 , while in Martini 2 it is closed.Another change in philosophy with respect to the previous Martini models is the definition of bonded interactions.

        <p>Another example of accurate packing is the stacking predictions of thiophene derivatives in bulk heterojunction solar cells composed of poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (Fig. 3b). The morphology of these organic solar cells is a determinant for high-efficiency devices 33 .

        <p>The use of bonds based on molecular volume and the appropriate choice of chemical bead types, sizes and labels also controls the interaction density of the model, which has an important impact on the strength of collective interactions between molecules 19 . To test to what extent the changes in nonbonded and bonded interactions reduce the over-estimated aggregation of proteins, we performed extensive simulations comprising solutions of soluble proteins as well as membrane embedded proteins. These systems were simulated under conditions in which proteins do not aggregate and, preferentially, stay as monomers. For soluble proteins (Fig. 3c), qualitative tests were performed with the headpiece domain of chicken villin 35 , and the modified and mutated cellulose-binding domain from Cellulomonas fimi (EXG-CBM), which is an example of a protein completely free of charged side chains that can maintain solubility, stability and function 36 . Trends are well captured in Martini 3, with both proteins mainly staying as monomers in pure water (with only counter-ions to neutralize the system in the case of villin). The villin headpiece showed salting-in behavior (that is, less aggregation) under addition of 0.4 M of NaCl, which was also observed for certain soluble proteins at low ionic strengths 37 . On the other hand, EXG-CBM only showed salting-out behavior (that is, more aggregation), which was expected based on experimental data 36 . In contrast, both proteins aggregate in Martini 2, forming a single and stable aggregate during the simulation.The use of bonds based on molecular volume and the appropriate choice of chemical bead types, sizes and labels also controls the interaction density of the model, which has an important impact on the strength of collective interactions between molecules 19 .

For soluble proteins (Fig. 3c), qualitative tests were performed with the headpiece domain of chicken villin 35 , and the modified and mutated cellulose-binding domain from Cellulomonas fimi (EXG-CBM), which is an example of a protein completely free of charged side chains that can maintain solubility, stability and function 36 . Trends are well captured in Martini 3, with both proteins mainly staying as monomers in pure water (with only counter-ions to neutralize the system in the case of villin). The villin headpiece showed salting-in behavior (that is, less aggregation) under addition of 0.4 M of NaCl, which was also observed for certain soluble proteins at low ionic strengths 37 . On the other hand, EXG-CBM only showed salting-out behavior (that is, more aggregation), which was expected based on experimental data 36 . In contrast, both proteins aggregate in Martini 2, forming a single and stable aggregate during the simulation.</p>
        <p>Polyleucine (K 2 -L 26 -K 2 ) was selected to evaluate the aggregation propensity in membranes. Experimental evidence with this transmembrane protein model indicates a preference for the monomeric state in a bilayer environment [38][39][40] . Both Martini 2 and 3 show that the hydrophobic mismatch between transmembrane length and membrane thickness can play a role in the aggregation, with Martini 3 showing a higher percentage of the monomeric state (Fig. 3d). To quantitatively evaluate the strength of protein-protein interactions in a membrane environment, we also considered the dimerization of four selected transmembrane helices: the transmembrane domains of the receptor tyrosine kinases EphA1 and ErbB1; the red blood cell protein glycophorin A (GpA); as well as the well-known model peptide WALP23 (left panel of Fig. 3e). For EphA1 and ErbB1, experimental dimerization free energies in a membrane environment have been estimated using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) 41,42 . For GpA, dimerization free energies range from around -15 kJ mol -1 (in various cell membrane environments) 43,44 to -31.5 kJ mol -1 (GALLEX assay in E. coli inner membranes) 45,46 or -50.6 kJ mol -1 (steric trap in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3 -phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers) 47 . WALP peptides have been characterized thoroughly during the past two decades, including their self-association 48 . For each one of the four peptide dimers, we compared experimental dimerization free energies with the free energies predicted by the Martini 2 and Martini 3 models. Martini 3 shows not only to be able to capture the correct trends, but also to quantitatively reproduce the experimental affinities. The binding mode also becomes improved as highlighted for GpA (right panel of Fig. 3e). The GpA homodimer structure with Martini 3 closely resembles experimental results obtained with NMR spectroscopy and crystallography [49][50][51] .Polyleucine (K 2 -L 26 -K 2 ) was selected to evaluate the aggregation propensity in membranes.

        <p>In summary, for both soluble and transmembrane proteins, we observed that the Martini 3 models are in much better agreement with experimental data than before. Another advantage of the current Martini 3 protein model is that the default bead type representing the protein backbone in Martini 3 (a regular P2 bead) no longer depends on the secondary structure. In addition, the representation of protein flexibility can now be improved by the use of Gō-like models 52 .In summary, for both soluble and transmembrane proteins, we observed that the Martini 3 models are in much better agreement with experimental data than before.

        <p>In this paper, we have described the new version of the Martini force field, which shows numerous improvements in relation to the previous version. However, inherent limitations to the process of coarse graining, related to transferability and representability problems [53][54][55] are still part of the model. An important drawback is the limited structural detail that is a consequence of representing multiple atoms with isotropic interaction sites. This is most noticeable for the Martini water model, which represents four water molecules with a single Lennard-Jones site and will certainly not capture any of the higher order structural correlations of real water. The role of explicit water in a CG model such as Martini is mostly to provide a good solvent for polar compounds resulting in realistic partitioning. For applications requiring finer details, structure-based CG models are more suitable 56,57 . Another fundamental limitation is the entropy-enthalpy compensation. The loss of internal degrees of freedom for groups of atoms represented by a CG bead inevitably reduces the entropy of the system. Since the Martini force field is based on reproducing free energies, this requires a concomitant reduction in the enthalpy. As consequence, inaccurate entropyenthalpy balance affects the temperature dependence of several properties and reduces the transferability to different state points.In this paper, we have described the new version of the Martini force field, which shows numerous improvements in relation to the previous version.

        <p>To probe transferability, we performed temperature-dependent calculations for a number of solvent systems as well as lipid membranes (Supplementary Results). Temperature-dependent properties, such as the heat expansion coefficient and heat capacity of water and n-octane, are very well captured by Martini 3, but this is not true for the hydrophobic effect that shows the opposite trend with respect to atomistic models, in line with previous findings 58 .

Simulation errors are estimated with bootstrapping while experimental data were obtained from the literature [41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48] . In the case of GpA, error was estimated by the mean absolute error of four independent experimental data [43][44][45][46][47] . A comparison between experimental and simulated binding modes of GpA is highlighted in the right panel.

        <p>Keeping these limitations in mind, Martini 3 offers a versatile and easy-to-use generic force field to simulate molecular processes at a semi-quantitative level of accuracy. In relation to the previous model, the excessive over-estimated aggregation 19 is substantially reduced. We expect that Martini 3 will allow for more realistic predictions of protein interactions, as well as more accurate simulations of molecular systems in general. The increased number of bead types and interaction levels makes the model even more versatile, covering a larger part of chemical space with appropriate building blocks. Based on this foundation, further optimizations are currently ongoing, including the use of Gō-potentials to alleviate limitations of protein conformational flexibility, a reoptimization of the bonded potentials of lipids and other biomolecular classes, as well as a compatible polarizable water model for applications requiring more realistic screening of electrostatic interactions. Finally, we foresee new application horizons for the Martini model in the field of materials science 64,65 and high-throughput drug design 66 .Keeping these limitations in mind, Martini 3 offers a versatile and easy-to-use generic force field to simulate molecular processes at a semi-quantitative level of accuracy.

        <p>CG models. CG mappings of small molecules were initially inspired by the standard Martini 2 models, when they were available. Due to the well-balanced properties of the regular (R), small (S) and tiny (T) beads in Martini 3, the CG models now follow more specific rules for mapping. For instance, over-representing 3-to-1 or 2-to-1 fragments by the usage of R beads is always avoided. Aromatic rings without substituents are composed of T beads and, in case of substituents, S beads are used. Aliphatic rings without substituents are usually based on S beads, which better reproduce their molecular shape. More technical details about the mapping rules and bead types used are given in the Supplementary Notes. As in the previous version of Martini 5,20,[67][68][69] , bonded parameters are based on atomistic simulations or high-resolution experimental data. The main difference in Martini 3 lies in the protocol to derive bond lengths, which are now based on matching overall volume and shape of the molecules (Supplementary Notes). In this spirit, the bonded parameters of the protein models were also slightly modified from the standard Martini 2.2 values 68,70 , including the addition of side chain corrections 71 , based on experimental reference structures. Backbone bead types do not depend on the secondary structure anymore, but are now represented by P2 beads, except for proline (SP1a), alanine (SP2, with an additional bead for the side chain) and glycine (SP1). Adapted versions of Gō-like models 72 or Elastic Networks 73 were used to maintain the tertiary protein structure. All CG protein models were constructed using Martinize2, described in Supplementary Codes. Lipid mapping was inspired by the previous Martini model 4,[74][75][76] , but now following the Martini 3 rules for mapping and also with adaptations in the bonded parameters inspired by the 'extensible model' of Carpenter et al. 77 .CG models.

        <p>Settings for the CG simulations followed, in general, the 'new' Martini set of simulation parameters 78 using the leap-frog algorithm 79 for integrating the equations of motion. The Verlet neighbor search algorithm 80 is used to update the neighbor list every 20 steps with a buffer tolerance of 0.005 kJ mol -1 ps -1 . For the Lennard-Jones terms, we used a cutoff scheme with a value of 1.1 nm and the Verlet cutoff scheme 81 for the potential-shift. Long range electrostatic interactions were treated with reaction field 82 or particle mesh Ewald 83 , with relative permittivity set to ε r = 15 and a cutoff value of 1.1 nm. Reaction field was used for most of the systems, except the ones explicitly mentioning particle mesh Ewald. Periodic boundary conditions were used in all three dimensions. For the production simulations, the velocity rescaling thermostat 84 (coupling time constant of 1.0 ps) and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat 85 (coupling time constant of 12.0 ps) were employed to maintain temperature and pressure, respectively. Except for equilibration runs, a time step of 20 fs was used for all systems. CG simulation settings are available as input files for

        <p>To parametrize the Lennard-Jones parameters of single beads and also test the Martini 3 CG models, many molecular systems and methods were used in this work. The overall iterative approach was not based in rigorous separation of calibration and validation groups. As Martini is based on pair interactions, it is hard to find simple systems that cover enough points in the interaction matrix for all bead size combinations. So, complex systems are not only used for validation but can also be part of the calibration. The tests performed were separated in 'tiers' , which represent systems with different level of complexity. In tier 0, isolate beads and simple molecules are mainly used for calibration of Lennard-Jones parameters, with balance of different bead sizes and thermodynamics data (for example, liquid-liquid partitioning and miscibility) used as the main targets. In the intermediate tier 1, bilayer properties are checked, together with qualitative tests, and applied to systems such as soluble and transmembrane proteins. These qualitative tests are designed as 'yes-or-no' questions to evaluate the overall quality of the force field. At the same time, some points in the interaction matrix were also tested and fine-tuned here. In the final tier 2, quantitative tests involving complex systems are performed, including comparisons with experimental or atomistic simulation data. Here most of the systems are considered for validation. For a complete overview of the parametrization strategy used, see the Supplementary Notes.

Here most of the systems are considered for validation. For a complete overview of the parametrization strategy used, see the Supplementary Notes. The Supplementary Notes provide details of the specific systems and methods used in the tests performed to parametrize and validate the new Martini 3 Lennard-Jones parameters.</p>
