        <p>New guidelines for testing "Deep eutectic solvents" toxicity and their effects on the environment and living beings,New guidelines for testing "Deep eutectic solvents" toxicity and their effects on the environment and living beings,</p>
        <p>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are solvents generally formed by mixing a variety of quaternary ammonium salts with a Brønsted or Lewis acid compound in certain proportion. They were described for the first time at the beginning of this century as an alternative to ionic liquids (ILs) in green chemistry and catalysis (Abbott et al., 2004;Xu et al., 2017). Since that time around 800 papers have been published about DES (Date of access to PubMed and Scopus: 15 July 2019), involving subjects like: i) synthesis of new DES including their physicochemical characterisation (Marset et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2012); ii) potential applications of DES as green solvent in biocatalysis (both, in presence or absence of enzymes and/or cells of biotechnological interest) (Gorke et al., 2008;Gutiérrez et al., 2010;Lindberg et al., 2010;Zhao et al., 2011;Lynam et al., 2017;Gotor-Fernández et al., 2019;Pätzold et al., 2019); iii) DES as ingredients for drugs synthesis, solubilization and delivery (Morrison et al., 2009;Pedro et al., 2019;Gutiérrez et al., 2019); iv) DES and/or NADES (Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents) as solvent for extraction of biomolecules like polysaccharides, proteins, alkaloids, phenolic compounds or other natural compounds like chitin, pigments, flavonoids, κ-carrageenan, dyes (Gu et al., 2014;Pena-Pereira et al., 2014;Zeng et al., 2014;García et al., 2016;Zhu et al., 2017;Zhuang et al., 2017;Saravana et al., 2018;Takla et al., 2018;Zdanowicz et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2018;Huang et al., 2019) or v) DES as media for structural studies of nucleic acids (Mamajanov et al., 2010;Zhao et al., 2013a;Zhao et al., 2013b). More recently, DES-based molecularly imprinted polymers or DES-functionalised nanotubes have been developed and implemented at industrial scale for the removal of contaminants from wastewater or for the screening on antibiotics in biological fluids like milk (AlOmar et al., 2017;Tang et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2018).Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are solvents generally formed by mixing a variety of quaternary ammonium salts with a Brønsted or Lewis acid compound in certain proportion.

        <p>Combinations of DES applications with other techniques or approaches such as nanoparticles/nanospheres and electrochemistry have also been reported (Nkuku and LeSuer, 2007;Abbott et al., 2009;Sheng et al., 2012). The main results described up to now reveal DESs as promising solvents not only for green chemical industries (Dai et al., 2013), but also for those related to cosmetics, food, pharmacy, biotechnology and biomedicine (Wagle et al., 2014;Cvjetko Bubalo et al., 2016;Li et al., 2016;Mbous et al., 2017;Aydin et al., 2018;Jablonský et al., 2018;Procentese et al., 2018;Santos et al., 2018;Yoo et al., 2018).Combinations of DES applications with other techniques or approaches such as nanoparticles/nanospheres and electrochemistry have also been reported (Nkuku and LeSuer, 2007;Abbott et al., 2009;Sheng et al., 2012).

        <p>In order to consider DESs as environmental friendly solvents, their real toxicity as well as their potential biodegradability must be stablished (Radošević et al., 2015). Studies regarding these facts have been performed to a lesser extent; mainly using prokaryotic microbes (Juneidi et al., 2016) and in some cases eukaryotic organisms (Radošević et al., 2016;Dai et al., 2014). Nevertheless, there is still controversy about their potential toxicity (Hayyan et al., 2013a). Whilst several reports support the theory that DESs are non-toxic, eco-friendly, biodegradable and benign solvents, others demonstrate the opposite (Hayyan et al., 2015;Hebert et al., 2016). In general terms, it has been assumed that they are not toxic and environmentally friendly because most of the DES components are naturally occurring, bio-renewable, biodegradable or can be bioassimilated.In order to consider DESs as environmental friendly solvents, their real toxicity as well as their potential biodegradability must be stablished (Radošević et al., 2015).

        <p>The standard protocols to study the cytotoxicity of new chemical components (such as the disk test) are not accurate in the case of DESs. The high viscosity, among other characteristics, makes the use of new methodologies to assess their biological toxicity essential. This microbiological study presents, for the first time, the continuous monitoring of various parameters (such as growth and pH) in liquid cultures with different concentrations of DES. This new protocol has revealed advantages in terms of biocompatibility, toxicity and tolerance.The standard protocols to study the cytotoxicity of new chemical components (such as the disk test) are not accurate in the case of DESs.

        <p>A recently described DES has been used in this study to optimize new protocols and guidelines for checking its toxicity. In brief, DES was synthesized using acetylcholine chloride (AcChCl):acetamide (1:2) as components. This was used as reaction medium to produce sulphonamides using a copper-catalysed process starting from triarylbismuthines, Na 2 S 2 O 5 and nitro compounds (Marset et al., 2019).A recently described DES has been used in this study to optimize new protocols and guidelines for checking its toxicity.

The concentrations used were 600 mM and 1.2 M, respectively, which correspond to those contained in the mixture of DES at 600 mM (maximum concentration at which cell growth was detected). DES, acetylcholine chloride and acetamide were sterilised by following two approaches: they were either added to the culture media before autoclaving them at 120 C for 30 minutes; or the DES was sterilized by UV and acetylcholine chloride and acetamide were filtered through 0.22 µm size filter and then added to the sterilised culture media. The inhibition effect of the DES, AcChCl and MeCONH 2 was estimated by using the inhibition index (I) defined as: I = (A o -A) / A o * 100% (Kommanee et al., 2012),acetylcholine chloride (AcChCl) and acetamide (MeCONH 2 ).

        <p>For this reason, the first analysis introduced in this study was the continuous checking of pH in buffered and unbuffered culture media supplemented with DES, acetylcholine chloride (AcChCl) or acetamide (MeCONH 2 ). The most dramatic pH depletion was detected in those unbuffered media in which DES or AcChCl were added to the culture media before autoclaving. Table 1 summarizes pH values at different time during the cell growth comparing buffered and unbuffered media. Even when the cultures were buffered, pH of the media containing DES or AcChCl decreased significantly (down to 4.4 in unbuffered DES-containing cultures and 4.5 in unbuffered and buffered AcChClcontaining cultures). The inoculation of the cultures and subsequent growth of the cells slightly increases the pH value as expected in the case of the controls and in the media containing MeCONH 2 (buffered and unbuffered).For this reason, the first analysis introduced in this study was the continuous checking of pH in buffered and unbuffered culture media supplemented with DES, acetylcholine chloride (AcChCl) or acetamide (MeCONH 2 ).

        <p>[TABLE 1] When the DES, AcChCl or MeCONH 2 were previously sterilised by UV or filtration respectively, and then added to the sterilised media, the changes of pH values were smaller (down to 5.3 as final pH in some of the cultures). In order to identify the magnitude of the contribution of autoclave and microbial metabolism to pH depletion, pH values were monitored in non-inoculated culture media containing two different concentrations of DES (150 mM and 600 mM). These cultures were incubated for the same period, under the same shaking and temperature conditions. After 24 hours of incubation, the final pH measured in sterile cultures with 600 mM of DES was 6.05 (Supplementary Table S1), which was much higher than the value for the same DES concentration inoculated with cells (Table 1). From the results displayed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1, it is possible to conclude that the sterilization process based on autoclave may promote DES hydrolysis and probably reactions involving AcChCl, which contribute to pH acidification. DES hydrolysis and the consequent pH depletion also take place during the incubation, due to the culture media (Supplementary Table S1). E. coli growth and its metabolic activity is also involved in pH depletion.[TABLE 1] When the DES, AcChCl or MeCONH 2 were previously sterilised by UV or filtration respectively, and then added to the sterilised media, the changes of pH values were smaller (down to 5.3 as final pH in some of the cultures).

        <p>coli cells grown in standard LB media (non-preadapted cells). This DES concentration was chosen based on the concentrations previously reported in the literature (Coleman et al., 2010). Cells were not able to grow under these conditions and the preliminary conclusion pointed out by the authors in this work was that 600 mM DES is toxic for this bacterium. It is important to highlight that microorganisms in general can induce specific reactions or pathways when they are exposed to compounds that are unusual in their natural environments or microcosmos in the laboratory. Considering this, several physiological studies were done to analyse the growth of pre-adapted E. coli cells. Thus, cells grown in the presence of 150 mM DES were used as inoculum for cultures containing 300 mM, etc. Figure 1 displays the growth curves of E. coli preadapted cells in LB containing different concentrations of DES.coli cells grown in standard LB media (non-preadapted cells).

        <p>[FIGURE 1] The curves summarized in Figure 1 show two different patterns. The control curve shows the expected pattern in which a short Lag phase is followed by an exponential phase of growth (Lag phase) and then by a stationary phase of growth in which the maximum optical density (OD) observed was around 4. Shortly after 15 hours of incubation, the death phase starts. Curves from culture media containing 150 mM and 300 mM DES showed similar pattern and the final OD was close to 4.[FIGURE 1] The curves summarized in Figure 1 show two different patterns.

        <p>Regarding the cultures supplemented with 150 mM DES, two different curves can be distinguished in Figure 1: one was obtained from culture media inoculated with cells from the standard culture (LB with no DES), and the other was measured from cultures in which cells used as inoculum were previously grown at 150 mM DES (preadapted cells). The differences found were clear; the culture inoculated with preadapted cells reduced its adaptation time (Lag phase) by two hours and cell duplication rate was increased (the slope of exponential phase of growth goes from 0.464 to 0.504).Regarding the cultures supplemented with 150 mM DES, two different curves can be distinguished in Figure 1: one was obtained from culture media inoculated with cells from the standard culture (LB with no DES), and the other was measured from cultures in which cells used as inoculum were previously grown at 150 mM DES (preadapted cells).

        <p>Therefore, better results in terms of cellular growth were obtained with preadapted cells thus suggesting that E. coli can deal with DES at least at concentrations between 0 and 300 mM.

        <p>When the limit of 300 mM was exceeded, cellular adaptation started. At concentrations of 450 and 600 mM, the growth curves showed diauxic form and higher Lag phase. Diauxic curves have been previously reported from E. coli and many other bacteria (diphasic growth represented by two growth curves intervened by a short lag phase). These could be the result of: i) cellular growth usually using two different substrates at a different time (one of the substrates could be used preferentially and when it is exhausted, the second substrate is metabolised), or, ii) cellular growth affected by physicochemical parameters that can be changing during the incubation period. The maximum OD shown by the cultures with 450 mM DES was slightly higher (up to 4.5) than those reported from cultures with lower DES concentration. This profile could suggest that pre-adapted E. coli cells were able to grow nicely in the presence of 450 mM DES and may metabolise the DES or its derivatives when the DES is hydrolysed.When the limit of 300 mM was exceeded, cellular adaptation started.

        <p>In the case of 600 mM, the percentage of cellular inhibition exceeded 30%, the Lag phase of growth increased significantly, and the final OD is half of the OD density reached by the other cultures. These results suggested that concentrations around 600 mM were toxic for the cells thus negatively affecting cellular growth and metabolic activities.In the case of 600 mM, the percentage of cellular inhibition exceeded 30%, the Lag phase of growth increased significantly, and the final OD is half of the OD density reached by the other cultures.

        <p>[TABLE 2] The highest concentration tested in our experiments was 750 mM, at this concentration cell growth was not detected. Consequently, the DES concentrations above this value are toxic for E. coli. [FIGURE 2] The value of the Lag phase is closed in the three cultures (DES, AcChCl and MeCONH 2 ; between 25 and 28 hours) but is higher than the Lag phase observed in control cultures. Final maximum OD in MeCONH 2 -culture is higher than in control cultures. However, final OD in DES and AcChCl cultures (around 2.5) is lower than in control cultures. DES is more toxic than its constituent elements separately, based on the higher inhibition percentage and the lower duplication tax (Supplementary Table S2). pH decrease was observed in both AcChCl-cultures and MeCONH 2 -cultures with 6.5 vs 7.4 at the end of the stationary phase of growth respectively. This depletion was higher in the presence of AcChCl, which correlates to the lower cellular growth detected in these cultures compared to MeCONH 2 -cultures. Comparing the cellular rates from the DES, AcChCl and MeCONH 2 cultures, it can be concluded that the individual components are less toxic than the DES (mixture of two components in 1:2 ratio) as has been previously reported for most of DESs described up to now.[TABLE 2] The highest concentration tested in our experiments was 750 mM, at this concentration cell growth was not detected.

        <p>New advances on the knowledge of applied organic chemistry, biomedicine, pharmacy, nanotechnologies and materials sciences are contributing to the improvement of several industrial/technical processes at global scale. However, there is a concern about the importance of assessing risks of environmental pollutants obtained in those processes (Nilsen et al., 2019;Vita et al., 2018). Thus, several recent works address new guidelines and approaches to optimize the assessment of the quite recently environmental risks in both, terrestrial and aquatic environments (Song et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2019;Shiyuan et al. 2019). This work contributes to the knowledge of assessing risks of environmental pollutants, as it is the case of DESs as potential environmental contaminants. The search of literature focused on DESs using PubMed or Scopus as search engines revealed that around 800 papers have been published during the last 15 years (date of access 18 July 2019). The first studies were reported at the beginning of this century, but 90% of them have been mainly published during the last 5 years. Considering the recent high impact of these kind of solvents, it is worthy to highlight that only around 50 of these studies, analyse or discuss about potential toxicity on DESs (PubMed; "Deep eutectic solvents" AND "toxicity" as keywords). The study of DES toxicity is a quite new topic for research. Thus, the first approach for testing toxicity of choline chloride (ChCl) based DESs used two Gram positive bacteriaNew advances on the knowledge of applied organic chemistry, biomedicine, pharmacy, nanotechnologies and materials sciences are contributing to the improvement of several industrial/technical processes at global scale. However, there is a concern about the importance of assessing risks of environmental pollutants obtained in those processes (Nilsen et al., 2019;Vita et al., 2018). Thus, several recent works address new guidelines and approaches to optimize the assessment of the quite recently environmental risks in both, terrestrial and aquatic environments (Song et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2019;Shiyuan et al. 2019). This work contributes to the knowledge of assessing risks of environmental pollutants, as it is the case of DESs as potential environmental contaminants. The search of literature focused on DESs using PubMed or Scopus as search engines revealed that around 800 papers have been published during the last 15 years (date of access 18 July 2019). The first studies were reported at the beginning of this century, but 90% of them have been mainly published during the last 5 years.

Shortly after this study, some others stated that DESs toxicological effects are different based on their components, and usually, the cytotoxicity of tested DESs was much higher than that of their individual components (Hayyan et al., 2013b).Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

        <p>More recent studies have tested the toxicity of choline chloride-based DESs, with glucose, glycerol and oxalic acid as hydrogen bond donors, using fish and human cell lines, phytotoxicity using wheat and biodegradability using wastewater microorganisms through closed bottle test (Radošević et al., 2015). The cytotoxic potential of ammonium-based DESs with four hydrogen bond donors has also been studied using a variety of cell lines in vitro and animal model in vivo (Hayyan et al., 2015;Chen et al., 2017;Macário et al., 2019). Other organisms chosen as model organisms for testing DESs toxicity have been the following: Allium sativum (plant) and hydra (invertebrate) (Wen et al., 2015), several eukaryotic microorganisms like Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Aspergillus niger, Lentinus tigrinus and Candida cylindracea (Juneidi et al., 2016) and fish cell lines (Radošević et al., 2016) Although the examined DESs showed in general less cytotoxicity compared with ionic liquids (Kudłak et al., 2015), not all DESs can be considered readily biodegradable or environmentally friendly (Wen et al., 2015). Besides, most of the test used up to now to monitor DESs toxicity, are based on antibiograms and cells are not usually preadapted. Considering that DESs are normally highly dense and viscous solvents, the approaches already used in most of the cases do not guarantee accurate assays in which DESs could diffuse and interact efficiently with the cells or microbes.More recent studies have tested the toxicity of choline chloride-based DESs, with glucose, glycerol and oxalic acid as hydrogen bond donors, using fish and human cell lines, phytotoxicity using wheat and biodegradability using wastewater microorganisms through closed bottle test (Radošević et al., 2015).

        <p>Consequently, more investigation on this matter are required in order to provide specific and optimised protocols for testing DESs toxicity thus avoiding misunderstanding or wrong conclusions about potential negative effects of DESs.

A deep analysis of all studies reported up to now about the toxicity and biodegradability of DESs reveals that:</p>
        <p>-A large proportion of DESs are considered as "biodegradable" because most the components forming DESs are natural products. However, in most of the reports, accurate experiments to test biodegradability have not been conducted.-A large proportion of DESs are considered as "biodegradable" because most the components forming DESs are natural products.

        <p>-The terms biodegradation, assimilation, toxicity, tolerance and recycling are usually used in a confusing way in several studies based on DESs. Biodegradation involves degradation, transformation or accumulation of DESs or its derivatives within the cells. Assimilation involves the use of DESs as a source of nutrients for the growth of cells. Tolerance implies an increase of the biomass in a specific range of concentrations, but above the maximum concentration, cell growth and its metabolism become inhibited.-The terms biodegradation, assimilation, toxicity, tolerance and recycling are usually used in a confusing way in several studies based on DESs.

        <p>-In many of the experiments done with microbial cells to test the toxicity of DESs, parameters like rate of growth, time of incubation, OD at stationary phase of growth, pH of the media in unbuffered and buffered media are not continuously monitored. This is also true of some studies previously done using bacteria as model organism (Wen et al., 2015). As reported here, the addition of DES to the culture media promotes pH decrease. In addition to this, the process to sterilise the culture media or DES stock is also directly connected to pH decrease. This phenomenon was also previously described in the literature (Dai et al., 2014). In our study, pH depletion due to DES hydrolysis or spontaneous reactions involving MeCONH 2 , more significantly affects cellular proliferation and metabolic rates, than the DES or its singular components themselves.-In many of the experiments done with microbial cells to test the toxicity of DESs, parameters like rate of growth, time of incubation, OD at stationary phase of growth, pH of the media in unbuffered and buffered media are not continuously monitored.

        <p>-Toxicity can be measured by different approaches. In most of the reported works, toxicity is checked by using solid culture media in plates with disks in which DES is embedded (antibiogram-like test) (Zhao et al., 2015). This approach has an important limitation due to the high density and viscosity characterising most of the DESs described so far (Xu et al., 2017). These two properties restrict DESs diffusion from the disk to its surroundings, thus giving results that may not reflect real interaction between DESs and cells. Analysis of toxicity in liquid media minimizes this negative impact, especially in those cases in which DESs are particularly dense or show high viscosity.-Toxicity can be measured by different approaches.

        <p>-Biodegradability of DES (aerobic biodegradability) is usually evaluated using a closed bottle test, in which DESs are added to aerobic aqueous media inoculated with wastewater microorganisms, and the depletion of dissolved O 2 is periodically determined (Coleman et al., 2010). The biodegradation test is normally considered as valid if a 60% ThOD is achieved within 14 d for reference compound, and chemicals are deemed to be readily biodegradable if they can reach a biodegradation level higher than 60% within a 28-d period (OECD, 1992). However, most of the microbial strains used in previous studies are microaerobic, anaerobic or can switch their metabolism from highly oxic conditions to highly anoxic conditions. These aspects usually are not considered in the test of biodegradability done with DESs reported so far.-Biodegradability of DES (aerobic biodegradability) is usually evaluated using a closed bottle test, in which DESs are added to aerobic aqueous media inoculated with wastewater microorganisms, and the depletion of dissolved O 2 is periodically determined (Coleman et al., 2010).

        <p>-Crossed reactions between DESs and the salts/nutrients of the culture media have not been considered in the toxicity studies. Hydrolysation of DESs could occur in liquid culture media thus promoting crossing reactions between the products of the DES hydrolysations and the salts, amino acids, carbohydrates, etc. within the culture media. Besides, recent studies demonstrate that the DES water content, as well as the formation of water shell layers are important in order to keep stable their nanostructure (Hammond et al., 2017;Ma et al., 2018;Kumari et al., 2018).-Crossed reactions between DESs and the salts/nutrients of the culture media have not been considered in the toxicity studies.

        <p>-None of the studies reported up to now have considered testing the preadaptation of cells to the DESs. Because of this, there is a loss of information in terms of real capability of the cells to tolerate or even assimilate DESs. This study has demonstrated that under single assays in the presence of 600 mM DES the DES described here is toxic for the cells. However, when they were pre-adapted to this concentration, growth could be monitored. Consequently, we suggest including this parameter (cellular pre-adaptation) in further studies, in order to described more accurately the extent to which DESs are toxic to microbes.-None of the studies reported up to now have considered testing the preadaptation of cells to the DESs.

        <p>The new DES here tested is not toxic for E. coli, and maybe for other similar species, at concentrations between 0 and 300 mM. The DES used in this range of concentrations could be labelled as "environmentally friendly". At concentrations between 300 mM and 450 mM, cells can tolerate the DES, even though cellular growth and metabolic activities are slightly affected by it (typical microbial growth curves change to diauxic -diphasic-or triauxic -triphasic-curves and Lag times are higher than those observe at lower DES concentrations). Above 600 mM, the DES is toxic causing complete inhibition of growth. This toxicity is not only due to the chemical composition of the DES, but also due to the high acidification of the media caused by DES hydrolysis. Thus, concentrations above 600 mM could allow its use as bactericide or even to explore potential inhibitory effect on tumoral cells. The assays described here have demonstrated that the type of culture used to test toxicity, preadaptation of the cells used as a model to check cytotoxicity or the methods used to sterilise DESs can significantly affect the results when evaluating the degree of toxicity of DESs. 0 before autoclave 7.0 7.0 6.9 6.9 6.9 6.9 6.9 7 .0 0 after autoclave and Absorbance (600 nm) Figure 1: E. coli growth curves.
