        <p>The accessibility of renewable materials that are both sustainable and competitive is essential to accommodate the rapid growth in consumption of 3D printing materials. We have developed biobased photopolymer resins based on modified soybean oil for application in commercial stereolithography printers. First, soybean oil methacrylates with various functionalities were successfully synthesized from epoxidized soybean oil as an alternative to commercially available soybean oil acrylate. A library of photoresins was created by mixing up to 80% of the biobased (meth)acrylate oligomers with biobased diluents and a photoinitiator. The resin composition was optimized to achieve a maximum biobased content and a low viscosity. The manufactured parts demonstrated complete layer fusion and accurate print quality. Stiffness and toughness can be tuned by altering the chemical composition or the number of functional groups per oligomer. These biobased materials can be employed to reduce the environmental impact of additive manufacturing while being competitive with current fossil-based resins from commercial manufacturers.The accessibility of renewable materials that are both sustainable and competitive is essential to accommodate the rapid growth in consumption of 3D printing materials.

        <p>Additive manufacturing (AM) allows the production of customized parts from a wide range of materials, such as metals, ceramics, thermoplastics polymers, and photopolymer resins. Considering the versatility of AM, it is often promoted as a new industrial revolution. 1,2 The global market for AM materials is expected to grow by over $20 billion by the end of 2029, 3 of which 22% will be shared by thermosetting photopolymers. Currently, photopolymer resins claim almost half of the market, which is due to their mechanical, chemical, and thermal stability as well as their excellent compatibility with stereolithographic 3D printing. 4 Commercial resins, however, consist of fossil-based photopolymers that are expensive and limited. Therefore, the availability of renewable alternatives is required to facilitate the increasing demand for AM materials, while reducing their environmental impact. 5,6 Lithography-based printing enables layer-by-layer curing of liquid photopolymer resins into products with precisely controlled architectures. 7 This technology includes both digital light processing (DLP) and laser-based stereolithography (SLA). 8,9 In comparison to fused filament fabrication (FFF), based on the extrusion of thermoplastic monofilaments, lithography-based printing is superior in terms of accuracy, surface finishing, and resolution. 10 SLA and DLP are applied in product prototyping and modeling as well as medical device fabrication, such as dental implants 11,12 and patient-specific scaffolds for tissue regeneration. 13,14 Resins for stereolithographic 3D printing require the presence of functional groups to ensure network formation, and the choice of material is therefore limited. Photocurable (meth)acrylate systems undergo radical chain-growth polymerization during 3D printing and consist of an initiator, monomers and oligomers (sometimes referred to as macromonomers). 15 Additives such as stabilizers, fillers or optical absorbers can be added to improve printability or resin properties. The mechanical behavior of thermosetting polymers strongly relates to the molecular architecture of their cross-linked network, which can be influenced by monomer-to-oligomer ratio and number of functional groups. 16 In general, acrylate systems are known for their rapid curing. This results in highly cross-linked and inhomogeneous polymer networks, which tend to be brittle and show low toughness. Methacrylates are less reactive than acrylates, and their incorporation into photocurable resins can enhance stiffness and tensile strength. 17,18 In recent years, a limited number of academic studies reported the formulation and application of print resins basedAdditive manufacturing (AM) allows the production of customized parts from a wide range of materials, such as metals, ceramics, thermoplastics polymers, and photopolymer resins.

        <p>The reaction of ESO with methacrylic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio results in the full conversion of epoxides, indicated by the disappearance of the signal at 2.8-3.2 ppm corresponding to the epoxide groups (Figure 1a andc). The functionality of ESOMA 3 was calculated from the integral of the methacrylate signals (5.5-6.1 ppm) with respect to the integral representing the CH 3 chain-end (0.8-0.9 ppm), 34 giving a methacrylate functionality of 3.0 (Table 1). A detailed structural characterization of ESOMA 3 is presented in Figure S3. Small traces of unreacted methacrylic acid are present (5.6 and 6.2 ppm), since the reaction product was used without further purification. For comparison, ESOMA 3 was also synthesized with excess methacrylic acid, followed by washing with an aqueous KOH solution to remove unreacted monomers. As a result, no residual methacrylic acid was observed in the spectrum (Figure S4), and the methacrylate functionality is determined to be equal. No significant difference was observed in the elastic modulus of the cured products with or without the small monomer traces, despite their anticipated incorporation in the polymer network. Hence, we decided to proceed with methacrylation in an equimolar ratio, thereby circumventing repetitive washing steps and thus preventing the extensive use of chemicals (KOH, water, or ethyl acetate), which is beneficial for the environment and cost reduction in view of potential commercialization.The reaction of ESO with methacrylic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio results in the full conversion of epoxides, indicated by the disappearance of the signal at 2.8-3.2 ppm corresponding to the epoxide groups (Figure 1a andc).

In general, a viscosity below 2 Pa•s is desired to allow appropriate recoating of the resin during stereolithographic 3D printing. 35,36 For instance, commercial manufactures, such as Autodesk and Formlabs, use viscosities of 0.44 and 1.6 Pa• s for their fossil-based standard clear resins. 31 Table 2 displays the bioresin viscosities at a high shear rate of 50 s -1 , typical for the printing process. 37 As anticipated, the viscosity decreases with an increasing amount of diluent, which is revealed in the series: BMPR-01 → BMPR-03, BMPR-04 → BMPR-06, and BMPR-07 → BMPR-09 (Figure S5). The incorporation of acrylate oligomer leads to a higher resin viscosity compared to the use of methacrylate oligomers due to the addition of more viscous ESOA 3 with respect to ESOMA 2 and ESOMA 3 (Table 1).The printability of a resin is largely affected by its viscosity.

        <p>All formulated photoresins were cured in tensile bar molds and subsequently subjected to a stress-strain analysis to determine the E modulus (E cast ). Increasing the relative amount of monofunctional diluent results in products with a significantly higher modulus (Table 2), related to the more dense polymer network that is formed while curing. The formulations including IBOMA instead of THFMA give rise to a higher stiffness as well, due to the more rigid structure of IBOMA.All formulated photoresins were cured in tensile bar molds and subsequently subjected to a stress-strain analysis to determine the E modulus (E cast ).

        <p>BMPR-06, BMPR-09, and BMPR-10 were selected for application in stereolithographic 3D printing. BMPR-06 and BMPR-09, based on ESOA 3 and ESOMA 3 oligomers, respectively, show a low viscosity (&lt;2.0 Pa•s) in combination with the promise of a high E modulus. ESOMA 2 -containing BMPR-10 is taken into account to determine the effect of methacrylate functionality on the mechanical performance.BMPR-06, BMPR-09, and BMPR-10 were selected for application in stereolithographic 3D printing.

        <p>Stereolithographic 3D Printing. The required exposure time for the print job was determined from the working curves of the selected bioresins (Figure S1), as described in the Materials and Methods section. BMPR-06, BMPR-09, and BMPR-10 were successfully applied in the DLP 3D printing process. The network formation of biobased methacrylate resins was confirmed by FTIR analysis of BMPR-10 (Figure 2). Double bonds in IBOMA and ESOMA 2 are converted during 3D printing, as indicated by the significant decrease of the signal representing the CC stretch vibration (1635 cm -1 ) and the shift of the C-O-C oscillation (1165 to 1150 cm -1 ).Stereolithographic 3D Printing.

        <p>Rook tower prototypes with a complex architecture were printed, and their visual evaluation demonstrates good print quality with smooth surface finishing (Figure 3a-c). The rook towers from BMPR-09 and BMPR-10 have a more intense color related to the amber-colored ESOMA. The university logo (Figure 3d) shows that high edge definition is achieved with the designed process. The SEM image (Figure 3e) of the internal double helix within the prototype reveals a complete fusion between the layers of 100 μm, which emphasizes the compatibility of our renewable resins with DLP technology up to the print-layer level. The vertical edges of the helices are slightly serrated, caused by the top surface of a layer receiving a larger UV dose in comparison to the back surface. 38 Product Performance. The glass transition temperature of the printed objects, derived from the peak maximum of the damping factor (Figure 4), is depicted in Table 3. Products from BMPR-09 exhibit the highest glass transition at 97 °C. Subsequently, the cross-link density was calculated from the storage modulus in the rubbery region. BMPR-09 gives rise to a higher cross-link density than BMPR-10 (Table 3). This is related to the presence of ESOMA 3 within BMPR-09 with respect to ESOMA 2 in BMPR-10. A higher methacrylate functionality leads to a denser polymer network and hence a higher v e 39 Figure 5 visualizes the tensile properties of the printed objects by showing the representative stress-strain curves. The repeatability of the 3D printing method was investigated by preparing, printing, and tensile testing two batches of identical composition for all bioresins. This results in the same trend in the tensile properties (Figure 5), and no significant difference in the E modulus was observed between the different batches of equal resin composition. Furthermore, the elastic moduli of the printed objects (Table 3), all tested normal to the print layers, were similar to those of the mold-cured products (Table 2), demonstrating the competitiveness of the stereolithographic printing process with respect to traditional casting techniques.Rook tower prototypes with a complex architecture were printed, and their visual evaluation demonstrates good print quality with smooth surface finishing (Figure 3a-c).

        <p>The deformation energy, defined as the area under a stress-strain curve, is related to the toughness. While stiffness and tensile strength of thermosets typically increase for higher cross-link densities, toughness decreases. 15 As a matter of fact, printed objects from BMPR-10 and BMPR-06 demonstrate a higher deformation energy in comparison to BMPR-09, while the cross-link density is lower (Table 3). In addition, BMPR-09 gives rise to the highest E modulus and tensile strength with values of 1.0 GPa and 44 MPa, respectively.The deformation energy, defined as the area under a stress-strain curve, is related to the toughness.

        <p>While both photoresins have an equal monomer-tooligomer ratio, BMPR-09 gives rise to a significantly higher elastic modulus than BMPR-06. In other words, the fully methacrylated system based on ESOMA 3 provides more stiffness. When comparing both methacrylate resins, BMPR-09 has a higher E modulus than BMPR-10, due to the higher cross-link density that results from the incorporation of methacrylate oligomer with higher functionality. Hence, the tensile properties can be tuned by changing the chemical composition (acrylate versus methacrylate) or the number of side groups in the oligomer.While both photoresins have an equal monomer-tooligomer ratio, BMPR-09 gives rise to a significantly higher elastic modulus than BMPR-06.

        <p>In general, the formulated biobased resins based on soybean oil demonstrate good mechanical performance. The ultimate properties such as stiffness and glass transition temperature are superior to pure ESOA resins and comparable to recently reported values for alternative soybean oil-based epoxy acrylate resins cured by conventional methods. 28,29 In addition, the tensile properties of BMPR-09 are significantly higher than those of the commercial clear photoresin of Autodesk (PR48), as depicted in Figure S6. The clear resin of Liqcreate, Deep Blue (LCDB), demonstrates the highest E modulus and tensile strength, while the biobased resins have a higher elongation at break. Both PR48 and LCDB show a lower toughness (20 and 294 J•m -3 , respectively) in comparison to the bioresins (323-560 J•m -3 ). Hence, the mechanical performance of printed BMPRs is competitive with commercial counterparts.In general, the formulated biobased resins based on soybean oil demonstrate good mechanical performance.

        <p>Epoxidized soybean oil was methacrylated, leading to products with a functionality of 2.3 and 3.0. A library of photoresins was generated by mixing soybean oil (meth)acrylates with monofunctional diluents and a photoinitiator in various compositions. Resins with biorenewable carbon contents of 77 to 80% and viscosities of 0.5 to 1.5 Pa•s were selected for stereolithographic 3D printing. The manufactured prototypes demonstrate the compatibility of the biobased resins with DLP technology up to the microscopic level. The fully methacrylated resin based on soybean oil methacrylate enhances the stiffness and tensile strength with respect to the soybean oil acrylate. By lowering the methacrylate functionality, the elastic modulus decreases as a result of the lower cross-link density while toughness increases. The biobased resins provide both a sustainable and competitive alternative to facilitate the increasing demand for materials in additive manufacturing.Epoxidized soybean oil was methacrylated, leading to products with a functionality of 2.3 and 3.0.
