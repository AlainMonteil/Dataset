        <p>The metal-catalyzed carbene transfer reaction from a diazo compound (R 2 CN 2 ) to an organic molecule is a sustainable synthetic strategy. A vast number of substrates are reactive towards diazo reagents and new C-C bonds are formed by inserting a 'CR 2 ' moiety into the organic skeleton. Depending on the electronic and steric nature 1,2 of R 2 CN 2 (Fig. 1) as well as the engaged catalytic system, compounds containing C=C, C≡C, C=O, C-H and X-H (X = Si, Se, Ge, Sn, heteroatom) bonds can be chosen as target reaction substrates (Fig. 2). [3][4][5][6] The mass conservation of the synthetic procedure is very high due to the formation of N 2 as the sole by-product. Even if the great chemical versatility of diazo compounds is recognized, 7 the employment of these carbene sources in a large scale has been limited due to their hazardous nature. However, it is worth noting that diazo compounds A-C types have been more used than D and E types due to their better stability (Fig. 1). This drawback has more recently been overcome by applying continuous-flow technologies for handling such very reactive reagents and allowing the safe applicability of carbene-based procedures, also on a large scale. 8 In addition, in order to further increase the sustainability of diazo-based processes, alternative reagents, producing the desired diazo molecule in situ, 9 have been employed with a consequent improvement of the safety of the experimental methodology.The metal-catalyzed carbene transfer reaction from a diazo compound (R 2 CN 2 ) to an organic molecule is a sustainable synthetic strategy.

        <p>The introduction of a cyclopropane unit into an organic skeleton confers specific chemo-physical features to the target molecule and, in many cases, peculiar pharmaceutical activities. [16][17][18][19][20] The high chemical reactivity of cyclopropanecontaining species is due to the high bond-strain of the threemembered ring; many other valuable compounds can be easily synthesized by inducing ring-opening reactions of the cyclopropyl fragment. [21][22][23][24][25][26] Frequently, the cleavage of the cyclopropyl carbon-carbon bond is also a way, in which active drug molecules produce their pharmacological effects. 16 The cyclopropanation reaction, which takes place by transferring the carbene unit from the diazo compound to the double bond, 27 can occur with a specific diastereoselectivity and, if conducted in the presence of a chiral promoter, a pair of enantiomers are obtained for each diastereomer (Scheme 1). The reaction selectivity can be modulated by using the opportune metal catalyst and, also in the case of ironpromoted reactions, the choice of the ligand that coordinates the metal center is crucial for enhancing both the chemo-and stereoselectivity (diastereo-and enantioselectivity) of the process. 28 In order to maximize the reaction chemoselectivity, it is crucial to avoid the dimerization of carbene fragments (:CR) deriving from the diazo decomposition.The introduction of a cyclopropane unit into an organic skeleton confers specific chemo-physical features to the target molecule and, in many cases, peculiar pharmaceutical activities.

        <p>Among all the active metal porphyrin cyclopropanation catalysts, iron derivatives have emerged as a very active class of promoters, ever since T. Kodadek, L. K. Woo and co-authors published the first report on the catalytic activity of iron(II) porphyrins in 1995. 32 The increasing interest in developing iron porphyrin-based catalytic cyclopropanations is also due to the activity of heme-containing enzymes in cyclopropane biosynthesis (not involving direct carbene transfer reactions), 33,34 which makes synthetic iron porphyrins an interesting class of bio-inspired catalysts. It is important to point out that, while the direct alkene cyclopropanation is not promoted by natural enzymes, the reaction is now efficiently mediated by engineered enzymes, whose employment allows us to take advantage of the benefits of using natural systems for non-natural organic transformations (see below).Among all the active metal porphyrin cyclopropanation catalysts, iron derivatives have emerged as a very active class of promoters, ever since T.

        <p>When the cyclopropanation reaction is promoted by an achiral iron porphyrin catalyst, the diastereomeric ratio is determined by the three-dimensional arrangement of the porphyrin structure, which usually favors the formation of the more thermodynamic stable transisomer. The reaction diastereoselectivity can be efficiently modulated thanks to the numerous structural modifications, which can be executed by functionalizing both -pyrrolic and meso positions of the porphyrin skeleton, as well as inserting opportune axial ligands (L) onto the iron metal center (Fig. 3).When the cyclopropanation reaction is promoted by an achiral iron porphyrin catalyst, the diastereomeric ratio is determined by the three-dimensional arrangement of the porphyrin structure, which usually favors the formation of the more thermodynamic stable transisomer.

        <p>It is generally assumed that the first step of cyclopropanations mediated by an iron porphyrin is its reaction with the diazo reagent yielding an iron-carbene intermediate, which is able to transfer the carbene moiety to the incoming alkene. The usually observed trans-diastereoselectivity is due to the favorable formation of transition state A, in which the steric interaction between the large R L group on the alkene and the R substituent on the carbene unit is minimized (Scheme 2). Considering that the formation of a terminal and electrophilic carbene is generally assumed, the best catalytic performances are usually obtained by reacting electron-rich alkenes, which show a reduced steric hindrance around the double bond. Thus, the cyclopropanation of sterically encumbered (such as internal alkenes) and electron-deficient alkenes is still considered a challenging reaction both for electronic reasons and for the alkene difficulty of approaching the iron-carbene functionality.It is generally assumed that the first step of cyclopropanations mediated by an iron porphyrin is its reaction with the diazo reagent yielding an iron-carbene intermediate, which is able to transfer the carbene moiety to the incoming alkene.

        <p>The first studies on the activity of iron porphyrin catalysts reported the employment of iron(II) derivatives and then, in view of the better chemical stability of iron(III) equivalent compounds, the latter class of porphyrin complexes have emerged as more useful and easier to handle cyclopropanation promoters. 32 It is supposed that, independently of the oxidation state of the iron precursor, an iron(II) complex is formed in situ, thanks to the mild reducing capability of the diazo reagent, which plays the double role of carbene source and reductant. 29,32,35,36 This proposal was supported by the good catalytic activity that was achieved by using iron(III) derivatives in combination with reducing agents such as cobaltocene (CoCp 2 ).The first studies on the activity of iron porphyrin catalysts reported the employment of iron(II) derivatives and then, in view of the better chemical stability of iron(III) equivalent compounds, the latter class of porphyrin complexes have emerged as more useful and easier to handle cyclopropanation promoters. 32 It is supposed that, independently of the oxidation state of the iron precursor, an iron(II) complex is formed in situ, thanks to the mild reducing capability of the diazo reagent, which plays the double role of carbene source and reductant. 29,32,35,36 This proposal was supported by the good catalytic activity that was achieved by using iron(III) derivatives in combination with reducing agents such as cobaltocene (CoCp 2 ).</p>
        <p>In some cases the addition of CoCp 2 was essential to achieve the alkene cyclopropanation, as when the biologically active Nand O-protected 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) was used as the diazo derivative (Scheme 3). 38 It was presumed that the employed diazo reagent was not effective in reducing the ferric state of Fe(TPP)Cl (1) (TPP = dianion of tetraphenyl porphyrin) into the ferrous state and consequently, the cyclopropanation did not occur in the absence of CoCp 2 .In some cases the addition of CoCp 2 was essential to achieve the alkene cyclopropanation, as when the biologically active Nand O-protected 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) was used as the diazo derivative (Scheme 3). 38 It was presumed that the employed diazo reagent was not effective in reducing the ferric state of Fe(TPP)Cl (1) (TPP = dianion of tetraphenyl porphyrin) into the ferrous state and consequently, the cyclopropanation did not occur in the absence of CoCp 2 .</p>
        <p>The porphyrin skeleton of iron(III) derivatives have been largely modified in order to tune the chemo-physical characteristics of the catalyst. For example, the functionalization of the porphyrin core with carbohydrate units enhanced the reaction transdiasteroselectivity, with respect to the unsubstituted porphyrin ligand, and the catalyst solubility in organic solvents. 39 Even if chiral carbohydrate units were present, the reaction was not enantioselective, due to the distance of the catalytically active metal center from the chiral portion of the molecule. The authors envisaged a potential use of glycoporphyrins, to promote cyclopropanation reactions in biphasic media by taking advantage of their amphiphilic nature. 39 As depicted in Scheme 4, the tridimensional arrangement of iron porphyrin 4 was the most effective for inducing very good trans-diastero discriminations. Even if catalyst 6 was less efficient in terms of diastereoselectivity, it was chosen to study the scope of the reaction between ethyl diazoacetate (EDA) and eight differently substituted styrenes, in view of the facility of synthesizing it with respect to catalyst 4. The catalytic 6/EDA/alkene molar ratio of 1:1100:5000 was employed.The porphyrin skeleton of iron(III) derivatives have been largely modified in order to tune the chemo-physical characteristics of the catalyst.

        <p>As already stated, a reduced catalytic performance is usually observed when electron-deficient alkenes are the chosen reagents. To overcome this limitation, an umpolung approach was developed in which the electron density of alkenes was increased by inserting a phosphorus ylide moiety in the -position with respect to the double bond. 40 Initial attempts in reacting allylic phosphorus ylide compounds with methyl diazoacetate, (CO 2 Me)CHN 2 (MDA), in the presence of Fe(TCP)Cl (7) (TCP = dianion of tetra(4-chlorophenyl) porphyrin) did not afford corresponding cyclopropane. However, when 4-chloro benzaldehyde (PCBA) was added to the reaction mixture to trap the final organic product, the insertion of the carbene moiety in the alkene C-H bond was observed. 41,42 Mechanistic studies revealed that the iron porphyrin catalyst 7 forms an active iron-carbene catalyst whose reaction with ylide 8 yields a very reactive cyclopropylmethyl ylide intermediate, which is involved in a ring-opening reaction as soon as it is formed. The proposed mechanism was further supported by the isolation of vinyl cyclopropane 9 in a low amount (6% yield) alongside the product 10 deriving from the ring-opening reaction of the cyclopropyl ring (Scheme 5).As already stated, a reduced catalytic performance is usually observed when electron-deficient alkenes are the chosen reagents.

        <p>Thus, in order to synthesize vinyl cyclopropanes, it was imperative to suppress the ring-opening reaction of cyclopropylmethyl ylide intermediate 11 by maintaining a very low concentration of 11 in the reaction medium. To reach this goal, the synthesis was performed by using a phosphonium salt which, in the presence of the iron carbene and a base, was transformed into the cyclopropylmethyl ylide derivative. The in situ formed ylide was immediately trapped by the aldehyde PCBA before being involved in the ring-opening reaction described in Scheme 6. This synthetic strategy was applied for the synthesis of vinylcyclopropanes 13a-13n starting from crotonate-derived phosphonium salt 12, tert-butyl diazoacetate ( t BDA) and differently substituted aldehydes, in the presence of the catalyst Fe(TCP)Cl ( 7) and K 2 CO 3 as the base (Scheme 7). The formation of iron-carbene porphyrins, as active intermediates in the cyclopropanation of alkenes by diazo derivatives, is well recognized when halodiazo compounds, aryldiazomethane or alkyl diazo esters are employed as the carbene sources. 43 On the other hand, the formation of iron-dialkylcarbene intermediate has only been proposed due to the high chemical instability of donor-donor dialkyldiazomethanes, which prevents experimental mechanistic studies. As discussed in the successive section, instable diazo compounds are usually formed in situ starting from more stable diazo-precursors. Recently, iron-dialkylcarbene compounds were synthesized by C. M. Che and co-authors by following a different procedure. Complexes Fe(TPFPP)Ad ( 14) (TPFPP = dianion of tetra(pentafluorophenyl porphyrin, Ad = 2-adamantylidene) and Fe(TTP)(Ad) (15) (TTP = dianion of tetratolyl porphyrin) were synthesized by treating iron(II) porphyrins with aziadamantane under UV irradiation (365 nm) at room temperature (Scheme 8). 44 It should be noted that although carbene complexes 14 and 15 can be also obtained from commercially available iron(III) porphyrin chloride, isolated yields were lower than those attained by using iron(II) derivatives as starting materials. It was suggested that the free Ad was able to reduce the iron(III) into an iron(II) center, which is the active species reacting with the diazo reagent. It is worth noting that the formation of low-valent Fe(II)-carbene complexes with a neutral coordinated carbene ligand was proposed on the basis of the study of the electronic structures of 14 and 15 complexes. Iron complexes 14 and 15 displayed a significant thermal and chemical stability and complex 14 resulted in being an efficient catalyst for the cylopropanation of styrenes with donor-acceptor and donor-donor diazo reagents, such as (Ph)(CF 3 )CN In order to overcome this drawback, the cationic iron(III) meso-tetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin pentachloride complex 17 was associated with the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) in amounts above the critical micelle concentration (CMC). The so-formed micelles were hydrophilic on the exterior and showed an apolar interior space where organic compounds can be concentrated to react in an acceptable rate. 45 The resulting water-soluble micellar catalyst, constituted by 1.0 mol% 17 and 20 mM SDS, was employed for the cyclopropanation of differently substituted alkenes with EDA; yields from moderate to very good were achieved (Scheme 9). Note that, in order to avoid the formation of sideproducts deriving from the carbene dimerization, the diazo compound was added in small consecutive portions to the reaction mixture. Alongside the water medium, biphasic systems (H 2 O/organic solvent) were also applied for cyclopropanations by using chemically stable diazo-precursors, which are safely transformed into the desired diazo species in situ.Thus, in order to synthesize vinyl cyclopropanes, it was imperative to suppress the ring-opening reaction of cyclopropylmethyl ylide intermediate 11 by maintaining a very low concentration of 11 in the reaction medium.

        <p>Many papers have been published on the use of stable diazoprecursors 14,27 since V. K.

Besides all the diazo-precursors employed, Diazald is one of the most interesting reagents because it is able to generate the simplest diazo compound: diazomethane (CH 2 N 2 ). The very low carbon content of CH 2 N 2 renders this species extremely reactive and very difficult to handle. Some years ago, B. Morandi and E. M. Carreira reported on the transformation of a water soluble derivative of Diazald into diazomethane when treated in strong basic aqueous conditions (6.0 mol/L KOH). 49 The reaction was conducted in a biphasic system to permit the migration of the so-formed CH 2 N 2 from the aqueous to the organic phase, where the iron-catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes took place.

        <p>The above described procedure to generate diazomethane in situ was tested in cyclopropanations mediated by catalytic dendrimers. These macromolecular catalysts were synthesized by applying a convergent approach 51 and show the porphyrin molecule anchored to dendrons by ethereal bonds. 52 The analysis of the catalytic activity of Fe(TPP)Cl-based dendrimers species of different generations, disclosed that the cyclopropanation of 4-chloro--methylstyrene by CH 2 N 2 occurred to a similar extent to that promoted by the corresponding 'free' iron porphyrin catalyst. Achieved data could open the door to a more general use of dendrimercontaining catalysts with the beneficial outputs of their easy recovery by precipitation, nano-, or ultrafiltration. Diazomethane can be also generated from the decomposition of temozolomide (TMZ), an imidazotetrazine derivative which is normally used as an anti-tumour agent in therapy. TMZ is a commercially available and safe compound that was very recently employed by P. Hergenrother and R. L.

On the other hand, these chemo-physical characteristics can be modulated by introducing lipophilic substituents onto the ligand scaffold and coordinating axial ligands to the active metal, and thus exploited for facilitating the recovery and recycling of these chemically stable catalytic species. (Fig. 4). The use of Fe(II)(Pc) (52), (Pc= unsubstituted phthalocyanine with R=H in Fig. 4) ligand, as a cyclopropanation catalyst was reported for the first time by B. Sains and co-authors. The cyclopropanation of 4-methylstyrene by EDA, yielding 3g, occurred in the moderate yield of 55% indicating a modest catalytic activity of complex 52. 64 The catalytic efficiency dropped by replacing the acceptor-only EDA diazo species with the donor-acceptor methyl phenyl diazoacetate, (CO 2 Me)(Ph)CN 2 , as the carbene source. In this latter case, the reaction between methyl phenyl diazoacetate and styrene, in the presence of catalyst 52, yielded the corresponding cyclopropane in very low yield of 8% and with a low diastereoselectivity. 65 Better results were obtained in the Fe(II)(Pc) (52)-catalyzed reaction of 4-methylstyrene with trimethylsilyldiazomethane ((Me 3 Si)CHN 2 ). In this case, the trans-C-silyl cyclopropane 53 was obtained in the acceptable yield of 65% (Scheme 19). 66 It should be noted that the reaction was conducted under heterogeneous conditions (complex 52 is completely insoluble in 1,2-dichloroethane), which permitted to easily recover the catalyst by a simple filtration. The catalytic efficiency of the recovered complex was maintained to allow its recycle for several catalytic cycles. 66 In order to enhance the catalytic activity of iron phthalocyanine complexes, different ligands were used to synthesize a small class of catalysts. The so-obtained 54 and 55 iron(II) complexes as well as 56-58 iron(III) derivatives were employed to promote the synthesis of cyclopropane 3d through the reaction of styrene with EDA (Scheme 20). Although the iron(III) catalyst 57, showing EWGs on the phthalocyanine skeleton, quantitatively promoted the formation of 3d, the achieved trans-diastereoselectivity was low (trans/cis = 2). Similar results were obtained by using either iron(II) or iron(III) phthalocyanine catalysts indicating that both classes of complexes are probably transformed in the same catalytically active intermediate in situ.

        <p>Because carbene dimerization side-reactions were not efficiently promoted by Fe(III)(79)OMe, the use of an alkene stoichiometric excess was not required, with the consequent benefit of reducing costs. As described in Scheme 27, the reaction worked well when terminal alkenes and low sterically hindered diazo compounds were employed. This suggested that the active iron metal center was embedded into a crowded tridimensional porphyrin framework, which selects the size of approaching reagents. Considering that many reactions were performed to optimize experimental conditions, only the best results, in terms of trans-diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, are listed in Scheme 27. Many reactions were promoted by the low catalytic loading of 0.01 mol% and occurred in a very short reaction time, achieving significant TON and TOF values (TON up to 10,000 and TOF (turnover frequency) up to 120,000 h -1 ). 80 The same catalytic reactions were repeated in the presence of the iron(III) methoxy complex of the porphyrin 87, which is the achiral precursor of 79. The reactions occurred with similar diastereoselectivities indicating that, independently from the nature of the chiral portion of the molecule, the reaction diastereocontrol is mainly due to the tridimensional arrangement of the porphyrin backbone. In view of the achieved results, the final chiral binaphthyl units of 79 were replaced by other chiral 'hats', by reacting 87 with (L)-alanine tert-butyl ester, (S)--methylbenzylamine, and (L) phenylalanine methyl ester obtaining the corresponding strap-porphyrins 88-90 (Scheme 28).

        <p>The strategy to install a synthetic catalyst into a natural scaffold was investigated by Hayashi and co-authors, 112 who compared the catalytic activity of natural heme in native myoglobin (nMb) to that of myoglobin reconstituted (rMb), which was obtained by inserting iron porphycene (FePc) (Fig. 8) in the biological frame. The obtained rMb, in the presence of sodium dithionite (Na 2 S 2 O 4 ) as the reductant species, efficiently promoted the styrene cyclopropanation by EDA forming 3d in 99% yield, with a complete trans-diastereoselectivity and with a TOF value 35 times higher than that of the native myoglobin (nMb). The different kinetics of the cyclopropanation promoted by the natural and non-natural iron catalysts was rationalized by the analysis of the Michaelis-Menten parameters, which were determined at various styrene and EDA concentrations. The superior catalytic efficiency of rMb was ascribed to the different reactivity of the two catalysts with respect to the diazo reagent. In particular, the reaction of rMb with EDA was investigated by DFT calculations and by using the stopped flow technique. The latter allowed to spectroscopically detect the formation of a new species upon addition of EDA to the starting ferrous rMb catalyst. The new species was supposed to be the iron carbene intermediate and the DFT study revealed that the carbene formation was favored by the presence of porphycene. The strong ligand field of porphycene stabilized the triplet state of the iron(II) rMb species and reduced the number of intersystem crossing steps, which are necessary to form the active iron carbene intermediate. In addition, the smaller energy barrier observed for rMb with respect to that of the native myoglobin nMb to reach the singlet carbene species may explains the outstanding TOF values achieved in rMb-catalyzed styrene cyclopropanations. Using the so-called orthogonal enzyme/cofactor pair strategy, 113 which combines the heme substitution with aminoacidic mutations in order to maximize the affinity of the protein heme-binding pocket towards the non-natural cofactor, E. Brustad and co-authors replaced heme with the iron deuteroporphyrin IX (Fe-DPIX) in a model bacterial cytochrome P450 (P450 BM3 ). 114 Binding studies and structural investigations identified the WIVS-FM variant as the most selective scaffold for embedding Fe-DPIX due to the presence of two mutations (L272W and G265F). These two mutations were able to fill the cavities generated in the binding pocket by the lack of vinyl groups onto the deuteroporphyrin ligand (Fig. 9). The two mutations, together with the cofactor replacement, induced conformational rearrangements in the protein scaffold which were responsible for unusual reactivities. In fact, the obtained artificial metalloenzyme showed the loss of the monooxygenase activity and this feature encouraged the authors to test the metalloenzyme as a catalyst of cyclopropanation reactions under aerobic conditions, which are generally prohibitive for P450-mediated carbene transfer reactions.The strategy to install a synthetic catalyst into a natural scaffold was investigated by Hayashi and co-authors, 112 who compared the catalytic activity of natural heme in native myoglobin (nMb) to that of myoglobin reconstituted (rMb), which was obtained by inserting iron porphycene (FePc) (Fig. 8) in the biological frame.

The cofactor replacement, together with the axial ligand mutation, didn't modify the protein structure but was responsible for its increasing redox potential. The carbene transferase activity of the artificial Mb(H64V,V68A,H93NMH)[Fe(DADP)] was evaluated under different catalytic conditions in the model reaction between styrene and EDA (Scheme 33). 120 The obtained biocatalyst showed a high reactivity affording the product 3d in an excellent yield and selectivity both under anaerobic/reducing and anaerobic/non-reducing conditions (&gt;99% yield, 99% de, 99% ee). A good catalytic activity was maintained under aerobic/reducing conditions (85% yield, 99% de, 98% ee). The study of the substrate scope displayed the ability of Mb(H64V,V68A,H93NMH)[Fe(DADP)] in efficiently promoting, under anaerobic/non-reducing conditions, the cyclopropanation of both electron-rich and electron-poor alkenes. Very good results were also attained by reacting more challenging substrates, such as acrylate esters and trifluoromethyl-, nitro-and pentafluoro styrenes (Scheme 33). 120 Hammett analyses and radical rearrangement/trapping experiments were undertook to explain the catalytic superiority of Mb(H64V,V68A,H93NMH)[Fe(DADP)] with respect to the heme/histidine-containing precursor. Based on the obtained data, the authors proposed a stepwise mechanism in which the formation of a radical-type iron-carbene intermediate was responsible for the expanded reaction scope (Scheme 34). In addition, the cofactor/axial ligand substitution was considered responsible for the high activity under non-reducing conditions. These structural modifications may increase the protein redox potential favoring the reduction -by EDA-of the starting Fe(III) species to the Fe(II) intermediate, which was then involved in the proposed radical mechanism. The above-mentioned ArMs were all obtained by using a heme protein as the biological scaffold for taking advantage of the presence of a well-defined cofactor binding site and a large hydrophobic binding pocket, which is appropriate for the accommodation of cyclopropanation substrates. An alternative strategy is the anchorage of either a heme group or an iron porphyrinoid onto a bio-scaffold, using the synthetic approaches illustrated in Scheme 30 (pathways c and d).

Roelfes and co-authors investigated the carbene transfer activity of the heme group assembled to different variants of the lactococcal multidrug resistance regulator (LmrR), 121 a homodimeric protein with a large and hydrophobic binding pocket at the dimer interface, which is well suitable for hosting the hydrophobic reaction components. Except in one case, all the other LmrR-based catalysts worked better than the free hemin cofactor although the heme group in these ArMs should have been inaccessible for the incoming substrates being placed in the protein hydrophobic pocket and sandwiched between two tryptophan residues.

Achieved computational results suggested that the electronic and steric characteristic of the environment, in which the iron metal is placed, can be responsible for the reported differences of the carbene electronic structures. 134 For instance, the quantum mechanics (QM) and QM/molecular mechanics (MM) calculations of the styrene cyclopropanation by EDA promoted by iron porphine (the parent compound of porphyrin having hydrogen atoms on the four meso-positions), bearing either a methyl thiolate or a methoxide as the axial ligand, revealed the formation of the OSS state as the most stable carbene intermediate.

        <p>In view of the influence of the molecular architecture in determining the catalytic mechanism of the cyclopropanation, L. Toma, B. Boitrel, E. Gallo and co-authors studied the effect of the tridimensional arrangement of the porphyrin skeleton on the stereocontrol of the reaction. 80 As previously discussed, the C 2 symmetrical porphyrin Fe(79)OMe was responsible for very efficient diastereo-and enantio-discriminations. Thus, In order to better understand the role of the entire skeleton of this chiral porphyrin, a very detailed DFT investigation was undertaken. A considerable effort was devoted to modelling the whole molecule in order to evaluate the real influence of the environment surrounding the metal atom in driving the reaction outcome. Fe(79)OMe was stable in the sextet state (S=5/2), as also revealed by magnetic measurements, 79 and the DFT analysis disclosed two different conformations as the most stable. The computational analysis of the reaction of Fe(79)OMe with EDA indicated the possible formation of both the bridged and terminal carbenes, in the respectively preferred quartet and doublet state. The former bridged carbene was more stable by about 20 kcal/mol than the terminal one, which resulted being the active catalytic species in the alkene cyclopropanation. Next, the DFT analysis of the -methylstyrene reaction with the terminal carbene permitted the optimization of four TSs, namely two trans-TSs, which are responsible for the formation of the two enantiomers of the trans-cyclopropanes and two cis-TSs that evolve into the other two enantiomers in cis-configuration. Calculations indicated that the two trans-TSs were considerably more stable than the two cis-TSs because in the cis-approach the styrene phenyl group pointed towards the most crowded region of the molecule (Fig. 11). Thus, theoretical calculations furnished a geometrical explanation for the excellent diastereoselectivities achieved in the Fe(79)OMe-catalyzed cyclopropanations. On the other hand, there was only a small energy difference between the two trans-TSs, which justifies the incomplete differentiation between the enantiomeric reaction paths of the cyclopropanation of some alkene substrates. Successive computational investigations took into account the possible reduction of Fe(79)OMe by EDA to give an in situ reduced form of the catalyst and evidenced that the reduced species performs much better than the oxidized one due to the higher stability of the OS singlet terminal carbene intermediate and the lower energy barrier of the TS leading to it.In view of the influence of the molecular architecture in determining the catalytic mechanism of the cyclopropanation, L.

The analysis of the high number of reported studies has allowed the identification of some general mechanisms and among them, two pathways were proposed passing through the formation of a carbene intermediate (Scheme 47). The C-H functionalization was suggested occurring through either a concerted mechanism (path a), with the direct insertion of the carbene species into the hydrocarbon moiety, or a stepwise mechanism (see below).

Even if corrole catalysts were very selective towards the single insertion of the carbene fragment into a primary RNH 2 bond, the product of the second insertion was obtained by treating 178a with an EDA excess. Also secondary amines showed a good reactivity in the presence of iron corroles as demonstrated by the functionalization of morpholine that produced 179 in a good yield. An interesting approach for the synthesis of non-protected amino acids was reported by Z. Gross and co-authors by using Fe(TPP)Cl (1) as catalysts for the carbene transfer from diazoacetates to ammonia. 177 The reported data showed that the selectivity of the 1-catalyzed N-H insertion can be modulated by changing the NH 3 /EDA ratio as well as the reaction solvent. The use of ammonia as the nitrogen source may produce three different products depending if one, two or three carbene moieties have been inserted into the N-H bond (Scheme 55). The desired glycine ester 180a was obtained with a 100% selectivity either by treating EDA at room temperature with a saturated solution of NH 3 in THF or by performing the reaction under a NH 3 flow.

        <p>The observed superiority of iron-porphyrinoids was ascribed to the poor coordination affinity of amines towards the iron center. This prevents a catalyst's deactivation, which conversely occurs in a larger extent when other catalysts are treated with amines. The N-H alkylation worked well also using ethyl 2-diazopropanoate ((CO 2 Et)(Me)CN 2 ) (EDP) as the carbene source both in organic solvents, using iron-porphyrinoid catalysts, and in aqueous solution, where either myoglobin (Mb) or the non-covalent conjugate between iron corrole 182 and BSA (bovine serum albumin) or HAS (human serum albumin) (Scheme 56) were used as promoters. Unfortunately, no chiral induction was observed in the presence of myoglobin or a serum albumin. Catalysts 175-177 and 1 were also active in alkylating S-H bonds of thiols by using both EDA and EDP as the carbene precursors (Scheme 57). 178 The N-H functionalization was also investigated by G.

        <p>The C-H alkylation can be a valuable procedure for the functionalization of biologically relevant scaffolds, such as indoles. Q.-L. Zhou and co-authors reported both the achiral and the chiral version of the synthesis of substituted indoles by using -aryl--diazoesters as the alkylating reagents and Fe(ClO 4 ) 2 as the iron source. The ligands TMEDA (TMEDA = N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) and the spiro-bisoxazoline (R a ,S,S)-125 (Fig. 12) were employed for the achiral and enantioselective reaction, respectively (Scheme 69). 188 The catalytic Fe(ClO 4 ) 2 /TMEDA combination was efficient for the alkylation of differently substituted 1-benzylindoles in the C-3 position. When the C-3 position of indole was substituted, as in the case of the reaction of 3-methyl-1-benzylindole with methyl phenyl diazoacetate ((CO 2 Me)(Ph)CN 2 ), the alkylation took place at the C-2 indole position in a good yield (72%). The asymmetric functionalization occurred with enantioselectivities from moderate to good (39%-78% ee). In order to envisage a catalytic mechanism, the kinetic isotope effect (KIE=k H /k D ) was investigated by reacting the diazo reagent with an indole/C-3 deuterium-labeled indole mixture. The obtained KIE value of 5.06 indicated that the C-H cleavage should be the rate-determining step of the cycle. The authors proposed that the C-3 functionalization occurred through the formation of the metal-associated zwitterionic intermediate A and then the HAT reaction is responsible for the formation of the final compound (Scheme 70). Chiral spiro-bis-oxazolines were also employed as ligands in the iron-mediated alkylation of Si-H bonds. 189 6 The catalytic (R a ,S,S)-126/Fe(OTf) 2 /NaBAr F combination was very active in promoting the synthesis of α-silyl esters depicted in Scheme 71 (see Fig. 12 for the structure of (R a ,S,S)-126). The presence of NaBAr F was probably necessary to provide the coordinatively unsaturated [Fe(OTf)((R a ,S,S)-126)](BAr F ) active catalyst, displaying the non-coordinated BAr F anion. The synthetic protocol furnished desired compounds in yields up to 99% and ee up to 96%. The study of the kinetic isotope effect indicated that the Si-H bond cleavage was not the ratedetermining step of the reaction, which probably consisted in the concerted oxidative addition of the Si-H bond which was followed by the hydride insertion.

        <p>A deeper investigation of the alkylation of non-activated aromatic C(sp 2 )-H bonds was undertaken by using both experimental and theoretical approaches. 192 The catalytic procedure reported above 191 for the functionalization of aromatic C-H bonds required two equivalents of NaBAr F , with respect to complex 237, to allow the reaction to proceed. This indicated that two available coordination sites on the metal center are necessary for accomplishing the carbene insertion. The computational analysis of the reaction between 237 and EDA revealed that the first step of the reaction is the formation of an adduct, in which the iron metal is coordinated to the oxygen atom of the diazo carbonyl group. The coordination of either the carbon atom of the C=O functionality or the EDA nitrogen atom was less energetically favored. The adduct can be transformed into the carbene intermediate by passing an energy barrier of 29.5 kcal/mol and extruding molecular nitrogen. DFT data indicated the formation of a carbene with an iron(III) metal coupled with a radical alkyl substituent (see Scheme 39b for the general structure of a diradicaloid iron(III) compound). The electronic structure of the proposed iron(III) carbene resembles that described in the iron(II) porphyrin-mediated N-H alkylations as an open-shell singlet (OSS) iron(III) species. 133 Analogously to what was calculated by S.

Besides the three different pathways calculated for the decomposition of A, the carbonyl-assisted insertion (path b) was the less energetically demanding.

The last coupling process is the rate-determining step of the cycle.

The achieved high chemoselectivity confers a practical importance to the methodology because collected molecules can be used as starting materials of other synthetic protocols in which the carbon-carbon double bond is the target functionality to transform. Very interestingly, the FeCl 2 •4H 2 O/(Sa,S,S)-249/NaBAr F catalytic system permitted the use of water as the acceptor substrate of the carbene transfer process. Several diazo reagents were active in the reaction with H 2 O forming chiral alcohols which are valuable reagents in many organic transformations.The reported system was competent in inserting the carbene functionality into the O-H bond of several alcohols also in the presence of functional groups which would be potentially reactive towards diazo reagents, such as C=C double bonds.

        <p>In this review we furnished the state of art of the catalytic activity of iron complexes with nitrogen ligands (porphyrinoids and non-heme ligands) in transferring the carbene functionality from a diazo reagent (or its precursor) to C=C, C-H and X-H bonds. As depicted in Chart 1, great effort has been devoted to developing porphyrin-based cyclopropanation catalysts for conferring enhanced diastereo-and/or enantioselectivity to the reaction. The analysis of literature data revealed that the commercially available Fe(TPP)Cl (1) was an excellent catalyst under different experimental conditions. It activated diazo reagents both in the presence and in the absence of a reducing agent and showed a remarkable chemical stability, which permitted performing catalytic reactions both in organic and water medium as well as under basic or acid conditions. Thus, the use of porphyrin catalysts, whose synthesis requires time consuming and expensive experimental procedures, has to be justified by additional benefits, such as the stereoselective synthesis of cyclopropanes. With this goal, chiral iron porphyrins were synthesized. An increasing attention has been focused on the catalytic ability of engineered iron enzymes, in which the activity of the iron tetrapyrrolic core is coupled to the chiral arrangement of the biological pockets. While synthetic iron porphyrins usually show the metal in the oxidation state +3, artificial biocatalysts display an iron(II) in the pyrrolic cavity. It was assumed that in both cases the active species is an iron (II) carbene intermediate, whose electronic structure is currently a topic of scientific discussions. Iron complexes of non-heme nitrogen ligands (Chart 1) were usually synthesized in situ by mixing an iron(II) salt with the desired neutral ligand. A co-catalyst, showing a noncoordinating anion, is usually added to render the metal center coordinatively unsaturated and in turn more reactive. Also in these catalytic reactions, the formation of an iron carbene intermediate was proposed as the key-step of the catalytic mechanism. Even if iron(III) porphyrins were also extensively employed in carbene insertion in C-H and X-H bonds, the enantioselective version of these reactions was widely developed by using achiral and chiral non-heme ligands (Chart 2). Non-heme iron complexes were active in alkylating poor reactive aromatic C(sp 2 )-H bonds and interesting results were achieved in the synthesis of amino acids by reacting diazo compounds with amines. Alcohols and even water were suitable substrates for carbene transfer reactions. The formation of active ylide intermediates was suggested for the alkylation of X-H bonds.In this review we furnished the state of art of the catalytic activity of iron complexes with nitrogen ligands (porphyrinoids and non-heme ligands) in transferring the carbene functionality from a diazo reagent (or its precursor) to C=C, C-H and X-H bonds.

        <p>Regarding the diazo reagents, it should be noted that new procedures (flow chemistry) and the use of stable diazoprecursors have permitted the introduction of chemically different carbene fragments into organic frameworks by applying safe procedures (Chart 3). The analysis of published data revealed that carbene transfer reactions are becoming a useful and practical synthetic procedure for creating new C-C and C-X bonds. Reported data pave the way for a rapid future development of this strategy as much as and beyond other coupling reactions, which have received more attention in the last decades. In addition, the use of iron as the active metal represents an additional benefit in view of its low-cost and high eco-tolerability.

        <p>Considering the time-consuming procedure for synthesizing 211, the commercially available Fe(TPP)Cl (1) was employed as alternative catalyst for the gram-scale synthesis of 212i, which was isolated in a yield comparable to that observed in the presence of the iron complex 211. The difluoroalkenylation occurred only under basic conditions and when the reaction was run in neutral water, the classic S-H alkylation was observed. Based on experimental results, the authors proposed a general reaction mechanism in which the ylide, formed by the reaction of the substrate with the metal carbene intermediate, underwent a β-fluoride elimination under basic conditions affording the gem-difluoroalkenylation product together with the metal catalyst (Scheme 62).
