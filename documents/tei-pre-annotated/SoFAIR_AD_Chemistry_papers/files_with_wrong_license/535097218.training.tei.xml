        <p>Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are devices that can collect sunlight from a large area, concentrating it at the borders of the slab, to achieve efficient photovoltaic conversion when small area solar cells are placed at their edges, realizing building-integrated photovoltaics. Efficient luminophores in terms of high luminescence quantum yield are needed to obtain high-performance LSCs. A key point is the ability to engineer the Stokes shift (i.e. the difference between the maximum of the absorption and emission spectra), to minimize reabsorption processes. In this work, we report novel silicon-doped carbon nanodots (Si-CDs) with an ultrahigh quantum yield (QY) up to 92.3% by a simple hydrothermal method. Thin-film structured LSCs (5 × 5 × 0.2 cm 3 ) with different concentrations of Si-CDs are prepared by dispersing the Si-CDs into polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) matrix, and the optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LSCs can be as high as 4.36%, which is nearly 2.5 times higher than that prepared with silicon-undoped CDs. This Si-CDs/PVP film LSC has a high QY of 80.5%. A large-area LSC (15 × 15 cm 2 ) is also successfully fabricated, which possesses a PCE of 2.06% under natural sunlight irradiation (35 mW⋅cm -2 ), one of the best reported values for similar size LSCs. The efficient Si-CDs as luminescent substances for high-efficiency large-area LSCs will further give an impetus to the practical exploitation of LSCs.Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are devices that can collect sunlight from a large area, concentrating it at the borders of the slab, to achieve efficient photovoltaic conversion when small area solar cells are placed at their edges, realizing building-integrated photovoltaics.

        <p>Currently, the climate and environmental problems caused by the excessive use of fossil energy have led to a growing demand for renewable and clean energy. Solar energy is considered as a renewable and clean energy source, which can effectively alleviate energy shortage, and environmental and climate change issues [1][2][3][4]. Although solar technologies have been widely used, it is still a great challenge to reduce the cost of electricity generated by the solar cells. Meanwhile, it is also hard to further boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are large-area sunlight collectors, which enable the conversion of sunlight to electricity by photovoltaics (PVs) [1,5,6]. Typically, an LSC consists of a transparent waveguide substrate and a luminescent layer covering the surface of the substrate or embedded in it. The luminophore absorbs part of the sunlight and re-emits photons at longer wavelengths. Due to the total internal reflection, the emitted photons are waveguided to the edges of the waveguide substrate and further converted to electricity by the solar cells mounted at the slab edges [1,6,7]. LSCs can collect and redirect the sunlight from a large area to increase the conversion efficiency and reduce the area of the solar cells, thus reducing the cost of the electricity and increasing the potential of practical application of energy conversion systems. In addition, LSCs can be lightweight and semi-translucent with tunable color, which support their use in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) [1,5,[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]. However, many issues still exist that block the practical applications of LSCs so far [20]. The most critical one is the strong reabsorption energy loss of the luminescent material, which hinders the possibility of large-area LSC applications due to the overlap of absorption and emission spectra, resulting in heavy reabsorption losses [1,6,7]. Second, it is also important to reduce the efficiency losses due to parasitic absorption and scattering at optical defects and surface reflection at the lightguide surface [21]. The optical efficiency of LSCs depends not only on the optical properties of the luminescent materials, but also on the optical properties of the waveguide material. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient fluorophores with a broad absorption spectrum, high quantum yield (QY), small overlap between absorption and emission spectra (i.e. large Stokes shift (SS), the energy difference between the position of the absorption and emission maxima), and good stability, as well as the selection of suitable substrate materials [6].Currently, the climate and environmental problems caused by the excessive use of fossil energy have led to a growing demand for renewable and clean energy.

        <p>Various luminescent materials have been used as fluorophores for LSCs, such as organic dyes [22][23][24][25], aggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecules [26], metal nanoclusters [27,28], inorganic quantum dots [7,12,13,[29][30][31][32] and perovskite nanocrystals [33][34][35]. Compared with inorganic quantum dots containing toxic Pb or Cd, or expensive rare earth elements [13,14,33,36], carbon dots (CDs) are of great interest due to their easy synthesis, low cost, green and non-toxic composition [11,[37][38][39][40][41][42]. CDs have tunable absorption and emission spectra, high absorption coefficients, high photoluminescence QYs and excellent photostability [37][38][39][40]43,44]. For example, in 2017, N-doped CDs were used for the first time in single-layer LSCs with a lateral size of 2 × 2 cm 2 [45]. Based on this, several different luminescent CDs have been applied to large-area single-layer LSCs [46]. Recently, Zhao et al. synthesized CDs with a high QY (65%) and large Stokes shift (0.53 eV) based on a vacuum heating method and prepared large-area LSCs (15 × 15 cm 2 ) with external optical efficiency of 2.2% [47]. However, this synthesis method involves the use of vacuum.

        <p>In this work, we report a high-efficiency large-area LSC prepared from silicon-doped carbon nanodots (Si-CDs). Compared with Siundoped CDs, the luminescence intensity of Si-CDs and the performance of the as-prepared LSCs are greatly improved. Novel green emissive Si-CDs with QY up to 92.3% were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method using rhodamine B (RhB) and sodium metasilicate as precursors. The LSCs were prepared by drop coating the Si-CDs/polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) solution onto glass. The as-prepared large-area LSCs (15 × 15 cm 2 ) based on the Si-CDs exhibited a PCE of 2.06% under natural sunlight irradiation (35 mW⋅cm -2 ), which is one of the best values reported in the literature for similar size LSCs, after coupling to a Si solar cell on the slab edge.In this work, we report a high-efficiency large-area LSC prepared from silicon-doped carbon nanodots (Si-CDs).

        <p>Si-CDs were synthesized via a hydrothermal method using RhB and sodium metasilicate as precursors and water as solvent (Fig. 1). The morphology and structure of the Si-CDs were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The TEM image (Fig. 2a) shows that Si-CDs have uniform quasi-spherical shapes with sizes varying from 1.7 to 3.5 nm (average size ~ 2.7 nm) (Fig. S1). The lattice spacing of 0.21 nm (inset of Fig. 2a) corresponds to (100) lattice spacing of graphene [48]. From the XRD patterns (Fig. 2b), a broad diffraction band at 23.7 • and a single diffraction peak at 29.4 • could be ascribed to disordered carbon atoms and the (002) graphite lattice, respectively, which are very different from the crystalline structure of the RhB precursor [49]. The chemical structure of Si-CDs was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) (Fig. 2c). In the FT-IR spectrum of RhB, the peak at 1695 cm -1 indicates the presence of C--O from the carboxyl group; the peak at 1637 cm -1 indicates the presence of C--N; the peak at 1585 cm -1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations of C--C bonds, and the peak at 1332 cm -1 is assigned to the N-aryl stretching vibrations. Differently from that of RhB, Si-CDs exhibit characteristic peaks of O-H at 3436 cm -1 , COO -at 1390 cm -1 and Si-O at 1103 and 1024 cm -1 [50,51].Si-CDs were synthesized via a hydrothermal method using RhB and sodium metasilicate as precursors and water as solvent (Fig. 1).

        <p>The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum indicates the presence of C 1 s, N 1 s, O 1 s and Si 2p at 285, 532, 399 and 102 eV binding energy, respectively, with the corresponding contents of C, N, O and Si in Si-CDs equal to 63.1%, 1.9%, 25.7% and 9.3%, respectively (Fig. 2d). High-resolution XPS spectra depict more details about the chemical bonds of these elements (Fig. S2). The high-resolution spectrum of C 1 s reveals that Si-CDs contain C-C/C--C (284.8 eV), C-N/C-O (286.3 eV) and C--O (288.4 eV). The high-resolution spectrum of N 1 s can be decomposed into four peaks: pyridinic N (399.1 eV), amino N (400 eV), pyrrolic N (401.1 eV) and graphitic N (403 eV). The highresolution spectrum of O1s can be decomposed into three peaks: Si-O (530.8 eV), C-O (532 eV) and C--O (535.7 eV). The high-resolution spectrum of Si 2p can be decomposed into two peaks: Si-C (102.2 eV) and O-Si-O (103.1 eV), which is consistent with the FT-IR spectral results [51].The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum indicates the presence of C 1 s, N 1 s, O 1 s and Si 2p at 285, 532, 399 and 102 eV binding energy, respectively, with the corresponding contents of C, N, O and Si in Si-CDs equal to 63.1%, 1.9%, 25.7% and 9.3%, respectively (Fig. 2d).

        <p>The optical properties of Si-CDs were analyzed by UV-vis absorption spectra and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Si-CDs dispersed in aqueous solution have two distinct absorption characteristic peaks at 240 nm and 490 nm, which can be attributed to the π-π * transition and nπ * transition of surface states related to C--O, respectively. Si-CDs have a single emission peak at 510 nm under excitation at 490 nm. With increasing excitation wavelength, in the range 420-490 nm, Si-CDs exhibit excitation-independent emission (Fig. 3b). It indicates that the emission in Si-CDs originates from deexcitation from a single energy state. In addition, we measured the transient fluorescence decay of Si-CDs. Fig. 3c andd show the fluorescence behaviors of Si-CDs on the nanosecond time scale with an average lifetime of 4.8 ns and 4.5 ns under excitation at 343 nm and 490 nm, respectively. These lifetime values are within the typical range of the CDs, indicating that the luminescent recombination center is close to band gap. More notably, the QY of Si-CDs is as high as 92.3% (Fig. S3a), suggesting that the nonradiative transition seldom occurs in the Si-CDs [52]. It is found that sodium metasilicate as a dopant can improve the QY of CDs. First, the introduction of silicon can create a new surface state (the so-called silicon state) that traps electrons, increases radiative recombination, and suppresses nonradiative recombination. Second, silicon dopants acting as electron donors can increase the electron cloud density, thereby increasing the probability of electron-hole radiative recombination. Third, the functional groups can act as surface passivators, greatly preventing the vibration, rotation, and aggregation of CDs, ultimately reducing nonradiative processes [53].The optical properties of Si-CDs were analyzed by UV-vis absorption spectra and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra at room temperature.

        <p>We prepared a series of single-layer film-structured LSCs by drop based on Si-CDs are translucent but the transparency decreases with the increase of Si-CDs concentrations, while the "LSC" words at the bottom are still clearly visible. The bright yellow light from the edges of the thin film LSCs can be clearly seen under the illumination of the solar simulator (Fig. 4b). The thicknesses of the film LSCs based on Si-CDs with different concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3% were 74.6 µm, 84.3 µm and 97.4 µm, respectively (Fig. S4). There was an obvious redshift (~ 20 nm) in the absorption and PL emission spectra after embedding the Si-CDs into the PVP polymer matrix (Fig. 4c). This might be due to the more polar environment stabilizing the excited state, leading to a bathochromic shift of the absorption [54]. The red-shift of emission from aqueous solution to thin films may be due to the change of interparticle distance. Since there is a certain degree of overlap between the absorption spectrum and the emission spectrum, as the particle spacing of the carbon dots becomes smaller, the solid-state resonance energy transfer is caused, which makes the emission at long wavelengths relatively enhanced. However, the dilution effect of the aqueous solution can effectively enlarge the inter-particle distance and weaken the energy transfer in the carbon dots, resulting in a relative reduction in long-wavelength emission [55][56][57]. A significantly broad adsorption peak at 400-550 nm is observed and absorption intensity increases as the Si-CDs concentration increases (Fig. S5a). The PL spectra of LSCs have similar excitation-independent characteristics to Si-CDs, indicating that the PVP polymer does not affect the energy structure of Si-CDs (Fig. 4d). The lifetime of CDs/PVP film is 5.0 ns and 6.0 ns under excitation at 343 nm and 490 nm, respectively, which is a little longer than the lifetime of CDs in the solution (Fig. 3c andd). The as-prepared CDs/PVP film LSC has a high QY of 80.5% at the concentration of 0.2% (Fig. S3b). The acceptable variation of the PL lifetimes and QY before and after polymer encapsulation indicates the optical properties of the CDs does not change very significantly. To understand the pattern of variation of PL property of LSCs, PL spectra of LSCs with different concentrations were measured (Fig. S5b). We found that the PL intensity of LSCs increased significantly with the increase of Si-CDs concentrations.We prepared a series of single-layer film-structured LSCs by drop based on Si-CDs are translucent but the transparency decreases with the increase of Si-CDs concentrations, while the "LSC" words at the bottom are still clearly visible.

        <p>The photovoltaic parameters such as V oc , J sc , G, η opt and η for the film LSCs with different concentrations are listed in Table 1. Compared to Siundoped carbon dots, a dramatic increase in the total emission intensity is observed with Si-CDs (Fig. 5a). PCE is an important parameter to evaluate the optical performance of LSCs. A significant improvement on the PCE with Si-CDs could be observed, i.e. 1.77% for Si-undoped CDs and 4.36% for Si-CDs at the same concentration (Fig. 5b). The photovoltaic performance of the film-structured LSCs based on the different concentrations of Si-CDs is shown in Fig. 5c. The photocurrent density increases significantly with increasing Si-CDs concentration and then decreases slightly. The best values of V oc , J sc , η opt and η are obtained at 0.52 V, 11.3 mA/cm 2 , 4.8% and 4.4%, respectively, when the concentration of Si-CDs in the thin-film LSC is 0.2%. This is because there is a certain overlap between absorption and emission of Si-CDs, and the photons emitted from Si-CDs may be absorbed by themselves. Even if Si-CDs can re-emit new photons after absorbing the emitted photons, since the fluorescence quantum efficiency is smaller than 1, the fluorescence intensity of the edge is definitely smaller, resulting in a loss of the power conversion efficiency.The photovoltaic parameters such as V oc , J sc , G, η opt and η for the film LSCs with different concentrations are listed in Table 1.

This is because there is a certain overlap between absorption and emission of Si-CDs, and the photons emitted from Si-CDs may be absorbed by themselves. Even if Si-CDs can re-emit new photons after absorbing the emitted photons, since the fluorescence quantum efficiency is smaller than 1, the fluorescence intensity of the edge is definitely smaller, resulting in a loss of the power conversion efficiency.</p>
        <p>To study the stability of LSCs, the prepared LSCs were kept for 4 weeks under natural sunlight irradiation conditions (summer, Wuhan, China, the average daily light intensity: ~ 64 mW cm -2 , the average daily illumination time: ~ 10.5 h), and we measured the J-V characteristic curves of LSCs each week for five consecutive times (Fig. 5d). It is found that the PCE of the thin film LSCs based on Si-CDs does not change significantly, indicating the good stability of the LSCs based on Si-CDs.To study the stability of LSCs, the prepared LSCs were kept for 4 weeks under natural sunlight irradiation conditions (summer, Wuhan, China, the average daily light intensity: ~ 64 mW cm -2 , the average daily illumination time: ~ 10.5 h), and we measured the J-V characteristic curves of LSCs each week for five consecutive times (Fig. 5d).

        <p>To further evaluate the feasibility of large-area thin-film LSCs, we examined the effect of reabsorption for different concentrations of thinfilm LSCs. The Stokes shift is often used to quantify and rationalize this loss in LSCs, and it is generally accepted that SS is the key to influence the reabsorption of luminescent material in LSC devices. However, recent literature has demonstrated that the scalability of LSC devices is not necessarily correlated with SS, but depends on the total overlap of the absorption tail shape. Two redefined parameters have been used to better predict the effect of LSC reabsorption on scalability, namely the quality factor (QF) [59] and the overlap integral (OI): [54].To further evaluate the feasibility of large-area thin-film LSCs, we examined the effect of reabsorption for different concentrations of thinfilm LSCs.

        <p>Where A(λ) is the absolute absorption spectrum of a luminophore/host composite film, and PL * (λ) is the normalized emission spectrum of the luminophore in the host material. The calculated results of the relevant parameters are listed in Table S1. The QF and OI of LSCs gradually increase with the increase of Si-CDs concentrations, indicating that the influence of Si-CDs reabsorption gradually increases. The absorption peak position of the thin film LSCs remains unchanged, and the absorption coefficient gradually becomes larger. Meanwhile, the emission peak is slightly red-shifted, and the optical efficiency first increases and then decreases. The performance of LSCs is mainly the result of the combined effect of absorption efficiency and reabsorption loss. Due to the limited reabsorption and scattering losses of small-sized LSCs, their photovoltaic properties are severely overestimated, while practical applications require larger areas to meet life requirements. To get closer to the size of the device for practical applications and to verify whether the Si-CDs are reasonably scalable, we prepared a large-area film LSC with a size of 15 × 15 cm 2 by applying Si-CDs/PVP solution with the optimal concentration dropwise to the glass and then drying it. Fig. 6a andb show the optical photo of the large-area LSC and the photo under the solar light simulator. It can be seen that it maintains excellent translucency and still emits bright light at the edge of the glass despite the nine-fold increase in area. According to the method reported in the literature [47], we set up a distance-dependent PL measurement as shown in Fig. S6b. Usually, the distance-dependent red-shift of PL peak position or the narrowing of PL peak width is due to the reabsorption caused by the overlap between the absorption and emission spectra at the CDs. This phenomenon has been widely reported and used to evaluate the reabsorption energy loss in LSC [43]. As the distance between the light spot and the detector increases, there is almost no redshift of the PL emission peak and a slight narrowing of the PL peak width, as shown in Fig. 6c. The result suggests that this large-area LSC has an acceptable reabsorption loss to meet the scaling needs in practical applications.Where A(λ) is the absolute absorption spectrum of a luminophore/host composite film, and PL * (λ) is the normalized emission spectrum of the luminophore in the host material.

        <p>The PCE of the LSC was measured by using a calibrated silicon PV cell. The measurement of natural sunlight intensity was performed by using a commercially calibrated Zolix QE-B1 solar cell. Under natural sunlight, the film LSC based on Si-CDs exhibited similar J-V behavior to PV (Fig. 6d). The PCE of the LSC (15 × 15 cm 2 ) is as high as 2.06% upon a natural sunlight intensity of 35 mW⋅cm -2 . At a comparably high natural light intensity (70 mW⋅cm -2 ), the LSC still exhibits a PCE of 1.23%, which is relatively higher than the results of other similar studies (Table S2). The lower light intensity leads to a higher PCE, which may be due to the absorption limit of Si-CDs at higher light intensities [47]. This suggests that LSCs based on Si-CDs are well adapted for use in low-light weather.The PCE of the LSC was measured by using a calibrated silicon PV cell.

        <p>In summary, we first synthesized novel Si-CDs with an ultrahigh QY of 92.3% by a hydrothermal method, and then fabricated a series of the thin-film LSCs (5 × 5 cm 2 ) with different concentrations of Si-CDs. We investigated the photovoltaic properties and reabsorption patterns of the film LSCs with various concentrations. The results show that the PCE first increased and then decreased as the concentration of Si-CDs increased. The optimal performance of LSCs was achieved when the concentration was 0.2%, and the PCE value could reach 4.36%. In addition, the photostability of LSCs is very good. Based on its broad absorption and relatively low reabsorption loss, we applied the Si-CDs to prepare high-performance large-area LSCs (15 × 15 cm 2 ), which exhibited a PCE of 2.06% under natural sunlight irradiation (35 mW⋅cm -2 ) after coupling with a Si solar cell, which is one of the best values reported in the literature for similar size LSCs. The simple synthesis process, low cost and excellent optical properties of Si-CDs pave the way for practical applications of LSCs such as BIPVs.In summary, we first synthesized novel Si-CDs with an ultrahigh QY of 92.3% by a hydrothermal method, and then fabricated a series of the thin-film LSCs (5 × 5 cm 2 ) with different concentrations of Si-CDs.
