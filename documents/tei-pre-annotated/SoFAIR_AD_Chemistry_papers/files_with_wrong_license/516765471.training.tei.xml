        <p>Oxindole derivatives are known for their great interest in the field of Medicinal Chemistry, as they display vast biological activities. Recent efforts concerning the preparation of oxindole derivatives using isatin-based multicomponent reactions (MCRs) constitute a great advance in generating druglike libraries fast and with wide scaffold diversity. In this review, we address those recent developments, exploring the synthetic pathways and biological activities described for these compounds, namely antitumor, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. To add new depth to this work, we used a well-established web-based free tool (SwissADME) to evaluate the most promising scaffolds in what concerns their druglike properties, namely by evaluating their compliance with some of the most valuable rules applied by medicinal chemists in both academia and industrial settings (Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, Egan, Muegge). The aim of this review is to endorse isatin-based MCRs as a valuable synthetic approach to attain new hit compounds bearing the oxindole privileged structure, while critically exploring these scaffolds' druglike properties.</p>
        <p>The quest for bioactive molecules is the cornerstone of Medicinal Chemistry. Whether it happens via drug repurposing, structure-based design, privileged scaffold modifications and screening, the options are endless as regards the approaches that medicinal chemists can undertake to achieve their goals. With the ever-expanding toolbox medicinal chemists have available, it is necessary to keep in mind the multiple issues a molecule can experience from its first identification until it reaches the market. With high attrition rates and with the growing number of new approved drugs that have deviated from the classical chemical space explored this century, pharmaceutical industries are attempting more holistic approaches when addressing drug discovery processes [1e5].</p>
        <p>The scientific community, as well as regulatory authorities, are more aware of the environmental impact of their actions and Medicinal Chemistry is no exception to this. Green Chemistry applied to the field of Medicinal Chemistry is therefore a thriving field and is creating many solutions to make drug discovery and development processes more sustainable [6]. Although multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have been around since the second half of the 19th century, their role in drug discovery became pivotal in the most recent decades. By allowing the incorporation of three or more reactants into one single scaffold, MCRs unlock diversityoriented synthesis in a faster and more eco-friendly manner, due to its high atom economy and shorter synthetic pathways when compared to more classical approaches[7e10]. Furthermore, besides the prodigious impact MCRs possess in early-stage drug discovery, they are becoming more popularly applied in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), with the intention to reduce the number of synthetic pathways, waste production, resources usage and overall, improve sustainability scores for these processes [11].</p>
        <p>A common approach used by synthetic chemists in drug discovery is to explore the reactivity of privileged structures, incorporating them into more complex frameworks and screen their bioactive potential [12,13]. One important privileged structure is the oxindole scaffold, present in many bioactive compounds from natural and synthetic origins and even in APIs (Fig. 1) [14e20].</p>
        <p>Isatin is widely used as the starting point to generate oxindolebased libraries. Due to its unique reactivity, in particular at the carbonyl group at position 3, it allows a wide range of chemical transformations, including asymmetric catalytic reactions and MCRs [21e24]. Recent literature reviews are highly focused on the synthetic approaches to achieve spirooxindole derivatives, including via the application of MCRs to achieve such a goal [25e28]. However, a thorough literature survey focusing on the bioactivity and druglikeness of new oxindole-based molecules obtained through MCRs is long overdue.</p>
        <p>In this work, we aim to discuss the most recent reports in the application of isatin-based MCRs in the synthesis of a wide diversity of oxindole-based libraries, highlighting the different biological activities reported. Being aware of the impact of high attrition rates in the process of drug discovery [29,30], we decided to take this systematic review to a new stage, complementing the reported synthesis and biological activity evaluation with in silico assessment of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the most promising compounds. Many promising molecules fail in later stages of the drug discovery and development pipeline due to ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) issues and therefore the early detection of these phenomena is a milestone for medicinal chemists in both the academic lab and in a pharmaceutical industry setting. Several tools, filters and rules have been developed in order to predict and filter compounds, which structures could indicate poor druglikeness or indicate a likelihood to be Pan Assay interference compounds (Pan Assay Interference Structures (PAINS)) during bioactivity screening [31e35]. To encourage the widespread usage of such tools, several groups created easy to use and accessible platforms, so other researchers can explore the potential of such tools. Among them, we can highlight ADME-Space [36], ADMETlab [37], DRUDIT [38], Swis-sADME [39], just to name a few of the most recent examples. As many of these platforms present similar outputs, we decided to use the free web-based SwissADME tool in this work. This easy-to-use tool outputs include a wide range of physicochemical properties, lipophilicity evaluation, prediction of important pharmacokinetic parameters, determination of the presence of PAINS in the smallmolecules evaluated, as well as druglikeness determination according to five important and well established rules e Lipinski (Pfizer) rule of five, or simply Lipinski filter [40,41], Ghose filter [42], Veber (GSK) filter [43], Egan (Pharmacia) filter [44] and Muegge (Bayer) filter [45]. The main features/"conditions" of these rules/ filters are summarized in Table 1. Throughout this work, the most relevant molecules evaluated received a color code based on their result e red if they are not compliant with the rule, green if they comply with the rule and therefore exhibit druglikeness. Nonetheless, medicinal chemists need to be aware that the indications provided by these rules/filters are indicative, but not conclusive, as many examples of successfully marketed drugs are beyond the compliance with such rules/filters [46e48].</p>
        <p>SwissADME also provides a BOILED-Egg model, which is a visual representation of the gastrointestinal (GI) absorption and bloodbrain barrier (BBB) permeation of small-molecules, relevant for druglike compounds aiming to be administered orally [49], summarizing the main features of a molecule in a bioavailability radar.</p>
        <p>Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, with approximately 9.6 million deaths in 2018, from 18.1 million diagnosed patients around the world. According to World Health Organization (WHO), it is expected to rise by about 70% over the next two decades. Nearly one in six deaths is due to cancer [50,51]. Despite more sophisticated understandings of the disease and greater efforts for its early detection, the overall mortality rates from cancer have not diminished significantly and are not expected to decrease in the near future. Many natural and synthetic anticancer agents are available on the market, however these drugs are always associated with grievous side effects. The design and discovery of effective and selective antitumor agents continues to be a huge challenge and proof of that is the massive number of reports of new promising scaffolds and their antiproliferative activity every year. The oxindole core is a structural framework found in several natural and synthetic compounds with a wide range of bioactivities, where anticancer emerges as one of the most significant ones.</p>
        <p>Several research groups reported the synthesis and consequent anticancer activity evaluation of spirooxindole based molecules, using MCRs with isatin as starting material. In the following paragraphs the reader can find the corresponding synthesis and antiproliferative results of the most potent scaffolds, based on a spirooxindole framework, organized according to the number of components in the MCR, taking into consideration the structure and size of the spiro-ring and also concerning the bioassay and the cell lines studied. Examining the MCR itself and starting the screening with the use of three components as starting materials, a relatively high number of reports were found in the literature, with the purpose to obtain spiropyrrolidine-oxindole scaffolds. Nagarapu and co-workers reported the synthesis of some novel of hexahydrospiro[indoline-pyrrolizin]-one derivatives in good yields (18 examples -83e92%) using substituted isatins, L-proline and the synthesized (E)-3-(9-chloro-2,3-dimethyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-benzo [7]annulen-8-yl)-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one intermediates, in methanol under reflux temperature (Scheme 1A) [52]. The synthetic approach consisted of a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of azomethine ylides, generated in situ from isatin and proline derivatives, to activated dipolarophiles, which was also applied by other groups to get access to similar spiropyrrolidine-oxindole derivatives with some structural differences in the framework, depending on the dipolarophile used. For instance, the group of Kumar used chalcone derivatives (a,b-unsaturated ketones) as dipolarophiles in a similar 3-MCR approach to get a family of diastereoselective spiropyrrolidine-oxindole system (Scheme 1B) [53]. Using acetic acid as catalyst, the reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions (18 examples e 60e80% yield). Also, Barakat and co-workers reported a similar 3-MCR, using 2,6-bis[(E)-arylmethylidene]cyclohexanones to get access to a complex new family of di-spiro heterocycles incorporating pyrrolidine and oxindole rings (14 examples e 83e95% yield) (Scheme 1C) [54]. These last two families of spiropyrrolidine-oxindole derivatives were obtained in a regioselective manner. The results of the antiproliferative activity evaluation of the most promising compounds are depicted in Scheme 1D and 1E. After testing in a HeLa cell line (derived from human cervical cancer cells), despite the higher IC 50 values generally obtained, compared to the positive control doxorubicin, both compounds 1 and 2 showed promising results with IC 50 values of 3.8 mM for both [52]. In contrast, the assays in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB231) identified compound 4 from Kumar's group as a promising candidate, displaying IC 50 's of 3.7, 4.7, and 4.2 mM, respectively [53], and which were more potent that the positive controls used. No relevant antiproliferative activity was reported against other screened cell lines (A549human lung adenocarcinoma cells; SK-N-SH -human neuroblastoma cells; HepG2: hepatocellular carcinoma cells; K562: human leukemia cells).</p>
        <p>Analysis of the corresponding physicochemical properties and druglikeness of the described compounds, showed that only compound 1 was in agreement with Lipinski's rule, showing good oral bioavailability (Scheme 2). Despite having a predictive high gastrointestinal absorption, the poor druglikeness (driven mostly by lipophilicity, solubility and size issues -see Scheme 2 with the bioavailability radar of the most active compounds on human breast and cervical cancer cell lines) and inexistent BBB permeation led us to conclude that these scaffolds will likely offer future drawbacks in the drug development pipeline.</p>
        <p>By using recent promising in vitro results and the knowledge that spirooxindole scaffolds have been identified as key anticancer agents with the ability to bind to several cellular receptors[55e57], several researchers are currently working on the design of new hybrid structures, making structural modifications of the framework to get new compounds with high antiproliferative activity and improved safety profiles. The 3-MC 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction was the chosen procedure due to being a direct method for obtaining spiropyrrolidine based oxindole derivatives in a one-pot fashion. The reason behind the appearance of so many reports in the literature is due to the simplicity of this methodology, allied with mild reaction conditions and short reaction times. The robust 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between azomethine ylides (thermally generated in situ from isatin derivatives and proline, thioproline or sarcosine) and electron deficient olefins, has been used by several groups to build new libraries of spiropyrrolidineoxindole derivatives for antiproliferative bioassay studies. Ouyang and co-workers used substituted benzylidene-2-phenyloxazolone derivatives to develop a library (15 examples) of regio-and stereoselective oxazolones fused with spirooxindole-pyrrolidines in good yields (79e91%) (Scheme 3A) [58]. Barakat and co-workers used a similar protocol to report a library of new thiazolo- pyrrolidine-spirooxindoles linked with 3-acylindole scaffolds, also obtained in good yields (14 examples e 71e89% yield) (Scheme 3B) [59]. Parang, Ali and co-workers also found this approach to be well-suited to the preparation of a novel library of piperidone grafted spiropyrrolidine-oxindole derivatives using 3,5-bis[(E)arylmethylidene]tetrahydro-4(1H)-pyridinones as 1,3dipolarophile (42 examples e 85e95% yield) (Scheme 3C) [60]. The group of Liu and Zhou used 3-methyl-4-nitro-5-isatylidenylisoxazoles and 3-methyl-4-nitro-5-alkenyl-isoxazoles as 1,3dipolarophiles for the successful synthesis of polycyclic 3,3 0 -pyrrolidinyl-dispirooxindoles (Scheme 3D and 3E). The introduction of four stereocenters in the scaffold (33 examples e in 62e85% yields considering a fused oxindole unit and 40 examples in 64e90% yields considering a isoxazole) with good diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20:1) was the reason that this new isoxazole-fused spiropyrrolidine oxindoles may be potential leads against several cancer cells lines [61,62]. Perumal and co-workers used a complex indole-type intermediate linked to an imidazole unit as the 1,3dipolarophile to afford novel spiropyrrolidine-oxindole derivatives in good to excellent yields (29 examples e 82e95% yield) (Scheme 3F) [63].</p>
        <p>The design of new hybrid architectures is the principal objective of many groups for the generation of druglike molecules. All the new families of spiropyrrolidine-oxindole derivatives mentioned above were screened for their cytotoxic activities against a wide spectrum of cell-lines. The most promising compounds are depicted in Scheme 4.</p>
        <p>Upon analysis of the druglikeness predictions of the top nine described spiropyrrolidine-oxindoles (Scheme 5A) we can conclude that all the compounds (with the exception of 6) are in agreement with Lipinski's rule of five. The violation of some remaining rules (especially the Ghose's rule) is related to the higher values of molar refractivity and in some cases high molecular weight. The Boiled-Egg model (Scheme 5B) shows high GI absorption for almost all of the compounds (except for compound 14), predicting good overall oral bioavailability. Taking into account the bioassays performed in some of the carcinoma cell lines and all the physicochemical property data that was obtained, we conclude that compounds 10 and 12 could be lead compounds for the design of more potent and selective anticancer agents (Scheme 5C).</p>
        <p>Dandia, Jain and co-workers proposed that the design of hybrid heterocyclic systems with spirooxindole fused pyrrolo [1,2c]thiazole skeletons and naphthoquinone units could increase their biological activities. Consequently they reported the synthesis of a new family of spiroheterocyclic compounds, incorporating those three pharmacophoric components using a guanidium based ionic liquid (IL) (1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine acetate [TMG][Ac]) as green solvent [64]. Decarboxylative condensation of the substituted isatin derivative with L-thioproline affords the corresponding azomethine ylide which subsequently undergoes a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction with the 1,4-naphthoquinone and subsequent tautomerization and rapid oxidation under atmospheric conditions resulting in the formation of the described spiro[benzo[f]thiazolo [4,3-a]isoindole-5,3 0 -indoline]-2 0 ,6,11-trione derivatives (Scheme 6). Despite the poor substrate scope, good recyclability of the IL, mild reaction conditions and easy work-up are the main advantages of this procedure. With this small family in hand, the authors reported a preliminary study on a DNA cleavage assay, where the inhibitory potency of the compounds was evaluated. All the samples showed complete cleavage of DNA (in an agarose gel electrophoresis experiment), indicating that they should demonstrate antiproliferative activity. Small-molecule interactions with DNA continues to be a hot-topic in the field of anticancer drug development. This is because molecules that target DNA are more likely to achieve better outcomes with volunteers in cancer clinical trials when used with other drugs with different mechanisms of action [65].</p>
        <p>Several authors used sarcosine along with isatin derivatives as starting materials to form the azomethine ylide intermediates for 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition 3-MCR leading to spiropyrrolidineoxindole derivatives with novel complex frameworks (Scheme 7). Perumal's group used this strategy to obtain a family of spiropyrrolidine-oxindole derivatives in good yields (22 examples e 80e92% yield) using 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-oxo-2-(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)propanenitrile as dipolarophile (Scheme 7A) [66]. The group of Zhou and Lin used dienones as dipolarophiles to access a family of novel turmerone motif-fused spiropyrrolidine-oxindole derivatives in good yields (Scheme 7B) (25 examples e 70e93% yield). The desired products bearing adjacent chiral carbon centers were smoothly obtained also with good diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) [67]. Barakat and co-workers reported the synthesis of one spirooxindole analogue based on the same 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of isatin, sarcosine and the olefin (</p>
        <p>In just two hours the desired compound was obtained with 73% yield [68]. Mohan and co-workers used a similar strategy to obtain 4-hydroxyquinolin-2(1H)-one grafted spiropyrrolidine hybrids (7 examples e 46e92% yield) (Scheme 7D) [69].</p>
        <p>It should be noted that despite the structural complexity of the compounds described above, their druglikeness predictions were very encouraging (Scheme 8). Overall, the selected compounds 15e20 presented excellent compliance with these rules, particularly 17 and 18, which were compliant right across the board, making them good orally available drug candidates (Scheme 8B). The bioavailability radar for the most promising scaffolds was also displayed on Scheme 8C [67]. This is quite relevant as these compounds showed better antiproliferative profiles in bioassay studies with A549 and K562 cell lines (human lung cancer and leukemia) than the bench-mark, cisplatin.</p>
        <p>Mohan and co-workers also explored a variation of the 1,3dipolar cycloaddition reaction discussed so far, replacing the sarcosine by phenylglycine, using the same reaction conditions (Scheme 9A). Three new oxindole-fused 4-hydroxyquinolin-2(1H)one grafted spiro-phenyl substituted pyrrolidine hybrids were obtained in good yields (63e83%) and also screened in the antiproliferative assay [69]. Using tyrosine as the amino acid, the bnitrostyrene derivatives as dipolarophiles and common and commercially available ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([Bmim]Br) as green reaction medium, Kumar et al. reported very recently a new family of spiropyrrolidine-oxindole derivatives with very good yields (12 examples e 88e94% yield) (Scheme 9B) [70]. Increasing the scope of the amino acids and using electron-deficient alkynes as dipolarophiles, Meshram and coworkers reported the synthesis and corresponding cytotoxicity properties of a new family of spirooxindole derivatives (Scheme 9C). Several advantages of this 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition strategy using isatin derivatives, amino acids and but-2-ynedioates could be pointed out, such as good reaction yields (70e93%), suitable scope (28 examples), as well as a catalyst-and base-free approach. The use of microwave radiation significantly decreases the reaction time (10 min) and allowed the use of water as solvent in this synthetic transformation [71]. Using the same alkyne derivatives, the group of Zhang and Shi also reported the synthesis of a new family of spirooxindole-based 2,5-dihydropyrrole derivatives using the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition 3-MCR strategy (Scheme 9D). Despite long reaction times (16e36 h) and the need for a catalyst (trifluoroacetic acid), excellent scope and moderate to excellent yields (36 examples e 52e99% yield) were accomplished for this new family of compounds [72].</p>
        <p>Similar to the previous examples, these new libraries of spirooxindole derivatives were also evaluated for their cytotoxic properties in some human cancer cell lines. Their druglikeness was also predicted (Scheme 10).</p>
        <p>Spiro-substituted-pyrrolidine oxindole derivatives (Scheme 10) apparently showed similar physicochemical and druglikeness profiles to their unsubstituted counterparts (Scheme 8), with the exception of compound 25 which does not fulfil the requirement of four of the five druglikeness rules. In terms of preliminary evaluation of the cytotoxicity, compound 25 (and also 26) displayed poor inhibition in MCF-7 (Scheme 10B). Compounds 23 and 24 exhibited potent cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines MCF-7, A549 and HeLa, compared with the control, doxorubicin. Total agreement with the druglikeness profile and high GI could indicate potential oral bioavailability (Scheme 10C). The problems with poor solubility and high molecular weight probably makes their BBB permeability an issue (see Boiled-Egg model in Scheme 10D).</p>
        <p>Very recently, Mohan and co-workers described the one-pot 3-Scheme 3. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides with electron deficient olefins applied in the synthesis of spiropyrrolidine-oxindole derivatives.</p>
        <p>MC 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between azomethine ylides (formed in situ from the condensation of 5-substituted isatin derivatives and benzylamine) and (E)-3-arylidene-2,3-dihydro-8nitro-4-quinolones (Scheme 11A). Despite moderate reaction scope (12 examples), the high yields (90e96%) and mild reaction conditions employed are certainly the main advantages of this protocol. The use of cheap and easily available benzylamine (rather than expensive amino acids) is also an advantage of this synthetic protocol for accessing complex spiropyrrolidine oxindole frameworks. They were screened against HeLa cells and three compounds (27e29) were found to be the most active (Scheme 11B). These compounds were non-cytotoxic against normal cells (human RBC cells) [73]. However, the druglikeness profile was not very encouraging, since some of the compounds were non-compliant with some of the rules, displaying poor solubility, high molecular weight and high molar refractivity, which can cause low oral availability and subsequently pharmacokinetic issues. Rizk and co-workers reported the synthesis of spiropyrrolidinebased thiophene oxindole derivatives using the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition 3-MCR approach with thioglycolic acid instead of the commonly used amino acids (Scheme 12A). Despite the poor reaction scope, the desired spiro derivative (see compound 30 as an example) was obtained in good yield (80%). In an attempt to expand the complexity of the framework it is worth noting that the corresponding 2-(4'-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methyl-1 0 ,2-dioxo-7 0 ,7a 0dihydro-1 0 H-spiro[indoline-3,5 0 thieno [3,4-d]pyridazin]-2 0 (4a 0 H)yl)acetohydrazide 31, was obtained in good yield (78%) [74]. Also, the group of Hamama used the MCR approach with isatin, 1,3,4thiadiazol-2-amine and hydrazinecarbothioamide in acetic acid (and ethanol) to access the N-(2-oxo-4 0 -(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-2 0 ,4 0 -dihydrospiro[indoline-3,3 0 -[1,2,4]triazole]-5 0 -yl)acetamide 32 in good yield (75% yield, Scheme 12B) [75].</p>
        <p>The cytotoxicity of compounds 30 and 31 was evaluated in MCF-7 and human lung fibroblast WI-38 cell lines. Despite the poor cytotoxicity results obtained for compound 30, the druglike properties using the SwissADME tool (the results are depicted in Scheme 12C) showed that it was compliant with all five rules, and the bioavailability radar predicted good oral bioavailability. In the case of 31, more potent cytotoxicity was in evidence for the same cell lines (Scheme 12C) [74]. The druglikness profile for compound 32, reported by Hamama and co-workers, with a complex spiro-2-(1,5-dihydro-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole unit was far Scheme 4. Structures of the most promising compounds (A) and respective antiproliferative activity (B) ( a % activity at 25 mL/mL; b value reported in Ref. [59]; c value reported in Ref. [61]; d value reported in Ref. [62]) (MDA-MB-468: human breast cancer cells; HCCC-9819 and HuH7: hepatocellular carcinoma cells; HCT-116: colorectal cancer cells; PC-3: prostate cancer cells; CCRF-CEM: lymphoblastic leukemia cells; SK-OV-3: human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells). from ideal, failing to comply with two of the five applied rules (Scheme 12C). On the other hand an encouraging ED 50 of 40 mg/cm 3 was determined using the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells (EAC) cell line (exactly the same as the control 5-flourouracil). [75], indicating that careful modifications of this scaffold should improve oral bioavailability.</p>
        <p>Several authors reported the synthesis and corresponding antiproliferative bioassays of novel families of 6-ring spirooxindole scaffolds using 3-and 4-MCR approaches. For instance, Wu and coworkers reported the synthesis of spirooxindole-O-naphthoquinone-tetrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine hybrids with good scope and in general moderate yields (14 examples e 31e69% yield) using isatin derivatives, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 5aminotetrazole (Scheme 13A) [76]. Kamal et al. explored a green methodology to access pyrazolopyridine-based spirooxindoles by the 3-MCR between isatin derivatives, 5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3amine and tetronic acid (furan-2,4(3H,5H)-dione) or barbituric acid (pyrimidine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione) (Scheme 13B). The reaction showed good scope, affording the products with good to excellent yields (34 examples e 77e99% yield), using water as reaction medium and sulfamic acid (SA, with chemical formula H 2 NSO 3 H) as a reusable catalyst [77]. Liu and co-workers reported a 4-MCR protocol using pregnenolone, isatin derivatives, malononitrile and ammonium acetate to access steroidal dihydropyridinyl spirooxindoles with good yields and good scope (15 examples e 73e83% yield) (Scheme 13C). Mechanistically, it is expected that the reaction undergoes a Knoevenagel condensation and consequent Michael addition, ending with isomerization and cyclization steps to afford the desired products [78]. Mathew and co-workers used the well-known 3-MC Biginelli reaction approach to obtain a family of novel spirooxindole-dihydropyrimidinones in moderate yields (10 examples e 68e76% yield) (Scheme 13D). Metal nanoparticles (FeO 4 -NP) were used as the catalyst to perform this chemical transformation [79].</p>
        <p>The chemical structures and the antiproliferative results with the A549 cell line are depicted in Schemes 14A and 14B, respectively, as well as their druglikeness profile and physicochemical properties (Scheme 14C). The most promising compound was 37, bearing a spiro-pyrazolopyridine unit [77]. Compound 39, a steroidal dihydropyridinyl spirooxindole, exhibits remarkable antiproliferative activity in the human esophageal cancer cell line, EC-109, yet the poor druglikeness profile cannot be ignored [78].</p>
        <p>Major issues with solubility, lipophilicity and molecular weight makes it less likely to have appropriate oral bioavailability (see bioavailability radar in Scheme 14C). Also, low GI and inexistent BBB permeability indicate that it would make a poor drug candidate. Furthermore, the druglikeness predictions revealed that compounds 33, 34 and 40 fulfil the requirements of Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, Egan and Muegge rules and only compound 39 presents poor GI absorption according to the Boiled-Egg model. The in vitro screening for compound 40 performed in MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines, showed lower potency although its favorable druglikeness predictions indicate that it might be structurally modified to improve its cytotoxicity. Compounds 33 and 34 showed an unfavorable PAINS profile, due to the presence of quinone and iminone moieties.</p>
        <p>From the above discussion it was clear that isatin-derived compounds possessing cyclic structures attached at position 3 have been widely targeted over the last decade, in part due to their fascinating complex scaffolds and to their well recognized bioactivity. Like pyrrolidine-derived spiro rings, pyranone-spirooxindole hybrids were also synthesized using efficient and eco-friendly methods. In the context of this review, we found some reports on the synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation of these interesting frameworks, some of which are described below.</p>
        <p>Dhayabaran and co-workers described the synthesis of novel 10,10-dimethyl-9,10,11,11a-tetrahydro-6H-spiro[chromeno [4,3b] chromene-7,3 0 -indoline]-2 0 ,6,8(7aH)-triones using a 3-MCR approach involving isatin derivatives, cyclic ketones and 4hydroxycoumarin under green conditions (Scheme 15A). The use of mild conditions, water as solvent, short reaction times and no chromatographic work-up are the main advantages of this methodology. The desired spirooxindole derivatives were synthesized in good to excellent yields (14 examples e 74e98% yield) [80]. The group of Anbhule described the well-known 3-MCR involving isatin derivatives, malononitrile and 1,3-indanone to obtain a family of 2amino-3-cynospiro(5H-indeno [1,2b]pyran-4,3-indoline)-2 0 5diones with good reaction scope and good to excellent yields (14 examples e 83e96% yield, Scheme 15B). Briefly, the reaction proceeded through the preliminary construction of the Knoevenagel intermediate (formed between isatin and malononitrile) which acts as Michael acceptor for the 1,3-indanone. After cyclization and isomerization, the desired spirooxindole product was obtained under mild reaction conditions, in a catalyst-free approach using a mixture of water and DMF as solvent [81]. Using a similar synthetic protocol, Song and co-workers reported the synthesis of (E)-8 0arylidene-5 0 ,6 0 ,7 0 ,8 0 -tetrahydrospiro[oxindole-3,4 0 -pyrano [3,2c] pyridin] derivatives via one-pot 3-MCR of isatins, malononitrile and (E)-3-arylidene-1-methylpiperidin-4-ones using piperidine as catalyst and ethanol as an environmentally benign solvent (Scheme 15B). Very good substrate scope and moderate to excellent yields were obtained through this synthetic transformation (20 examples, 60e98% yield) [82]. Also the group of Perumal reported a similar strategy to easily prepare a library of spiropyrano [3,2b]pyran-4(8H)-ones using isatin derivatives, active methylenes (like malononitrile) and kojic acid (Scheme 15B). Using Cu(OTf) 2 as an efficient catalyst, a very good scope and good yields were obtained for this family (19 examples e 77e93% yield) [83]. The group of Kidwai explored the use of dimedone, 1,3-cyclohexanedione, 4hydroxycoumarin, barbituric acid, thiobarbituric acid and 1phenyl-3-methyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one as active methylene compounds in the 3-MCR approach along with isatin derivatives and malononitrile (Scheme 15B). They found that the use of iodide as a Lewis acid catalyst improved significantly the yields of the desired spirooxindole compounds and the remarkable scope of the reaction (42 examples) together with the use of water as solvent makes this synthetic 3-MCR an appealing strategy [84]. Sarkar and co-workers reported the synthesis of spiro-chromenocarbazole tethered 1,2,3triazoles via a one-pot 5-MCR approach between N-propargyl isatin derivatives, malononitrile, 4-hydroxycarbazole, aralkyl halides and sodium azide using cellulose-supported CuI nanoparticles (Cell-CuI-NP) as heterogeneous catalyst in a mixture of DMF and water as solvent (Scheme 15C). A vast library of spiro-chromenocarbazole tethered 1,2,3-triazoles derivatives was produced under smooth reaction conditions and good yields (27 examples e 81e92% yield) [85]. Like all the previous compounds described in this section, these spiro-based pyran-oxindole derivatives underwent a phenotypic screening campaign against some cancer cell lines to evaluate their cytotoxic behavior. The results are displayed in Scheme 16.</p>
        <p>At first sight, analysis of the in vitro screening against several human cancer cell lines, showed that several compounds display relevant biological activity (with IC 50 ranging from 6.3 mM to 30 nm for the most active compounds) and should be object of further studies. For instance, compounds 41 and 42, exhibited very good values of IC 50 in human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP [80]. The same can be stated for compounds 43 and 44, in what concerns the bioactivity against human breast cancer cell line MBD-MB-435 [81]. In fact, verifying the druglikeness profile for these two compounds, they fulfil perfectly the five rules. Despite promising antiproliferative results obtained in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and human cervical cancer cell HeLa, compound 50 failed to comply with the five rules, and issues concerning molecular weight, polarity, solubility, molar refractivity, among others, pointed out that this scaffold might not be the best lead compound. In our opinion, compounds 45 and 48 should be screened further in other tumor cell lines. The Boiled-Egg model for all these compounds is depicted in Fig. 2. Although none of the compounds are predicted to be capable of crossing the BBB e which would be crucial in the case they are used in neurological disorders -the vast majority are predicted to cross the GI barrier (except compounds 46 and 50e52).</p>
        <p>Kamal and co-workers decided to report a similar 3-MCR approach to obtain spiro-benzodiazepine derivatives with facile one-pot formation of CeC and CeN bonds, with consequent formation of a 7-member ring size spirooxindole (Scheme 17A). Using isatin derivatives, o-phenylenediamines and tetronic acid, the inexpensive sulphamic acid (NH 2 SO 3 H, SA) as catalyst and water as reaction medium a library of 4,9-dihydrospiro[benzo[b]furo [3,4e] [1,4]diazepine-10,3 0 -indoline]-1,2 0 (3H)-dione derivatives was obtained in good yields and good reaction scope (21 examples e 77e90% yield). The cytotoxicity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated on the selected human cancer cell lines, that included A549, MCF-7, DU-145 and HeLa. The results exhibited promising cytotoxicity activities for compounds 53e55 (Scheme 17B) [86]. Druglikeness predictions revealed full compliance with all the five rules by the three most active derivatives, showing also good GI absorption, with compound 54 predictively displaying the ability to cross the BBB (Scheme 17C).</p>
        <p>From all these compounds, it is noteworthy the scaffold diversity attained via MCRs. Nonetheless, these compounds have in common a spirooxindole nature, with some of the most active being unsubstituted at position 1 (6, 23, 19, 41, 53 and 55), although some good results were obtained for N-substituted derivatives (35, 39, 42 and 54). Multiple spirocenters (6) or adjacent chiral centers (19) led to important anti-tumor activity, but one of the most common features is the presence of a tricyclic or pentacyclic structure at position 3 of the oxindole core, as observed for compounds 35, 41, 42, 53, 54 and 55.</p>
        <p>Tuberculosis is a very complex infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which represents the leading bacteriarelated cause of death worldwide, and it is facing many challenges, including lack of therapeutic compliance, multidrug resistance, and clinical manifestations in immunosuppressed patients. Despite the increasing number of drugs and vaccines currently in the preclinical and clinical trials pipeline, the quest for new compounds with higher selectivity, efficacy and better pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles persists[87e89]. Indeed, a recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) places this pathogen as a top priority infectious agent for the discovery and development of new drug candidates [90].</p>
        <p>Several 3-MCR in methanol or methanol/water mixtures have been recently described to obtain new anti-tubercular agents. Kumar et al. reported the synthesis of highly functionalized dispiropyrrolidine derivatives (38 examples) in moderate yields (32e52%) (Scheme 18A). These compounds were obtained through the 3-MCR between isatin, cyclic mono ketones and sarcosine or phenylglycine. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the vast majority of the compounds was determined against M. tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) using agar dilution method. The values obtained for several compounds (56e60) were in the same range as the ones obtained for the positive controls isoniazid, ciprofloxacin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide, marketed drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis (Scheme 18B) [91].</p>
        <p>Other research groups dedicated their attention to the threecomponent 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction, obtaining new spirooxindole derivatives with antitubercular activity. Mhiri et al. explored the reaction between isatin, (Z)-3-arylidenebenzofuran-2-ones and 1,3-thiazolane-4-carboxylic acid or sarcosine (Scheme 19A). A library of 28 derivatives was prepared in very good yields (71e89%) and short reaction times and their activity against MTB accessed, using the agar dilution method and the previously mentioned four positive controls, as well as rifampicin. Ten compounds (61e70) displayed MICs similar or lower than the one presented by the positive controls, showcasing the potential of these frameworks as new antitubercular agents. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of the most active compounds (61 and 62) was also evaluated using RAW 264.7 (Mouse monocyte macrophages) cells and displayed low cytotoxicity (27.5% and 20.7%, respectively, at 50 mM) (Scheme 19B) [92].</p>
        <p>The same type of reaction was later explored by Sapnakumari et al., but this time using chalcone derivatives as dipolarophiles, combining them with isatin and different amino acids (Scheme 20A). A small library of 8 compounds was successfully achieved in moderate yields (52e71%) and their in vitro activity against M. tuberculosis evaluated using microplate alamar blue assay (MABA), using pyrazinamide and streptomycin as positive controls. Compounds 71e73 displayed significant activity, four times higher than the one described for pyrazinamide. The remaining compounds displayed activities similar to the positive controls indicating, once again, the potential of spirooxindoles as antitubercular agents (Scheme 20C) [93]. A similar approach was undertaken by Pogaku et al., combining isatin, L-proline and chalcones to synthesize a library of 1,2,4-triazol-1-yl-pyrazole based spirooxindolopyrrolizidine derivatives (20 examples) in overall very good yields (78e92%) (Scheme 20B). The main advantage of this methodology is its short reaction times, promoted by using a reusable ionic liquid (IL) as reaction medium and ultrasonication as activation technique. The MABA assay was used to determine the MIC against MTB, using ethambutol as positive control. One compound in particular (75), proved to be the most active against M. tuberculosis, although compounds 76e81 displayed antitubercular activity similar to the positive control (Scheme 20D). Cytotoxicity was evaluated using RAW 264.7 cells, and low cytotoxicity was displayed by most compounds, including 75 (19.76%) at 25 mM [94].</p>
        <p>A totally different approach is the one recently described by Chavan et al., exploring a five-component reaction to prepare a library of 1,2,3-triazolylspirochromene derivatives (32 examples) from N-propargyl isatin, malononitrile, arylalkyl bromide, sodium azide and dimedone or 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (Scheme 21A). This methodology, which allowed the preparation of the desired compounds in very good yields (76e94%) and short reaction times (up to 5 h), was enabled by applying cellulose-supported CuI nanoparticles (Cell-CuI NPs) as an heterogeneous and reusable catalyst. The obtained compounds were then tested against MTB, using the XTT reduction menadione assay (XRMA), and M. bovis (BCG), using the nitrate reductase assay, both in active and dormant stage, and evaluating two parameters e MIC and IC 50 , using rifampicin as positive control. Compounds 82e84 and 85e89 displayed interesting bioactivity and good selectivity (Scheme 21B), as they did not demonstrate relevant cytotoxicity towards three different cell lines (MCF-7, HCT116 and A549) [95].</p>
        <p>Evaluating the inherent pharmacokinetic and druglike properties of the ten compounds which exhibited more interesting antitubercular activity in vitro, it is noteworthy that none of these compounds presented structures that could make them possible PAINS. With regard to the druglike properties of these compounds, it was observed that the top ten most active compounds comply with the Lipinski's rule of five (Scheme 22A). The violations of the remaining rules are connected to high molecular weight presented by some of these frameworks, high molecular refractivity predicted and high topological polar surface area (TPSA). The Boiled Egg GI absorption and BBB permeation prediction model also shows that most of these compounds (except 86, 88 and 89) present high GI absorption, relevant for oral bioavailability (Scheme 22B). The bioavailability radars of the two compounds which performed better in what concerns druglikeness rules compliance (58 and 71) show that despite the significant differences in these two structures, they present a good bioavailability score. On the other hand, the bioavailability radar for the worst performing compound (89) indicates that most of the physical-chemical properties remain close to the optimal value, and therefore, some tweaking of the molecular structure could lead to a more druglike compound (Scheme 22C).</p>
        <p>Besides tuberculosis, several other bacterial infections deserve attention, namely due to an alarming increase in multidrug resistance displayed by several pathogens. The attrition rate in introducing new antibiotic drugs to the market is very high, and the introduction of new classes of antibiotics used in clinical practice has been alarmingly low over the past decades. As a matter of fact, from 1986 to 2017, there have been no new classes of antibiotic introduced into the antibiotic pipeline, until the discovery of teixobactin, a secondary metabolite produced by some bacterial species which displays relevant bactericidal activity without displaying induced resistance (in an in vitro setting). Nonetheless, this compound is still in early stage preclinical development, and therefore the need to discover other new promising antibiotic drug candidates is imperative to tackle the "discovery void" of the past decades[96e100]. The WHO priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which takes into consideration multiple criteria, indicates the existence of three tiers of pathogens requiring particular attention in drug discovery and development, as shown in Fig. 3. This urgent need led several groups to perform antibacterial screening of newly synthesized compounds, including MCRobtained oxindole derivatives, namely spirooxindole derivatives [101]. Some of the products previously described for their antitubercular activity, were also tested for their antibacterial activity towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The library described in Scheme 20A was tested against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), with most compounds presenting similar antibacterial activity towards E. coli as the positive control ciprofloxacin, with a MIC of 20 mg/mL. This in vitro observation was further complemented using molecular docking studies of the newly synthesized compounds in potential prokaryotic targets. Compound 74 presents the best score in targeting the methionine tRNA synthase (showing some selectivity, as this compound did not exhibit good antitubercular activity), while compound 73 in silico binds more efficiently to the glucosamine-6phosphate synthase, indicating potential mechanisms of action for these compounds [93]. The 5-MCR products shown in Scheme 21A were also evaluated for their antibacterial activity towards two Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (NCIM 2688) and presented good selectivity and antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa [103]. Since this bacteria exhibits a wide range of antibiotic resistance mechanisms, this makes treatment of these infections increasingly challenging [104]. The researchers studied further the selectivity and antibiotic activity of this spirooxindole derivative, by determining its MIC against three other strains of Docking studies also suggest that compound 90 possibly interacts with multiple enzymes which are known antibiotic targets, such as lanosterol demethylase, dihydrofolate reductase and topoisomerase II, via hydrogen bonds involving the furanyl oxygen atom [103].</p>
        <p>Looking in more detail to the features of compound 90, SwissADME prediction shows that this chemical framework complies will the five druglikeness rules with no PAINS features detected. Further, its bioavailability radar, shown in Scheme 23F, indicates that the compound exhibits good potential to be administered per os, due to its high gastrointestinal absorption. By using different dipolarophiles, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is a very valuable methodology to attain a wide diversity of scaffolds, as summarized in Scheme 24.</p>
        <p>For example, by using 1,4-naphthoquinone, Bhaskar et al. explored the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition combining this framework with isatin and sarcosine (Scheme 24A) or L-proline (Scheme 24B) to prepare a library of spirooxindole derivatives (22 examples) in excellent yields (87e96%). The compounds were then screened for antibacterial activity against four Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus (MTCC 96), MRSA, Micrococcus luteus and Enterobacter aerogenes (MTCC 111)) and four Gram-negative bacteria (Proteus vulgaris (MTCC 1771), K. pneumoniae (MTCC 109), Salmonella typhimurium (MTCC 1251) and Salmonella paratyphi-B). While the L-proline derived spirooxindoles did not display relevant antibacterial activity, some of the sarcosine-based compounds exhibited relevant bactericidal effects, obtained using disc diffusion assays for all the compounds and then determination of the MIC for the most promising compounds. Among them, compound 91 stood out as the most active compound against both Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, in many cases exhibiting higher activity than the positive controls, streptomycin and ciprofloxacin. Compounds 92 and 93 also exhibited promising results, as shown in Scheme 25 [105].</p>
        <p>By combining isatin, sarcosine or 1,3-thiazoles-4-carboxylic acid with 2-cyano-3-phenyl-acrylic acid ethyl ester or 2-benzylidenemalononitrile, Dandia et al. reported the synthesis of a small library of spiropyrrolidine (8 examples)/thiapyrrolizidine (4 examples) oxindole derivatives, under microwave irradiation (Scheme 24C and 24D respectively). This methodology allowed the preparation of these derivatives in overall very good yields (88e92%) and short reaction times. The in vitro antibacterial activity of these spirooxindoles was then evaluated against E. coli (ATCC 9637), P. aeruginosa (ATCC BAA-427), S. aureus (ATCC 25923) and K. pneumoniae (ATCC 27736). When compared to the positive controls gentamicin and ampicillin, the MIC values were higher for all the compounds in the first three bacterial strains, however, surprisingly selectivity against K. pneumoniae was observed. Among all the compounds, the four thiapyrrolizidine derivatives (94e97) exhibited lower MIC than the two positive controls, with compound 96 displaying a remarkable MIC value of 5 ng/mL (Scheme 26). The authors further explored the in silico binding of this promising scaffold with New Delhi metallo-b-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) protein [106], a well-established and widespread resistance mechanism of K. pneumoniae and one of the main causes of antibiotic resistance in infections caused by this bacterium [107]. The potential to establish several bonds between this target protein and the oxindole moiety, namely two Hbonds, one electrostatic and one hydrophobic interaction, besides van-der-Walls interactions, suggests that this is a potential target for compound 96 [106].</p>
        <p>Hassaneen et al. also explored a three component 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition involving isatin, ethyl 3,5-bis[phenylmethylidene]-4-oxopiperidine-N-carboxylate as the dipolarophile and sarcosine (Scheme 24E -10 examples) or L-proline (Scheme 24F -10 examples). This synthetic approach, which allowed the preparation of these new spiro compounds in very good yields (79e95%) under straightforward conditions, was followed by antibacterial screening against two Gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae (RCMB 010010) and B. subtilis (RCMB 010067)) and two Gramnegative bacteria (P. aeruginosa (RCMB 010043) and E. coli (RCMB 010052)), using ampicillin and gentamicin as positive controls for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The compounds exhibited antibacterial activity against most of these bacteria, often displaying a MIC lower than the one exhibited by the positive control, except for P. aeruginosa, to which only compound 98 presented antibacterial activity comparable to gentamicin. For the remaining bacterial strains, the most active compounds were 98e101, displaying promising MICs and IC 50 s (Table 3), in particular compound 101 [108].</p>
        <p>Switching the dipolarophile to 5-arylidine-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one, Barakat et al. synthesized two new polycyclic (102 and 103) spirooxindole derivatives (85e89% yields) via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (Scheme 24G). The antibacterial activity against the same four bacteria tested in the previous example was accessed, through the determination of the MIC value. In the case of the four bacteria, the compounds exhibited similar or even lower antibacterial activity when compared to the positive control. Despite the structural resemblance of the compounds, in silico studies indicated that 103 binds in a different manner to the protein target, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, than compound 102, leading to a possible justification to differences in antibacterial activity (Scheme 27) [109].</p>
        <p>Another example of a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition involving isatin, various amino acids (sarcosine, proline and thioproline; 8 examples) and (E)- and while most compounds exhibited some level of growth inhibition, their MIC values were considerably lower than the ones displayed by the positive control, streptomycin. The best results, displayed in Scheme 28B, were attained by compound 104 [110]. Concerning the predictive physical-chemical properties of this molecule, unfortunately it possesses low gastrointestinal absorption and poor druglikeness, probably due to its high molecular weight and lipophilicity (Scheme 28C).</p>
        <p>Looking closely to the structures of the most active compounds obtained via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and their respective physicochemical properties prediction and druglikeness, some details need to be taken into consideration. Firstly, several of these compounds present excellent druglike properties and we would like to highlight the case of compound 96, which is one of the most active of all these derivatives and highly selective against K. pneumoniae. Other compounds, such as 91e93, despite being compliant with these rules, present a major drawback, which is the presence of the quinone moiety, a well-known PAINS. Rhodanines, present in the scaffold of compounds 102 and 103 are also well-established PAINS and therefore their potential as antibiotic agents might be limited.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, out of these thirteen compounds, only one (97) does not present a predictive good gastrointestinal absorption, according to the boiled-egg model (Fig. 4). This feature makes these oxindole-derivatives obtained via 3-component 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition highly promising as potential antibiotic agents to be administered per os.</p>
        <p>Knoevenagel/Michael addition MCRs are often applied in the context of Medicinal Chemistry and there are also some recent examples of this approach in the synthesis of new isatin-based antibacterial drug candidates (Scheme 29).</p>
        <p>Ramadoss et al. developed a small library of six derivatives (86e93% yield), using tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as the catalyst for the three-component reaction between isatin, malononitrile and cyclic 1,3-diketones (Scheme 29A). The obtained compounds were screened in what concerns their antibacterial activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, but the compounds were revealed to be substantially less active than the positive control ciprofloxacin [111]. The heterogeneous-catalyzed three component reaction between isatin, malononitrile and 3methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine (Scheme 29B), using NiO 2 eSiO 2 as the acid catalyst, was explored in the preparation of spirooxindole-fused pyrazolo pyridine derivatives (13 examples) in very good yields (85e95%). The determination of the growth inhibition zone induced by these compounds against K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, E. coli and B. subtilis showed weak antibacterial activity, with all the results being lower than the ones obtained for positive control streptomycin [112].</p>
        <p>A different approach was reported by Moghaddam-Manesh et al., through the reaction between isatin, malononitrile and in situ generated (4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-cyclohexylidene)(mercapto)methanethiolate, from the reaction between dimedone and carbon disulfide (Scheme 29C). The generated small library (6 examples) was obtained in overall very good yields (81e93%), through a MgO NPs catalyzed reaction and their antibacterial activity evaluated, assessing the inhibition zone diameter (IZD), MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against five Gram-negative bacteria strains (P. aeruginosa PTCC 1310, E. coli PTCC 1399, Shigella dysenteriae PTCC 1188, P. mirabilis PTCC 1776 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica PTCC 1709) and three Grampositive bacteria strains (S. aureus PTCC 1189, Staphylococcus epidermidis PTCC 1435 and Rhodococcus equi PTCC 1633). The most promising results were attained by compounds 105 and 106, especially against P. mirabilis and S. epidermidis (Table 4), with MICs similar or slightly higher than the ones attained by positive control penicillin. Nonetheless, the compounds showed lower antibiotic activity towards all the strains tested when compared with the other positive control, gentamicin [113]. Their compliance with the main druglikeness rules falls short for these compounds, namely due to molecular weight and TPSA limitations. Furthermore, a prediction of low oral bioavailability for both compounds can also indicate pharmacokinetic issues later on in the development pipeline. Harichandran et al. explored the reactivity of isatins, activated methylenes and different 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, using amberlite IRA-400 Cl resin as heterogeneous catalyst and water as reaction medium (Scheme 29D).</p>
        <p>Six out of the sixteen compounds in this library of spirooxindole derivatives (21e98% yield) were then screened in vitro against four pathogenic bacterial strains (B. subtilis MTCC 441, S. aureus MTCC 96, E. coli MTCC 1689 and P. vulgaris MTCC 742). The most active compound, 107, was obtained using N-methyl-isatin, malononitrile and 4-hydroxynaphthalen-2(1H)-one as starting materials and present comparable antibacterial activity, or in some cases even higher than the positive control, tetracyclin (Scheme 30) [114]. This bioactive compound also displays a good predicted pharmacokinetic profile, as it complies with the five druglikeness rules and presents, theoretically, good oral bioavailability, making it a promising drug candidate.</p>
        <p>The triethylamine promoted three component reaction between isatins, activated methylenes and 3-cyanoacetyl indole (Scheme 29E) allowed the preparation of a library of spirooxindole derivatives bearing the indole moiety (12 examples, 72e89% yield). The antibacterial activity of these compounds was then accessed through the disc diffusion method, using S. aureus, S. epidermidis and B. subtilis as the targeted pathogenic bacteria. Compounds 108e110 presented antibacterial activity comparable to the one exhibited by the positive controls, gentamicin and chloramphenicol (Scheme 31) [115]. The three compounds exhibit a high degree of compliance with the five rules of druglikeness, except for compound 110, the most active, which exhibits one violation of the Ghose rule. The potential of these compounds is also highlighted by the prediction that they can cross the gastrointestinal barrier and therefore present good bioavailability when administered per os.</p>
        <p>Recently, Moradi et al. explored the synthesis of spirooxindole derivatives through the three-component reaction involving isatin, activated methylenes and dicarbonyl compounds (including dimedone, cyclohexanedione and barbituric acid derivatives), under environmentally friendly conditions, using SnO 2 NPs as heterogeneous catalyst and ethanol as solvent at room temperature (Scheme 29F and 29G). The reaction allowed the preparation of 15 derivatives in very good yields (80e96%) and five compounds out of these were screened against seven bacterial strains (S. aureus ATCC Scheme 20. Three-component 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition using chalcones as dipolarophiles (A and B); structure, MIC and cytotoxicity evaluation of the most active compounds (C and D). 29737, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, E. coli ATCC 10536, K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031, S. dysenteriae PTCC 1188, P. vulgaris PTCC 1182 and S. paratyphi-A ATCC 5702). The respective inhibition zones and MICs were evaluated, using tetracycline as positive control. However, the compounds were inactive against most bacterial strains, except for S. epidermidis, but the MIC was quite high for all the compounds (in the mg/mL range) [116].</p>
        <p>A different approach was attempted by Singh et al., exploring a one pot Knoevenagel/Michael addition/azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition reaction under ultrasonic irradiation using DBUbased ionic liquids as the reaction media (Scheme 32). The final derivatives (15 examples), bearing spirooxindole, 2-amino-4H-pyran and 1,2,3-triazole moieties, were obtained in excellent overall yields (88e94%). The antibacterial activity of these compounds was tested, first by determining the diameter of growth inhibition zone, where all the compounds proved to be ineffective towards Gramnegative bacteria (E. coli MTCC 1652 and P. aeruginosa MTCC 741), but some level of antibacterial activity was observed against two Gram-positive bacteria strains (S. aureus MTCC 96 and B. subtilis MTCC 121). The authors decided to further explore this selectivity towards Gram-positive bacteria, by determining the respective MICs and MBCs. The best results were achieved by compounds 111 (obtained via Scheme 32A) and 112 (obtained via Scheme 32B), although still less active than the positive control ciprofloxacin (Scheme 32C) [117]. Noteworthy was the use of 1,3-dimethyl barbituric acid in the preparation of compound 112, instead of dimedone (for compound 111), leads to a considerably less favorable druglike features for the molecules, namely due to molecular weight, number of H-bond donors/ acceptors and TPSA, which is further evidenced by the predicted non-gastrointestinal absorption. The presence of a p-bromophenyl moiety in the triazole seems to be relevant for the observed antibacterial activity, since the two more active compounds displayed this aromatic substituent.</p>
        <p>Soorki and co-workers explored the application of sulfonic acid functionalized SBA-15 nanoporous material (SBA-Pr-SO 3 H) to promote the synthesis of spirooxindoles in two different contexts. In the first example, a pseudo 3 component reaction involving isatin and two equivalents of pyrazolone was carried out (Scheme 33A). The reaction showed low scope (6 examples) but afforded the products in overall very good yields (80e93%). Their antibacterial activity was accessed in vitro against two Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 85327) and two Grampositive bacteria (S. aureus ATCC 25923 and B. subtilis ATCC 465). As in the previous example, all the compounds were ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria, and only two were active against B. subtilis. Antibacterial activity against S. aureus was observed for the six compounds, with the best MIC being achieved by compound 113, although still less effective than the positive controls; chloramphenicol and gentamicin (Scheme 33C) [118]. In the second example, the same heterogeneous catalyst was applied, this time in a three-component reaction involving isatin, pyrazolone and dimedone or 1,3-cyclohexanedione (Scheme 33B). The small library (8 examples) was attained in good yields (76e85%) and their antibacterial activity was determined against the same four bacteria strains. This time, three of the derivatives displayed weak activity against E. coli, but no activity against P. aeruginosa was observed. In the case of the Gram-positive bacteria, once again all the derivatives displayed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, and just half of them had activity against B. subtilis, including the lowest MIC of the screening for compound 115 (Scheme 33C) [119]. Despite the structural similarities between the most active compounds, it is noteworthy that replacing the second pyrazolone moiety in compound 113 by a 1,3-cyclohexanedione in compound 115 leads to a major change in druglikeness, mostly due to molecular weight and lipophilicity related issues. Furthermore, the three compounds listed in Scheme 33C are predicted to show high gastrointestinal permeation, with 115 even exhibiting features that would allow permeation through the BBB.</p>
        <p>Other spirooxindole derivatives were obtained using alternative synthetic methodologies and are summarized in Scheme 34. Soorki and co-workers explored the reaction between isatin, 1,3indandione and 2-naphthol to achieve five spironaphthopyrano [1,2b]indeno-7,3 0 -indolines (50e92% yield) under solvent and catalyst-free conditions (Scheme 34A). The in vitro activity against the same four bacteria described in the last example was evaluated, but the MICs achieved showed weak antibacterial activity (the best result was 128 mg/mL) [120]. Farhadi et al. used a NiCo 2 O 4 @Ni(BDC) (terephthalic acid) nanocatalyst to promote the reaction between isatin, 1,3-indandione and guanidine (3 examples; 93e98% yield -Scheme 34B) or (thio)urea (2 examples; 95e97% yield -Scheme 34C). These compounds were inactive against E. coli ATCC 25922 but most of them showed some inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 accessed with the disc diffusion method. The best results were achieved when 5-bromo and 5-chloro isatins were used with guanidine to afford the corresponding spirooxindole derivatives against S. aureus ATCC 25932, leading to a larger halo of inhibition (17 and 18 mm, versus 16 mm in the positive control ciprofloxacin). Unfortunately, no MICs were evaluated [121].</p>
        <p>A different approach reported by Soorki and co-workers consisted in the Alum-catalyzed three component reaction involving isatin, isatoic anhydride and phenyl hydrazine (Scheme 34D) to afford a library of 3'-(phenylamino)-1 0 H-spiro[indoline-3,2 0 -quinazoline]-2,4 0 (3 0 H)-dione derivatives (13 examples, 60e97% yield). The resulting compounds were then subjected to a thorough in vitro antibacterial screening against ten bacterial strains (B. subtilis ATCC 465, Bacillus pumilus PTCC 1114, M. luteus PTCC 1110, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Streptococcus mutans PTCC 1601, E. coli ATCC 25922, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29737, P. aeruginosa ATCC 85327, K. pneumoniae ATCC 29655). While five of these compounds were inactive in all the bacteria tested, compounds 116e119 proved to possess antibacterial activity higher or comparable to the positive controls (tetracyclin and gentamicin) (Scheme 34E). Remarkably, these four promising compounds comply with the five analyzed druglikeness rules and predictably exhibit good gastrointestinal absorption, making them good candidates to proceed in the drug discovery pipeline.</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that most oxindole-derivatives reported in the literature consisted of spirooxindoles, some relevant publications describe synthetic methodologies to afford non-spiro derivatives. The most recent examples concerning MCRs are summarized in Scheme 35.</p>
        <p>Rad-Moghadam and Azimi reported the synthesis of a library of oxindolylpyrrolo [2,3d]pyrimidine derivatives (16 examples) using a tandem three component reaction, which required pH variation to succeed (Scheme 35A). This efficient methodology allowed the preparation of the desired derivatives in very good to excellent yields (82e95%), which were then screened to verify their antibacterial potential. The selected bacterial strains consisted of two Gram-negative (E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 85327) and two Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis ATC465 and S. aureus ATCC 25923). The results showed that while several derivatives were inactive against E. coli, several of them (8 compounds) were more effective against P. aeruginosa than the positive control, norfloxacin. The vast majority of the compounds presented antibacterial activity against the two Gram-positive bacteria tested, however, for all the cases, the MIC values obtained were in the range of mg/mL [122].</p>
        <p>A rhodium(II)-catalyzed three component reaction was carried out by Lakshmi et al., via the reaction between isatin, 3diazooxindole and benzyl alcohols (Scheme 35B), affording bisoxindole derivatives (10 examples) in overall very good yields (82e90%). The antibacterial activity of these structurally interesting derivatives would be ideal candidates for further drug development studies.</p>
        <p>A very different approach to those previously mentioned was the one reported by Baharfar et al., using a pseudo-four component isocyanide-based reaction to prepare one compound bearing the isatin and 2,5-diaminofuran moieties. Unlike the previously reported compounds, in this case, the reaction is not promoted at the C3 position of the isatin core, as 2-(2,3-dioxoindolin-1-yl)acetic acid is used as starting material (Scheme 35C). The antibacterial activity of this compound against E. coli PTCC 1330, P. aeruginosa PTCC 1074, S. aureus ATCC 35923, and B. subtilis PTCC 1023 was accessed using the disk diffusion assay. However, the results showed that the compound exhibited, on average, two times less activity than the positive controls, which were gentamicin and chloramphenicol [124]. Evaluation of the druglike properties and pharmacokinetic profile also does not bode well for this compound, as it fails to comply with the five rules and exhibits a poor pharmacokinetic profile, with poor to no predicted gastrointestinal absorption.</p>
        <p>Less common is the application of isatin in MCRs to obtain nonoxindole derivatives. Among the recent reported examples, we highlight three different libraries which were screened against different bacteria (Scheme 37).</p>
        <p>Ashok et al. explored different activation techniques for the three-component reaction between isatin, aromatic ketones and ethanol, which played a dual role as both reagent and solvent (Scheme 37A). The reaction, catalyzed by sulfuric acid, allowed the preparation of the desired 2-(2-ethoxy-5-substituted-indol-3ylidene)-1-aryl-ethanones (19 examples) under conventional heating, ultrasound irradiation and microwave irradiation, with the last one allowing higher yields (86e92%) and short reaction times. The antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus was then evaluated, using the disc diffusion method at three different concentrations (25, 50 and 100 mg/mL). All the compounds showed some level of antibacterial activity, with compounds 123e125 proving to be the most effective, and gratifyling, at the lowest concentration they exhibited similar or higher activity than the positive control ampicillin (Scheme 38) [125]. The SwissADME analysis of the most active compounds showed that they display an overall good pharmacokinetic profile prediction, with the exception of compound 125, which failied to comply with the Muegge rule, due to a higher LogP than desirable, caused by the inclusion of an naphthyl moiety. Furthermore, the three compounds predictably exhibit good gastrointestinal absorption, as well as BBB permeation; making them good candidates for drug development.</p>
        <p>A library of spiro[indolo-3,10 0 -indeno[1,2-b]quinolin]-2,4,11 0trione derivatives (22 examples; 83e95% yield) was prepared via a three component reaction involving isatin, enaminones and 1,3indandione, catalyzed by ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) (Scheme 37B). The antibacterial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria strains (S. aureus MTCC 96 and B. subtilis MTCC 121) and two Grampositive bacteria strains (E. coli MTCC 1652 and P. aeruginosa MTCC 741) was evaluated, using the disk diffusion method and MIC determination. While all the derivatives exhibited some activity against E. coli and the Gram-positive strains, they could not inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa. The MIC values obtained showed that some compounds, and in particular 126, possesses good antibacterial activity, although weaker than the one displayed by the positive control ciprofloxacin (Table 5) [126]. Despite the ability of these compounds to cross the gastrointestinal barrier according to the predictive model, the compounds do not comply with all the druglike rules, and in particular with the Ghose rule, due to their molecular weight and poor lipophilicity.</p>
        <p>Recently, the same four bacterial strains were applied in the antibacterial evaluation of a library of spiro[acridine-9,3 0 -indole]-2 0 ,4,4 0 (1 0 H,5 0 H,10H)-trione derivatives (20 examples), synthesized via a pseudo four component reaction involving isatin, substituted anilines and dimedone (2 equivalents), using a sustainable methodology (Scheme 37C). Catalytic amounts of b-cyclodextrin (b-CD) allowed the preparation of the desired compounds (78e95% yield), using water as reaction medium, while the hydrophobic interior of the catalyst provided the formation of efficient host-guest complexes through a supramolecular catalytic system. The best results for the antibacterial screening are summarized in Scheme 39. Remarkably, while so far most of the compounds seemed to be selective towards Gram-positive bacteria, in the case of compounds 129 and 132 they display more activity against Gram-negative bacteria. On the other hand, in the case of B. subtilis the two compounds, 130 and 131, showed better results than their positive controls [127]. The substitution pattern of the aniline moiety not only plays a major role in the antibacterial activity, but also in the pharmacokinetic profile of these derivatives. The depicted bioavailability radar for compound 129, combined with its poor druglikeness, indicate that the presence of the tribromoaniline moiety leads to a substantial deterioration of the predicted pharmacokinetic profile, including the inability to permeate the gastrointestinal tract. The remaining four compounds are compliant with almost all the rules (except the Ghose rule due to their molecular weight ) and should be able to cross the gastrointestinal barrier, making them good orally delivered antibiotic candidates.</p>
        <p>Often overlooked by Health authorities and the scientific community, fungal infections present an unneglectable socio-economic burden nowadays. With an estimated mortality of more than 1.5 million worldwide, and an incidence of over one billion, fungal infections affect mostly immunosuppressed patients, a population which is continuously growing thanks to clinical and therapeutic Scheme 29. Knoevenagel/Michael addition based 3MCRs applied in the synthesis of isatin-based antibacterial agents.</p>
        <p>Most promising antibacterial results for compounds 105 and 106 and respective druglikeness rules compliance. advances [128,129]. The existent therapeutic arsenal is becoming powerless, with the emergence of drug resistance, as well as due to toxicity and side-effects. This leads to the need of further drug discovery and development efforts in the field of antifungal agents, supported by the better understanding of fungal pathogenesis and identification of new druggable targets[130e134].</p>
        <p>Several of the compounds described in the antibacterial activity section of this work were also evaluated for their antifungal activity. For this reason, in this section, no observation will be made on the synthetic routes to achieve these isatin-based MCRs products with promising antifungal activity, and focus will be given to their structures, bioactivity and pharmacokinetic/druglike features. Among the already described derivatives, some were tested against yeast strains, Aspergillus spp. and, less commonly Rhizopus spp. and Fusarium spp., but no or weak activity was observed (often the isatin-derived compounds were less active at least by two-fold when compared to the positive control). This was observed with some of the libraries already described in this review (Schemes 28A, 29A-C, 37BeC) and therefore no further details on their antifungal activity will be given.</p>
        <p>Among the opportunistic infections caused by fungi, we will start by highlighting the development of compounds targeting yeasts. These unicellular organisms can generate different clinical manifestations, from easy-to-treat mucocutaneous localized infections to more invasive and life-threatening conditions. Among the different yeast species, Candida spp. are the most common fungal infections detected in clinical practice, that can lead to candidemia, a possible deadly form of the infection characterized by the presence of yeast in the bloodstream. The worldwide distribution of Candida spp. in nosocomial infections leading to candidemia evolves with time and with the global region. While in the north of Europe (Iceland, Finland, Norway, Denmark) C. albicans is the most common candidemia agent (56e70%), followed by C. glabrata (13e21%), in the south of Europe (Spain), these percentages drop to 45% and 13% respectively. On the other hand, C. parapsilosis, which in the north of Europe corresponds to a small percentage of the cases (3.7e5.8%), in Spain can reach up to 25%. In the USA, the proportion of C. albicans is even lower (38%), with C. glabrata representing a large portion of the cases (29%). C. tropicalis and C. krusei have also been detected in several candidemia cases, although with lower incidence (up to 10% and 8% respectively) [135].</p>
        <p>With this epidemiological problem in mind, it would be expected that some research groups would focus their attention on the quest for new antifungal drug candidates for treating yeast infections displayed interesting antifungal activity, as summarized in Scheme 40A [102]. Despite their predictable gastrointestinal absorption, as indicated by the bioavailability radar and druglikeness compliance, the molecular weight, as well as the predicted lipophilicity for these derivatives indicate their poor druggability. Singh et al. verified the antifungal activity of their derivatives (see Scheme 32A) against C. albicans (MTCC 227) and also against Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MTCC 170), a less common pathogen in clinical practice, but which can also lead to invasive fungal infections. Two derivatives, 137 and 138, displayed interesting antifungal activity against this species of yeast, proving to be more active than the positive control amphotericin-B [117]. Despite the structural resemblance between the two compounds, SwissADME predicts no gastrointestinal absorption for compound 137, while 138 presents a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile (Scheme 40B).</p>
        <p>Other common manifestation of fungal infections are the ones caused by mold and among these, Aspergillus spp. play a major etiological role. The clinical symptoms can range from simple infections to more life-threatening conditions, usually involving complications in the respiratory system and highly dependent on the subjects immune system status [136,137]. For these reasons, authors often include an Aspergillus spp. in their antibiotic screening procedure. For example, the already described druglike compounds 108 and 109 were evaluated against A. niger and led to a zone of inhibition similar to the one observed for the positive control, nystatin (28 and 27 mm, respectively, versus 28 mm) [115]. The compounds prepared by Sapnakumari et al. e which were already described in this work (see Scheme 20A) for their excellent antitubercular activity -were also evaluated against A. niger and A. flavus, with several of these derivatives displaying antifungal activity similar to the positive control, fluconazole (Scheme 41) [93]. Despite good oral bioavailability for the five derivatives depicted in Scheme 41, only 139 was compliant with the main druglikeness rules, as shown in the bioavailability radar.</p>
        <p>Several research groups chose to make a wider screening of antibiotic activity, which also included unicellular and pluricellular fungi as their target microbes. For example, compound 91, already described for its relevant antibacterial activity, was also evaluated against three different fungal strains e Malassezia pachydermatis (a yeast which rarely infects humans, but with some prevalence in veterinary fungal infections), C. albicans MTCC 227, and Botrytis cinerea (a necrotrophic fungus which can, in predisposed individuals, lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis after inhalation of the mold). Compound 91 exhibited similar activity against M. pachydermatis (MIC ¼ 15.62 mg/mL) with fluconazole (12.5 mg/ mL) and ketoconazole (15 mg/mL) as the positive controls. Against C. albicans, the result was also promising (31.25 mg/mL versus 25 mg/ mL for ketoconazole and &gt;100 mg/mL for fluconazole) [105].</p>
        <p>Other examples of spirooxindole derivatives already described in this work that were subjected to antifungal activity screening were compounds 98e103. The selected fungi were Aspergillus fumigatus RCMB 02568, Syncephalastrum racemosum RCMB 05922 (a filamentous fungus, which can rarely lead to complications designated mucormycosis, an opportunistic infection), Geotrichum candidum RCMB 05097 (although part of the human microbiome, this fungus can cause geotrichosis, which can affect different organs) and Candida albicans RCMB 05036. The antifungal activity of these compounds is summarized in Scheme 42 [108,109]. In the case of compounds 102 and 103, docking studies of the compounds with the well-established antifungal target, lanosterol 14a-demethylase, showed that compound 102 established four hydrogen bonds with the enzyme, while compound 103 only established one. This might explain the higher antifungal activity displayed by compound 102 [109].</p>
        <p>Among the examples of isatin-based MCRs derived from nonoxindole derivatives, only the library reported by Ashok et al. (see Scheme 37A) was tested against two strains of fungus e A. niger and Candida metapsilosis. Using the disc diffusion assay, at concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 mg/mL, several compounds exhibited good antifungal activity. The best results are summarized in Scheme 43 (at concentration of 25 mg/mL). Noteworthy, the compounds exhibiting higher antifungal activity were not the same as those that displayed higher antibacterial activity, indicating selectivity within the same family of compounds [125]. All the compounds predictably possess good pharmacokinetic profiles, complemented with good gastrointestinal absorption, and comply with the five druglikeness rules. These predictions, combined with the synthetic accessibility and selectivity towards fungal species versus bacterial strains, makes these compounds an excellent starting point for new antifungal drug candidate development.</p>
        <p>Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by several species of the genus Leishmania, with two main clinical manifestations, designated visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. It is classified by the WHO as a neglected tropical disease and despite some therapeutic options available, the diversity of infectious species and host symptoms makes the discovery of new drug candidates an urgent priority [138,139].</p>
        <p>In the recent literature, only one example of isatin-based MCRs explores the antileishmanial activity of the synthesized products, although multiple examples can be found of oxindole-based antileishmanial active compounds [140,141]. Lotfy et al. explored a 3-MCR involving isatin, cyclohexanone-based chalcones and L-pro- line or thioproline (Scheme 44A). The resulting library (17 examples, up to 96% yield) was evaluated in vitro against Leishmania major promastigotes, with compound 147 displaying relevant antileishmanial activity (IC 50 ¼ 6.8 ± 0.54 mM), even when compared with positive control drugs amphotericin B (0.49 ± 0.03 mM) and pentamidine (5.22 ± 0.70 mM) (Scheme 44B).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, this same compound also exhibited more antiproliferative activity against HeLa cell line (IC 50 ¼ 4.8 ± 0.1 mM, versus the positive control doxorubicin, IC 50 ¼ 1.2 ± 0.4 mM).</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, this compound also exhibited high cytotoxicity against a normal mouse fibroblast cell line 3T3</p>
        <p>(IC 50 ¼ 19.1 ± 2.6 mM, versus the positive control cycloheximide, IC 50 ¼ 0.3 ± 0.02 mM) [142]. Furthermore, the compound presents poor compliance with the five druglikeness rules, as well as poor GI absorption, making it a poor drug candidate, especially for oral administration.</p>
        <p>The quest for new antiviral agents is also the main focus area of several research groups working in drug discovery, and several oxindole-based molecules show promising antiviral activity. The antiviral importance of oxindole-bearing compounds dates back to the last century, as methisazone (Marboran®) was applied as a prophylaxis treatment for smallpox infection, until the discovery of a vaccine and implementation of successful vaccination programs which led to its eradication in 1980 [143,144].</p>
        <p>Recently, Zhang et al. explored the [3þ2]-cycloaddition 3-MCR to prepare a library of dispiroheterocycles from isatins, aurones and D-proline (14 examples e 45e83% yield), sarcosine (11 examples e 35e72% yield) or (R)-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (5 examples e 61e78% yield) (Scheme 45A). The antiviral activity of these compounds was evaluated against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Scheme 45B). Compound 149 displayed similar antiviral activity to the commercially available natural compound ningnanmycin [145], which can induce tobacco plant defense mechanisms against TMV [146]. This shows the potential of MCR-obtained oxindole derivatives as potent agrochemicals. Furthermore, the fact that this molecule follows most of the already mentioned druglikeness rules (except the Ghose filter), with good oral bioavailability and even BBB passage, makes these chemical frameworks an interesting starting point for further antiviral activity evaluation, including human-infecting viruses.</p>
        <p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the therapeutic classes most used worldwide. Used in clinical practice for pain relief and to ameliorate the pro-inflammatory processes associated with several pathologies, they constitute a very important drug class. Moreover, some oxindole derivatives have emerged as potential NSAID lead candidates [147].</p>
        <p>The already described library of spirooxindoles prepared by Lofty et al. (see Scheme 44A) was evaluated in the oxidative burst assay to evaluate their anti-inflammatory properties using ibuprofen as the positive control. Gratifyingly, while four out of the seventeen compounds were inactive, eight exhibited antiinflammatory activity higher than ibuprofen. The best results are summarized in Scheme 46. Docking studies with the most active Scheme 34. Synthesis of spirooxindole derivatives with potential antibacterial activity (AeD). Most promising results of the antibacterial screening (E) (ND ¼ not determined). compounds and cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2), identified this as a possible target for these molecules, as they possess multiple interaction points, via hydrogen and halogen bonds, as well as hydrophobic and p-cation interactions [142]. In the case of the druglike features of these molecules, it is noteworthy that several are non-compliant with most of the rules, mostly due to their molecular weight and predicted lipophilicity. For example, molecules 151, 156 and 158 present low gastrointestinal absorption and therefore might present a poor pharmacokinetic profile or require alternative formulations and/or administration routes. Both compounds 152 and 157 showed good predicted bioavailabilities (see the radar, Scheme 46), but of the most active compounds (IC 50 &lt; 5 mM), only compound 157 was compliant with four out of the five druglikeness rules, thus making it the best candidate for drug development.</p>
        <p>The antioxidant activity was determined for compound 32 (see Scheme 12B) using the 2,2 0 -azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay and the bleomycin-dependent DNA damage test. In the first assay, this oxindole-thiadiazole hybrid displayed moderate antioxidant activity (48.13% inhibition, with IC 50 ¼ 1048 mg/mL) when compared with the positive control, ascorbic acid (88.55% inhibition, IC 50 ¼ 544.1 mg/mL). In the DNA [79].</p>
        <p>The DPPH radical scavenging assay was also applied by Sapnakumari et al. to evaluate the potential antioxidant activity of the library of spirooxindoles already mentioned in this work (see Scheme 20A and 20C). At concentrations of 1 mg/mL, three compounds (159, 160 and 72) exhibited slightly lower activity than the standard, glutathione (Table 6) [93]. Another library already addressed in this work (see Scheme 29C) was also subjected to the DPPH scavenging assay and the results compared to ascorbic acid. Nevertheless, the activities presented by the spirooxindoles were moderate, with ascorbic acid exhibiting almost twice the antioxidant activity, with IC 50 s in the range 12.19 and 14.32 mg/mL, with ascorbic acid displaying an IC 50 of 3.94 mg/mL [113].</p>
        <p>A sustainable methodology, involving a (±)-camphor-10sulfonic acid (CSA)-catalyzed three component reaction between isatin, 5-amino-3-methylisoxazole and b-diketones using ultrasound activation was recently reported (Scheme 47). A small library (4 examples) was obtained with short reaction times and very good yields (76e90%). The antioxidant activity of these compounds was evaluated, using the DPPH radical scavenging assay, metal chelating activity and reducing power. Unfortunately, the results were poorer than those obtained with the reference compounds [148].</p>
        <p>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most challenging diseases for modern societies, with the global number of people living with AD or other types of dementia increasing by two-fold between 1990 and 2016. The main causes for this growth are related to the growth and ageing of the world population. The burden of this disease is therefore quite high and the socioeconomic impact, as well as the healthcare implications, troublesome [149]. The complex pathophysiology of AD leads to the identification of several possible therapeutic targets and many research groups and pharmaceutical industries have devoted their resources to finding possible solutions, despite the number of studies that have been carried out to date, much progress is still required principally in the amyloid-targeting field [150]. In the current therapeutic landscape, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) e donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine e are prescribed for treating the symptoms only, however limitations in their tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetic profiles still justify the quest for new and safer therapeutic options [151].</p>
        <p>Several oxindole derivatives already have displayed both cholinesterase inhibition and neuroprotection, making the oxindole unit a very relevant scaffold to be explored in this field We then predicted the druglikeness and pharmacokinetic profiles of this molecule. The oral bioavailability radar depicted in Scheme 48C, indicates that the physical-chemical properties of compound 163 are not within the requirements for good oral bioavailability, but the proximity to the colored area might indicate that fine tuning of structural features might lead to a more druglike molecule.</p>
        <p>Hasaninejad and co-workers developed a library of spirooxindole-dihydropyridine derivatives (16 examples) in good yields (67e79%), via a 3-MCR involving isatins, malononitrile and N,N 0 -substituted-2-nitroethene-1,1-diamines, using PEG-400 as a sustainable and biodegradable reaction medium (Scheme 49A). The in vitro cholinesterase activity was measured using the previously mentioned DTNB assay using, once again, galantamine as positive control. Four compounds displayed an AChE enzyme inhibition activity lower than 1.1 mM (see Scheme 49B), with compound 167 displaying higher activity than galantamine, with high selectivity towards AChE when compared to BChE (35.024) [156]. Intrigued with these results, as was carried out for compound 163, we decided to perform the usual in silico simulations for this promising molecule. We found that the oral bioavailability radar presented a better score than compound 163, indicating a higher likelihood of compound 167 to be administered per os (Scheme 49C).</p>
        <p>We decided to further explore the pharmacokinetic properties of these eight compounds with higher in vitro AChE inhibition activity and compare them with galantamine (Table 7). While the commercialized drug displays a linear pharmacokinetic profile, with about 90% bioavailability after oral administration and easily crosses the BBB [157] (in accordance to the SwissADME simulation), the most active oxindole derivatives 163 and 167 present low gastrointestinal absorption. Furthermore, none of these new AChE inhibitors seem to be able to cross the BBB, which constitutes a great drawback, as they are unable to reach their physiological target, as clearly shown in the Boiled-egg model (Fig. 5). This is a major red flag, as many AD drug candidates fail to evolve in the drug development pipeline and even clinical trials due to pharmacokinetic attrition, which is due in many cases to poor or no BBB permeation [158,159]. Regarding the druglikeness of these compounds, the physico-chemical properties prediction dictates that most of them are compliant with three out of the five rules evaluated, whilst galantamine satisfies all five rules.</p>
        <p>Another neurodegenerative disease with a massive socioeconomic impact is Parkinson's disease (PD), with its global burden more than doubling over the past generation, caused mostly by the same demographic shift as reported for AD [160,161]. Characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, most of the current therapeutic options are focused on preserving dopamine levels in the brain, by administration of levodopa (dopamine precursor), or catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, since COMT is responsible for the degradation of dopamine (e.g.</p>
        <p>Pharmacokinetics and druglikeness compliance of isatin-derived MCR adducts with cholinesterase inhibition activity as compared with galantamine (G). tolcapone and entacapone), or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, which also breaks down dopamine in the basal ganglia, or dopamine agonists (such as ropinirol, which is an oxindole based drug). Other therapeutic options are mostly focused on the treatment of symptoms. The main problem as for AD is that there is no cure for this disease, and the prescribed medicines often only delay the symptoms for a certain amount of time, and thus new targets are required [162,163]. In this context, the NAD þ -dependent protein lysine deacylases that constitute the sirtuin family, appears as a possible target for several age-related diseases, including PD. There are seven human sirtuins described, with a multitude of physiological functions, which determines their potential as targets for multiple diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders [164,165]. For the last one, and for PD in particular, sirtuin 2 is the most relevant member of this family, since its age-related levels increment can mediate several routes of the PD pathogenesis, from a-synuclein aggregation, microtubule function, oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy and even a possible connection with dopaminergic neurons death [166].</p>
        <p>Hasaninejad and co-workers prepared a library of spirooxindole derivatives (25 examples) in excellent yields (84e98%), through a DABCO-catalyzed 3-MCR (Scheme 50A). Docking studies were then performed, in order to evaluate the affinity values of the spirooxindole derivatives with the target sirtuin 2. Out of the twenty-five derivatives, the three compounds (169e171) displaying a greater affinity were selected to proceed to in vitro studies, using a highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based methodology, using fluorogenic histone deacetylase substrate MAL to determine the inhibitory activity, and using sirtinol as positive control. The three compounds exhibited lower activity when compared to sirtinol, by almost two-fold, with compound 169 being slightly more active than the other two (Scheme 50B) [167].</p>
        <p>The oral bioavailability radar for compound 169 is depicted in Scheme 51A, and despite the unsaturated nature of the molecule, all the other parameters fit within the colored area, showing the potential of this compound for an oral administration route. This is further confirmed in the Boiled-Egg model (Scheme 51B), with the three described compounds exhibiting high gastrointestinal absorption. Compliance with the main druglikeness rules is also verified with this predictive model, but the main drawback is, once again, the lack of BBB permeation, and therefore inability to reach the therapeutic target (Scheme 51C). Drug delivery systems to enable BBB permeation, or evaluation of these compounds against different sirtuin subtypes and pathophysiological processes might be a suitable approach for further development of these druglike molecules.</p>
        <p>MCRs are a valuable synthetic approach to obtain new druglike oxindole derivatives in a time-efficient and often eco-friendly manner. In this review, we have discussed the most recent developments in isatin-based MCRs and their respective biological activities. The emergence of new tools, such as SwissADME, allows researchers to perform an early screening of their hit compounds, predicting their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, thus enabling them to determine if they are potential drug candidates or not. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that phenotypic assays constitute the most common approach for biological activity screening of new oxindole derivatives obtained via MCRs, contrary to target-based screening. This is mostly due to the wide scaffold diversity obtained using MCRs and to the privileged status of the oxindole core as an important general pharmacophore. From the examples given in this review, we realize that MCRs are therefore a precious tool to increase the output of new druglike molecules, allowing faster hit identification, as well as, hit-to-lead optimization in a variety of pathologies.</p>
