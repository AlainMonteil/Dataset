        <p>Currently, the most powerful approach to monitor organic micropollutants (OMPs) in environmental samples is the combination of target, suspect and non-target screening strategies using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). However, the high complexity of sample matrices as well as the huge number of OMPs potentially present in samples at low concentrations pose an analytical challenge. Ion mobility separation (IMS) combined with HRMS instruments (IMS-HRMS) introduces an additional analytical dimension, providing extra information which facilitates the identification of OMPs. The collision cross section (CCS) value provided by IMS is unaffected by the matrix or chromatographic separation. Consequently, the creation of CCS databases and the inclusion of ion mobility within identification criteria are of high interest for an enhanced and robust screening strategy. In this work, a CCS library for IMS-HRMS, which is online and freely available, was developed for 556 OMPs in both positive and negative ionization modes using electrospray ionization. The inclusion of ion mobility data in widely adopted confidence levels for identification in environmental reporting is discussed. Illustrative examples of OMPs found in environmental samples are presented to highlight the potential of IMS-HRMS and to demonstrate the additional value of CCS data in various screening strategies.</p>
        <p>High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) offers a powerful and suitable alternative to former targeted screening methods using low resolution mass spectrometry [1][2][3][4][5] . The high mass accuracy and resolution, together with the extensive variety of available acquisition modes for a wide mass-to-charge range (m/z 50-1000), make HRMS the technique of choice for wide-scope screening of thousands of organic micropollutants (OMPs) and their transformation products in aquatic matrices such as surface water or wastewater [6][7][8][9] .</p>
        <p>Hybrid HRMS mass analyzers, such as quadrupole -time-of-flight (QTOF), offer the possibility of sequentially acquiring information about the ionized molecule and fragment ions which vastly increases the identification potential of the screening strategy without significantly compromising the sensitivity of the analysis. However, when data independent acquisition (DIA) modes are used, fragmentation occurs not only for the compound of interest but for other co-eluting compounds and, therefore, fragments of multiple precursor ions can contribute to the fragmentation spectrum 6 .</p>
        <p>Particularly in complex matrices, interferences may be present due to fragment ions from precursors other than the one of interest. As a result, the possibility of misidentification increases. The large amount of data generated, the extensive databases used as well as the untargeted acquisition mode require meticulous strategies for the identification of compounds in the results obtained. The use of retention time and mass accuracy tolerance alone during screening analyses can lead to a notable number of false-positive findings 10,11 . To address this, different identification levels have been proposed in the scientific literature that depend on the information obtained by HRMS analysis [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] .</p>
        <p>The 5-level classification, from the most confident scenario (level 1, confirmed structure by reference standard) to the most uncertain scenario (level 5, exact mass of interest) proposed by Schymanski et al. 13 is currently widely used in the environmental literature. While discussions are ongoing for a revised set of identification levels, especially in the metabolomics community, these have not yet achieved community consensus.</p>
        <p>The coupling of ion mobility separation (IMS) to HRMS instruments (IMS-HRMS) has promising applications for both targeted and untargeted screening. Briefly, IMS separates ions depending on their size, shape and charge in a gas phase, usually nitrogen (N2) or helium (He), in the presence of an electric field 19 . Owing to their different mobility through the drift cell, IMS enables, in theory, the separation of isobaric or isomeric compounds that could not be previously resolved using liquid chromatography (LC) and/or HRMS 6,[19][20][21] . The time needed by an ion to travel through the mobility separation device, the drift time (DT), is used for the determination of the collision cross section (CCS) of this particular ion based on the measurement of calibrating standards with already established CCS values for travelling wave IMS (TWIMS) or trapped IMS (TIMS) instruments, or based on the application of Mason-Schamp equation for drift tube IMS (DTIMS) instruments 22 . While measured DT is not comparable between different instruments 19 , CCS is an instrument independent value that allows the comparison of CCS libraries with the actual measurement of a candidate in a sample even between different commercially available IMS-HRMS instruments 23 . In light of this, some publications dealing with the creation or use of CCS libraries for hundreds of compounds of different families have been published [24][25][26][27][28][29] . However, only very few studies have considered the inclusion of ion mobility data into the identification criteria 6,[30][31][32][33][34][35][36] . Nuñez et al. 30 present an automated scoring engine for the processing of IMS-HRMS data by comparing empirical mass spectrometric and ion mobility data with in silico libraries. However, neither the chromatographic separation nor mass fragmentation was considered, which may increase the occurrence of false positives. The study conducted by Monge et al. 31 proposes a scoring system for the identification of metabolites in untargeted metabolomics as an update for previously reported confidence levels of Sumner et al. 18 through the combination of chromatography, mass spectrometry, ion mobility separation and nuclear magnetic resonance.</p>
        <p>However, these publications did not establish the minimum requirements for compound identification.</p>
        <p>The aim of this work was: i) to develop an extensive database of CCS values for hundreds of OMPs in both positive and negative ionization mode, ii) to incorporate ion mobility information into a widely community-adopted confidence levels for non-target and suspect screening strategies, and iii) to demonstrate the improved utility of IMS-HRMS in screening of OMP in environmental samples via illustrative examples gathered in different research projects. The information provided in this work will be of interest in the near future, as it is expected that ion mobility will be incorporated as a complementary criterion for reliable identification in different areas of analytical research.</p>
        <p>A total of 556 reference standards comprising illicit drugs, hormones, mycotoxins, new psychoactive substances, pesticides and pharmaceuticals were injected for the development of a CCS library and the subsequent application of the library to screening analyses. Table S1 of the Supporting Information shows the complete set of compounds used in the study with their SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry system) representation, structure and measured CCS data. The database is also available on the NORMAN Suspect List Exchange website 37 , the Zenodo online repository 38 and the CCS values have been integrated into PubChem 39 .

        </p>
        <p>Analyses were performed with a Waters Acquity I-Class UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) connected to a VION IMS-QTOF mass spectrometer, using an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface operating in both positive and negative ionization mode.</p>
        <p>The chromatographic column used was a CORTECS® C18 2.1 x 100 mm, 2.7 µm fused core column (Waters) at a flow rate of 300 μL min -1 . Gradient elution was performed using H2O (A) and MeOH (B) as mobile phases, both with 0.01% formic acid. The initial percentage of B was 10%, which was immediately linearly increased to 90% over 14 min, followed by a 2 min isocratic period, then returned to initial conditions (at 16.1 min) with a 2 min equilibration of the column. The total run time was 18 min. The injection volume was 5 µL.</p>
        <p>A capillary voltage of 0.8 kV and cone voltage of 40 V were used. The desolvation temperature was set to 550 °C, and the source temperature to 120 °C. Nitrogen was used as the drying gas and nebulizing gas. The cone gas flow was 250 L h -1 and desolvation gas flow of 1000 L h -1 . The column temperature was set to 40 °C and the sample temperature to 10 °C. MS data were acquired using the VION in HDMSe mode, over the range m/z 50-1000, with N2 as the drift gas, an IMS wave velocity of 250 m s -1 and wave height ramp of 20-50 V. Leucine enkephalin (m/z 556.27658 and m/z 554.26202) was used for mass correction in positive and negative ionization modes, respectively. Two independent scans with different collision energies were acquired during the run: a collision energy of 6 eV for low energy (LE) and a ramp of 28-56 eV for high energy (HE). A scan time of 0.3 s was set in both LE and HE functions. Nitrogen (≥ 99.999%) was used as collision-induced dissociation (CID) gas.</p>
        <p>All data were examined using an in-house built accurate mass screening workflow within the UNIFI platform (version 1.8.2) from Waters Corporation.</p>
        <p>The whole set of reference standards was divided into different mixtures of up to 20 compounds depending on substances classes, based on previous knowledge about chromatographic separation and avoiding the presence of isobaric and isomeric compounds in the same mixture.</p>
        <p>To obtain an accurate CCS value for each compound, the following workflow was used. Prior to the standard injection, the instrument was calibrated both for m/z measurements and CCS calculation following the manufacturer instructions. Then a 'system suitability test' (SST) containing 9 compounds was injected ten times to check the accuracy of the instrument measurements. Table S2 shows the compounds included in the SST mix together with their molecular formula, SMILES and expected m/z and CCS value. Expected CCS values were provided by manufacturer: data measurements were performed in triplicate at three different pressures of N2 with a minimum of eight different voltage gradients (RSD were typically &lt; 0.3%) using a modified Synapt G2-Si (linear drift tube in place of the standard Travelling Wave cell). Next, in this study, reference standard mixtures at 1, 10 and 100 μg L -1 were injected in triplicates. After every mixture sequence (i.e. all injections of the three concentration levels per mix), an SST injection was performed for a temporal evolution and the continuous control of the stability of the measurement. At the end of the sequence, the SST was run again (n=10). For the data to be considered acceptable, mass accuracy and CCS error (percentage deviation from the expected value) for the start, end and interspersed SST injections had to be within an acceptable tolerance (5 ppm in mass accuracy and 2% deviation in CCS). Figure S1 shows the temporal evolution of mass and CCS accuracy across a representative injection run of standards during the CCS library building with interspersed SST in positive ionization mode. As expected, the empirical CCS deviation was below ± 2% deviation (mostly &lt; 1%) ensuring a good robustness of CCS measurement.</p>
        <p>The actual value of CCS for a compound was established by averaging the 9 values obtained at the three concentrations tested. In the cases where no signal was observed in the lower concentration level, the CCS value was established by averaging the data for the other concentration levels.</p>
        <p>A library containing CCS information of a total of 970 different adducts corresponding to 556 compounds (209 pesticides, 170 pharmaceuticals, 128 illicit drugs and new psychoactive substances, and 49 hormones and mycotoxins) was built to enhance target workflows with IMS. The library S1 of the Supporting Information and also publicly available on the NORMAN Suspect List Exchange website 37 , Zenodo online repository 38 and on PubChem 39 .</p>
        <p>As previously mentioned, the CCS for each adduct was obtained as an average value of the replicates injected at 3 different concentration levels. In general, the relative standard deviation (RSD) observed between replicates was 0.1-0.3%., and no trend was observed in the CCS measurement precision depending on the concentration of the reference standard. As an example of the main trend, Figure S2 shows the RSD in the measurement of CCS value for a set of 46 pesticides. The robustness of CCS measurements across injections supports the use of ion mobility as a powerful and promising tool for improved identification of candidates.</p>
        <p>In general, the CCS value of a certain adduct is strongly related to the molecular mass, such that different adducts of the same molecule generally result in different CCS values due to the difference (mainly in size) of the ion incorporated in or removed from the structure 41 (Figure S3).</p>
        <p>highlights that CCS values are also affected by other molecular parameters, such as the chemical backbone, ionization site or how the molecule can rearrange its structure to stabilize the electric charge. This is particularly the case of X-ray agents ioversol, iopromide, iomeprol and iopamidol that with a molecular mass of approximately 800 Da yield an unexpected low CCS value due to the intrinsic characteristics of the chemical backbone and substituents (Figure S4). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that among the complete set of 556 reference standards analyzed, only protomers were observed for the quinolone antibiotics sarafloxacin (I: 187.09 Å 2 and II: 202.00 Å 2 ), ciprofloxacin (I: 175.38 Å 2 and II: 188.89 Å 2 ) and norfloxacin (I: 171.88 Å 2 and II: 187.60 Å 2 ). In these particular cases, protonation on the cyclic ketone or the piperazine moiety 21 (Figure S5) resulted in different conformational changes, being distinct enough to be resolved by IMS. Consequently, these protomers could be qualitatively identified in real samples using IMS-HRMS without the need to consider abundances within the identification strategy.</p>
        <p>A detailed and comprehensive discussion concerning the general trends observed for CCS values as well as these particular cases can be found in the Supporting Information (Section S1 and</p>
        <p>Having well-defined criteria accepted by the scientific community for the identification of candidates in screening strategies is pivotal for an accurate dissemination of results and comparison with other studies. For that purpose, Schymanski et al. 13 proposed a 5-level criteria for the identification of small molecules using chromatographic separation coupled to HRMS. This classification also included cases in which the solely available information was the molecular formula or exact mass (level 4 -unequivocal molecular formula-and level 5 -exact mass of interest-, respectively). At these levels, insufficient information is available to propose tentative candidates.</p>
        <p>However, the data available for level 3 -tentative candidate(s)-allows the proposition of more than one chemical structure (for example, positional isomers). Candidate structures elucidated by in silico fragmentation tools are usually most appropriately classified as level 3 features. Level 2 -probable structure-is related to candidates that could unambiguously be assigned to a certain chemical structure based on the scientific literature, mass spectral libraries or diagnostic evidence. Finally, level 1 -confirmed structure-represents the ideal situation where chromatographic and mass spectrometric evidence are confirmed with a reference standard. These criteria have been widely adopted by environmental researchers 3,[42][43][44] . Even though the fragmentation information gathered with HRMS instruments often determines the potential for identification of candidates, the utilization of additional orthogonal methods is recommended 13,45 . In this sense, the incorporation of IMS-HRMS in screening strategies permits to gain even more confidence in the identification and adds an extra dimension to further improve screening analyses 46 . The inclusion of IMS may also help to discriminate between isomeric level 3 candidates and move one of them up to level 2. In this work, recommendations are given how to apply the 5-level criteria from Schymanski et al. 13 for users of state-of-the-art IMS-HRMS instruments. The analytical experience gathered during CCS library building has been taken into account in proposing these criteria. The classification is intended to enhance these widely adopted criteria and suggest how to apply them to IMS-HRMS measurements, as well as to contribute to the community discussion on how to incorporate multiple lines of evidence into identification confidence schemes.</p>
        <p>Figure 1 shows the different levels of confidence proposed in this work for the identification of a compound using LC-IMS-HRMS based on chromatographic, ion mobility and mass spectrometric parameters. Typically, the accuracy of empirical data for mass spectrometric measurements is established at a maximum deviation of 5 ppm (or 2 mDa) from the theoretical m/z, as well as compliance with the expected isotopic pattern 45 . However, as most HRMS instruments can provide higher levels of accuracy, the threshold for deviation in mass spectrometric measurements could nowadays be adjusted to 3 ppm. The criterion for retention time is less harmonized among the scientific community, and it is surely more debatable. In this work, a maximum retention time deviation of ± 0.1 min from that of the standard is proposed in agreement with SANTE 2017 guideline 45 , implying that both sample and reference standard are run under the same chromatographic conditions. However, the SANTE guideline is applied for food analysis and not environmental analysis.</p>
        <p>As such, the maximum deviation is an indicative value, and should be adapted depending on the particular conditions of the analysis. The results obtained and the examples presented in this study may open the dialogue to develop more applicable criteria for environmental studies, where matrix effects can potentially lead to high deviations. In the case of CCS, there are no regulatory guidelines yet and, therefore, there is still no agreement on which is the maximum threshold permitted for CCS deviation. Based on the experience gathered during the development of the CCS library included in this study, together with the background knowledge acquired during screening campaigns using IMS-HRMS, we propose a maximum deviation of 2% for CCS values. Depending on the availability of reference standards, in addition to the accuracy of the acquired empirical data, the level classification previously proposed by Schymanski et al. 13 is updated for IMS-HRMS users as follows:</p>
        <p> Level 5 -exact mass of interest-represents the level where least information about the candidate is available. However, the exact mass together with its specific CCS value is considered relevant for the study and worth being monitored in future campaigns.</p>
        <p> Level 4 -unequivocal molecular formula-encompasses the cases where a molecular formula can be assigned. MS, RT and CCS information alone, without fragmentation information, is commonly not enough to propose a potential structure and, therefore, RT and CCS data measured typically do not provide sufficient additional information for identification.</p>
        <p> Level 3 -tentative candidate(s)-comprises the cases where different chemical structures are compatible with the empirical RT, CCS and MS data but not enough information is available to distinguish which one is the most likely. In these cases, empirical information about the chromatography, ion mobility and mass spectrometry behavior of the candidates could be compared with predicted parameters. The predictions about the value for RT, CCS or mass fragmentation can give extra confidence to the proposed tentative candidates [47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54] , or help prioritize potential candidates 46 . Despite the additional value of such tools, the predicted values should be considered as an orientation. Hence, rejecting candidate structures solely because of a disagreement between empirical and predicted values is not recommended. The utilization of retention time indexing strategies (RTI) to compare the empirical data with online available databases can also provide extra confidence in the tentative identification of candidates 11,55 .</p>
        <p> Level 2 -probable structure-indicates that an exact structure could be proposed based on experimental evidence. This level can be divided into two sub-levels. Level 2a -probable structure by library match, comprises those cases when the structure of the compound is proposed based on the agreement between experimental data and literature or available libraries for both HRMS and CCS. The high robustness of CCS measurement between different instruments permits the utilization of home-made or third-party CCS libraries to compare with experimental data, reaching a high level of confidence in the identification. Level 2b -probable structure by diagnostic evidence-makes use of the available data to unambiguously propose a structure in the case that no other candidate fits the empirical evidence. The slender difference between level 2b and level 3 is the fact that in level 2b only one structure satisfies the experimental evidence (and all other candidates can be eliminated), while in level 3 there is not enough evidence to distinguish between more than one candidate structures. Level 2b identifications are generally quite rare and often require experimental context (e.g. transformation experiments where the parent is known). For both level 2a and 2b, a reference standard is required for a final confirmation of the structure to achieve the highest confidence (Level 1).</p>
        <p> Level 1 -confirmed structure-is the ideal situation, where the empirical data fully agrees with that of a reference standard in terms of MS, fragmentation, retention time and CCS. This is the case where the highest confidence in the identification is obtained with HRMS. For a proper level 1 identification, all orthogonal techniques (MS, fragmentation, RT and CCS) should be in accordance with that of the reference standard. However, the comparison of reference standard information to empirical data from samples can result in different sublevels of identification confidence. Hence, the combined adoption of an Identification Points (IP) scoring system to address this often challenging task is proposed in agreement with the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC 56 and recently reported IP proposals 42,57 . Briefly: Empirical MS information matches the reference standard 1 IP Empirical RT information matches the reference standard 1 IP Empirical CCS information matches the reference standard 1.5 IP Two or more matching HRMS fragments 2.5 IP</p>
        <p>Although the ideal situation should yield a maximum of 6 IP (1 for MS, 1 for RT, 2.5 for HRMS fragmentation and 1.5 for CCS), a minimum value of 5 IP should be considered sufficient for the confirmation of the identity. While some studies have proposed different criteria for the identification of compounds 13,42,45,56,57 , very few consider the likely case in which any of the parameters measured (retention time, CCS or mass spectrometric data) fails to meet the requirements. In such cases, establishing the level of confidence of the identification is not a straightforward decision and usually further investigation is required to accurately report the detection. Mass spectrometric data can be affected by several factors and, therefore, when the mass accuracy is barely higher than the established threshold different actions can be followed. The immediate verification should be the instrument performance by checking the mass accuracy with a set of reference standards injected alongside the sample injection run as quality controls. In addition, spectral interferences can affect the mass accuracy, which can be improved by a reinjection of the sample with enhanced resolution (which is often not available for many instruments). Also important is the dependence of mass error on the signal intensity. The lower the number of ions measured, the higher the mass error; therefore, low abundant fragments often show higher mass errors 58 . The same applies for high intensity ions, which can distort mass accuracy because of detector saturation.</p>
        <p>On another point, either a RT error slightly higher than 0.1 min or a ∆CCS faintly greater than 2% would require the fortification of the original sample with the candidate compound and/or modification in the chromatographic conditions to fully confirm its identity. However, in our own experience the chance of having deviations greater than 2% in the CCS is low because of the robustness of the CCS measurements. So, not all the parameter deviations should be weighted uniformly, since retention time is more prone to be shifted by sample matrix 11 . Consequently, a variation in RT slightly questions the identification of a candidate that perfectly matches the reference standard for HRMS data and CCS. On the contrary, a CCS deviation higher than 2% strongly questions the identification. In this sense, the minimum requirement for identity confirmation as Level 1 is established at 5 IP, which already considers the possibility of deviations in RT but needs an agreement of CCS. For those particular cases when empirical data do not completely fit the reference standard, reporting the candidate at the corresponding level with a reduced score (&lt; 5 IP) and accompanied with a clarification on the parameter failing in the requirements is proposed in order to comprehensively report the data (e.g. highlighted with an asterisk as Level x*). Obviously, the fact that one parameter (commonly RT and mass error) is slightly out of tolerance (typically 0.1 min and 5 ppm, respectively) would reduce the confidence, but might not be as crucial as other important parameters, such as CCS deviation or the presence of fragment ions in agreement with experimental data or spectral libraries.</p>
        <p>The application of efficient strategies for the wide-scope screening of OMPs in environmental samples has become essential. While strategies involving HRMS may lead to misidentifications in some cases 11,35,[59][60][61][62][63] , IMS-HRMS instruments provide an extra identification parameter that improves the performance and helps to reduce the number of false positives/negatives 10 . In this section, we highlight different identification scenarios using the developed CCS library to show the potential of IMS-HRMS in environmental analysis. It summarizes some of the experience gathered through the utilization of IMS-HRMS in different research studies. fragments were observed at their m/z (mass error &lt;5 ppm). In addition, the experimental CCS for the candidate was 154.08 Å 2 , which only deviates by + 0.01 % from the standard. In the light of the full agreement of all these measurements and using the criteria previously proposed, the identification of this candidate as 4-acetamidoantipyrin was confirmed as level 1 with 6 IP (MS + RT + &gt;2 HRMS fragments + CCS).</p>
        <p>As stated above, in environmental samples, the matrix composition can strongly influence compound retention and, therefore, the RT for most of the analytes 11 . This fact may lead to a notable increase in the number of misidentifications because of significant RT deviation between standard and sample. Nevertheless, the excellent reproducibility observed for CCS values, and the fact that this parameter is not affected by matrix composition, provides extra identification power, which is especially useful for compounds partially out of the confirmation criteria. As an illustrative example, Figure 3 shows the detection of thiabendazole, a fungicide used to control fungal diseases in fruits and vegetables, in the mouth of a Spanish river in the Mediterranean basin identified at level 1* (i.e. RT deviation beyond limits). The RT for thiabendazole reference standard was 3.27 min with a CCS value of 137.44 Å 2 . However, the RT in the sample was 3.51 min, and seemed notably affected by matrix composition, with a deviation of + 0.24 min. The RT difference between standard and sample is far in excess of the typical criterion established for confirmation (± 0.1 min) (Figure 1) not earning, in consequence, the 1 IP for RT agreement. On the contrary, ion mobility was not affected by the matrix and resulted in a CCS value of 137.27 Å 2 , which only deviated -0.12 % from the standard. In addition, the protonated molecule and three fragments were observed with mass error below 5 ppm. Under these conditions, the identity of this compound as thiabendazole could be confirmed at level 1* with 5 IP (MS + &gt;2 HRMS fragments + CCS). This example illustrates that RT affected by matrix composition may hamper the confirmation process in wide-scope screening, while the application of CCS provides the extra value needed for confirmation. In cases in which the RT notably deviates from the standard, some guidelines recommend to spike the sample with the candidate standard to confirm the identity of the compound 45 . However, the additional confidence gathered with the CCS measurement in a single-injection reduces time and costs of spiking and re-injecting the sample, as two separate pieces of evidence already exist (MS + &gt;2 HRMS fragments + CCS ). This is of special interest in environmental screening strategies where ion mobility can be included as an additional criterion for reliable identification in forthcoming guidelines in different fields of analytical research.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the robustness of CCS measurements allows this parameter to be used also as an extra point of confidence when the reference standard is not available. Prediction tools can offer an estimation of the CCS value that can easily be compared to the measured value of the tentatively identified compound 49,51,54 . This is the case of the tentative identification of valifenalate in spinach It is worth emphasizing at this point that the proposed levels of confidence in the identification and the discussion of the examples are both based on the knowledge gathered by the authors through the use of IMS-HRMS in several studies. The expertise of the mass spectrometrist should be the rationale behind the application of the levels of confidence for IMS-HRMS analyses. The results from the screening should be deeply reviewed by experienced researchers and data critically discussed if there is a deviation on the criteria (such as mass spectrometric accuracy or RT deviation), avoiding immediate exclusion of potential positives by an automated application of strict criteria. Although the use of mass spectrometric databases and/or predictive models give more confidence into the results, the experience of the analyst is crucial in the elucidation of compounds through the utilization of common mass fragmentation rules 65 . Additionally, the sample origin and its characteristics can be determinant when considering potential candidate structures for the empirical features, and this knowledge can only come up from a human being and not (yet) from an automated processing software.</p>
        <p>The use of IMS-HRMS for wide-scope screening of OMPs in environmental analyses is a powerful instrument for an enhanced analytical performance. One of the major benefits of ion mobility, which is usually insufficiently acknowledged in the scientific literature, is the simplification of mass spectral interpretation. In addition to separating chromatographically co-eluting ions, ion mobility also filters both LE and HE spectra, removing ions that do not belong to the candidate of interest 6,33 . This includes the removal of other co-eluting compounds that could be producing HE fragments as well as the reduction of matrix-endogenous interferences, thereby decreasing the number of peaks in a spectrum to be interpreted and thus also the risk of false fragment library matching. As an illustrative example, Figure 5 shows the comparison of LE and HE spectra of benzoylecgonine, the main metabolite resulting from cocaine use, of a reference standard (Figure 5a)</p>
        <p>and a positive finding in a wastewater sample with the drift time aligned (Figure 5b) and non-drift time aligned spectra (Figure 5c). When no ion mobility separation is applied (Figure 5c), the spectrum is much more populated with ions that do not originate from benzoylecgonine than in the drift time aligned spectrum (Figure 5b), with a quality comparable to the reference standard spectrum. The fact that IMS-HRMS provides 'clean' spectra, because of matrix interferences and co-eluting ions separation, strongly facilitates the spectral interpretation and identification process in wide-scope screening strategies, especially in comparison with non-ion mobility HRMS instruments 6 .</p>
        <p>Despite the benefits of IMS-HRMS, some limitations should also be mentioned. The IMS-HRMS instrument used in this study, VION IMS-QTOF mass spectrometer from Waters, has the mobility separation cell located between the ionization source and the mass analyzer. Therefore, ions constantly produced in the ionization source need to be packed in small groups of ions every 14 ms in order to separate them by their mobility. To this aim, a trap is located before the separation cell.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the release process of the trapped ions seemed to cause additional fragmentation in the LE function for labile (de)protonated molecules. As an example, Figure 6 highlights the LE fragmentation for the new psychoactive substance 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine (2C-E). A routine revision of HRMS data in screening analyses is often performed making use of the aforementioned advantages of IMS-HRMS, and therefore, revising drift time aligned MS data. That would be the case of spectra shown in Figure 6a, which apparently is a proper spectrum for a potential positive of 2C-E with a protonated adduct m/z 210.14883 in the LE function and significant fragments in the HE function. However, the non-drift time aligned MS spectra (Figure 6b), shows that the most abundant ion does not really correspond to the protonated adduct (m/z 210.14886, green shadowed) but to the ammonia loss fragment (m/z 193.12222, blue shadowed) followed by other LE fragments such as m/z 178.09871 and m/z 163.07529. Further investigation revealed that all these ions showed different ion mobility (different DT) (Figure 6c), which confirms that they were produced at some stage before the mobility separator device. The extra fragmentation observed was confirmed to be a 'premobility' fragmentation behavior but not an enhanced 'in-source' fragmentation since the fragmentation did not occur when working in conventional MS E mode (i.e. with no mobility separation) (Figure S7). This 'pre-mobility' fragmentation produced a ten-fold decrease in the intensity of the protonated adduct of 2C-E, which may hamper the discovery of this compound in a real-sample scenario. Therefore, this particular 'pre-mobility' fragmentation may have negative consequences in environmental analysis where most of detections and subsequent identifications are based on the presence of the protonated molecules. The reduced intensity of the protonated adduct of the molecule can favor false negative identifications, especially for low abundant and very labile compounds such as some psychoactive substances in wastewater samples. It is noteworthy that this particular example was observed using a VION IMS-QTOF instrument and, therefore, cannot be directly extrapolated to other IMS instrument. However, the nature of IMS separation and the building of mobility devices make it feasible that other manufacturer instruments may suffer from a similar 'pre-mobility' phenomenon.</p>
        <p>In summary, although the above-mentioned limitations have been observed, IMS-HRMS has strong potential for wide-scope screening of OMPs and notably facilitates screening strategies in highly complex matrices. The much cleaner drift time aligned MS spectra enhances the identification process, and the excellent robustness of CCS measurements in different matrices enables CCS prediction tools to help in tentative identification of candidates when the reference standard is not available. This enhances the confirmation rate if the reference is eventually acquired for confirmation.</p>
