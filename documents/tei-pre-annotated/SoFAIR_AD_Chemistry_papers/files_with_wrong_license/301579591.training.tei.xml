        <p>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exist as ensembles of rapidly interconverting conformers, therefore cannot be described by a single three-dimensional structure [1][2][3].Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) exist as ensembles of rapidly interconverting conformers, therefore cannot be described by a single three-dimensional structure [1][2][3].</p>
        <p>Their unique physicochemical properties derive from the polymer-like properties [4] of polypeptide chains in combination with the specific characteristics of the interaction pattern resulting from the primary sequence. Among the naturally occurring amino acids, proline has peculiar properties due to its cyclic structure, which links the backbone nitrogen with its sidechain generating a pyrrolidine ring that constrains its available conformational space. These steric restraints reduce the energy difference between cis/trans conformers involving peptide bonds between proline residues and the amino acids preceding them (Xaa-Pro peptide bonds). While for non-cyclic amino acids the occurrence of the cis conformation is less than a 0.5%, the cyclic nature of prolines slightly disfavors the trans conformation, leading to increased cis populations, typically ranging from 5 to 10% [5,6].Their unique physicochemical properties derive from the polymer-like properties [4] of polypeptide chains in combination with the specific characteristics of the interaction pattern resulting from the primary sequence.

        <p>The energetic barrier in cis and trans interconversion is estimated to be around 84 kJ/mol - 1 , high enough to have distinct separate species with a significant lifetime (i.e. interconversion rates of 10 -3 s -1 ), existing in 'slow' exchange.

        <p>The role of proline residues in highly flexible disordered polypeptide chains has been a long discussed topic, and has involved many hypotheses [9][10][11][12][13]. The peculiarities of this amino acid have been a focus of study due to its pivotal role in protein-protein interactions [14], backbone rearrangements [8,15], post-translational modifications [16,17] and secondary structure formation [18][19][20][21]. Experimental data, however, were sparse mainly due to methodological limitations.The role of proline residues in highly flexible disordered polypeptide chains has been a long discussed topic, and has involved many hypotheses [9][10][11][12][13].

        <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a unique tool to characterize the structure and dynamics of proteins at atomic resolution. Most methods used in the study of biomolecules rely on the detection of 1 H, which offers better inherent sensitivity due to its higher gyromagnetic ratio compared to 13 C and 15 N. The general approach for a well-structured protein consists in exploiting the amide proton ( 1 H N ) in combination with the backbone nitrogen ( 15 N) as readout due to its ease of detection and the resulting favorable overall cross-peak dispersion that allows to observe the 'fingerprint' of a protein of interest by simple 2D spectra. However, this method has limitations when dealing with IDPs, in particular when approaching physiological conditions. On one side, 1 H N is highly sensitive to its environment, in particular to pH and temperature, which may compromise its use for studies under such conditions due to rapid exchange with the solvent. In addition, it does not provide information about proline residues, which lack the amide proton. This also complicates their sequence specific assignment, although approaches have been developed to partially 'by-pass' this limitation [22,23]. Alternative detection schemes for prolines involve aliphatic proton-carbon ( 1 H- 13 C ali ) correlation spectroscopy [12,16,24]. Despite many observable correlations ( 1 H α -13 C α and 1 H ali - 13 C ali ), these experiments have very poor chemical shift dispersion characteristics and are largely insensitive to their backbone environment. Moreover, the large number of proline residues in IDPs leads to extensive cross-peak overlap that hampers their investigation at atomic resolution.Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a unique tool to characterize the structure and dynamics of proteins at atomic resolution.

        <p>An attractive option to obtain NMR spectroscopic information on proline residues is the use of direct 13 C observation [25]. To our knowledge, the first reference making use of direct 13 C-detection for the study of prolines dates back to 1973 and was proposed by the Bovey group [26] and few years later, in 1976, by the Wüthrich group [27]. However, this approach was abandoned due to the low sensitivity of these experiments. The advances in obtaining 13 C/ 15 N-enriched recombinant proteins and the development of cryogenicallycooled NMR probeheads for the direct detection of heteronuclei [28], which have boosted sensitivity, allowed the viability of direct 13 C and 15 N detection to study macromolecules [29][30][31][32][33]. More interestingly, as the chemical shifts of an NMR cross-peak depend on the two nuclei involved in the peptide bond, the 2D correlation of carbonyl carbon and amide nitrogen nuclear spins across the peptide bond ( 13 C′ i -15 N i+1 ) results in exquisite signal dispersion in the so-called CON spectrum (Fig. 1A) [34,35]. This is largely independent of tertiary structure and provides well-resolved information about all amino acids including proline, even in IDPs. In other words, CON spectra provide the most complete twodimensional fingerprint of an IDP and they are a key tool for their complete characterization [36,37].An attractive option to obtain NMR spectroscopic information on proline residues is the use of direct 13 C observation [25].

        <p>Here we make use of direct 13 C-detection tools [38][39][40][41][42] to fully characterize the cis/trans equilibrium of proline residues in Coturnix japonica Osteopontin (OPN), an extracellular IDP that exerts its function by binding to numerous components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), including two types of membrane receptors: integrins and CD44. Its activity is highly regulated by post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, glycosylation and protein cleavage), splicing of OPN and CD44 and several binding events with different extracellular ligands. The correct interpretation of the extracellular stimuli is key for cell behavior and a deregulation of OPN has been related to metastatic and abnormal cell function [43][44][45][46][47]. OPN contains regions with significant compaction that enable the correct exposure of many of the interacting motifs, like the RGD motif (Fig. 1C) [48], indicating a potential role of these compact states for its function. Thus, OPN is an ideal case to study the role of proline residues in IDPs and the relevance of cis/trans conformers for stabilizing local conformation and long-range contacts.Here we make use of direct 13 C-detection tools [38][39][40][41][42] to fully characterize the cis/trans equilibrium of proline residues in Coturnix japonica Osteopontin (OPN), an extracellular IDP that exerts its function by binding to numerous components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), including two types of membrane receptors: integrins and CD44.

        <p>Given the low population of the minor species special emphasis was put into optimizing the sensitivity of the standard assignment experiments exploiting 13 C detection (3D (H)CBCACON and 3D (H)CBCANCO) [29,35,49] (see Method details). Signal assignment cannot be achieved simply by comparison with the major form chemical shifts because cross-peaks displacements of the minor form relative to the main peaks are substantial and do not follow a simple regular pattern. Standard assignment strategies based on the correlation of C α , C β and C′ of consecutive residues (Fig. 2A) allow the assignment of most of the residues when spectral overlap is not pronounced. The 3D (H)CCCON [34] provides additional information about side chain shifts of aliphatic carbons (C ali ), a key aspect to distinguish residues that have similar C α and C β chemical shifts. However, this strategy fails when dealing with similar sequence repeats. In particular, proline sidechain carbons share very similar chemical shifts and several ambiguities might remain during the sequence-specific assignment procedure. The 3D COCON experiment [38,39] is an excellent complementary experiment because it correlates carbonyl signals of three or more consecutive residues by transferring the magnetization across the 3 J C'C' couplings (0.5-3.0Hz) via isotropic mixing. In order to detect cross peaks involving the minor species, characterized by low signal-to-noise ratio, a sensitivity improvement was introduced into the original 3D COCON experiment. By taking advantage of the higher 1 H polarization, initial magnetization was transferred from 1 H α to 13 C α and then to 13 C′ prior to the beginning of the COCON experiment. This resulted in an approximate increase of the S/N ratio per unit time by a factor of 1.65 (Fig. S1A-B). The detection of sequential connectivities in the 3D (HCA)COCON (Fig. 2B) in combination with those observed in the 3D (H)CBCACON, 3D (H)CBCANCO and 3D (H)CCCON allowed the assignment of both major and minor forms in OPN. Under the present experimental conditions, the (HCA)COCON spectra gave the most complete information by correlating at least three (from δ( 15 N) i to i+2) residues in all cases and, in some cases even five residues (from δ( 15 N) i-1 to i+3). The signal intensity of the off-diagonal signals is directly dependent on the value(s) of the intervening 3 J C'C' coupling constants. In the subspectra associated with the minor forms some of the cross-peaks connecting proline residues to their following residues show low to vanishing intensity (Fig. S1C). As the connections to the preceding residues are usually still present, this is not simply an issue of reduced spectral sensitivity reflecting the low effective concentration of the minor species, but rather suggests a consistently small value for the The chemical shifts of side chain carbon atoms of proline residues obtained through the analysis of the 3D (H)CCCON were very useful to confirm that the minor form observed derives from cis/trans isomers of Xaa-Pro peptide bonds. Indeed, as initially proposed by Schubert and others [52,53] cis conformations can be identified by the difference between C β and C γ chemical shifts, which is larger in the case of cis-Pro relative to trans-Pro. As shown in Figure 3A, the minor forms observed in the proline region follow this pattern and are mostly in the cis conformation (Fig. S2).Given the low population of the minor species special emphasis was put into optimizing the sensitivity of the standard assignment experiments exploiting 13 C detection (3D (H)CBCACON and 3D (H)CBCANCO) [29,35,49] (see Method details).

        <p>Cis/trans isomerization at positions of proline residue also affects the neighboring residues, similarly to 1 H N shift differences observed between cis/trans-induced forms in α-synuclein [11]. Specifically, we observed that (i) the percentage of cis-Pro conformers is conserved along the signals of minor forms of consecutive residues surrounding the proline (Fig. S3A) and (ii) the difference in chemical shifts between major and minor forms is large for residues i±1 and gradually decreases until position i±3, where it coincides with the position of the major form (Fig. S3B-C), indicating that proline isomerization has a drastic effect at the local level in a range spanning residues i±3.Cis/trans isomerization at positions of proline residue also affects the neighboring residues, similarly to 1 H N shift differences observed between cis/trans-induced forms in α-synuclein [11].

        <p>Another observation that can be easily depicted is the position of C α and C β shifts of residues preceding a proline (BMRB ID: 27443 and Table S4), which reflects the fact that residues preceding a Pro are biased towards an extended conformation. A typical indication of a proline in the following position is the up-field shift of C α . This is easily recognized for all residues (see examples of V81, V90, F121, A125, A128, Q178, L196, R207 present in OPN). More interestingly, for some of these residues (V81, V90, F121 and R207) the C β carbons experience a comparable downfield shift, thus indicating specific conformational changes at these sites.Another observation that can be easily depicted is the position of C α and C β shifts of residues preceding a proline (BMRB ID: 27443 and Table S4), which reflects the fact that residues preceding a Pro are biased towards an extended conformation.

        <p>To conclude, given the substantially improved sensitivity of the new pulse sequences, the CON cross peaks of both trans and cis forms, including their sidechains, of the 12 proline residues present in OPN could be assigned. Additionally, the minor forms of several proline neighbors were assigned (11 out of 12 in the i-1 positions; 6 out of 12 in the i+1 positions; and some in i±2 and i±3 positions). The assignment of the minor forms can be found in the Table S4. This also further extends the assignment already achieved for OPN (deposited with BMRB as ID 27443) comprising 99.1% of N, C′, C α and C β (major form).To conclude, given the substantially improved sensitivity of the new pulse sequences, the CON cross peaks of both trans and cis forms, including their sidechains, of the 12 proline residues present in OPN could be assigned.

        <p>Relative populations of trans and cis species were determined by taking peak volumes from the 13 C-detected 2D CON spectra (Fig. 1B). It is well-known that prolines display high cis population, ranging from 5 to 10% in proteins, while even higher percentages have been observed for small peptides [54][55][56]. In addition, this equilibrium can be modulated by the chemical environment (for example, by the occurrence of phosphorylation [17] and/or by secondary structure propensities). In the case of OPN, experimental data clearly indicate that all proline residues sample both the trans and the cis conformation, with populations for cis conformers that significantly deviate from percentages reported for other IDPs (around 5-10%) like α-synuclein [11] or tau [12]. P88, P91, P122 and P126 also show an additional minor form with a trans signature (Fig. 1B and Fig. 3B) likely coupled with the cis conformation of neighboring proline residues.Relative populations of trans and cis species were determined by taking peak volumes from the 13 C-detected 2D CON spectra (Fig. 1B).

        <p>It is worth noting that for P88, P122, P129 and P185, the population of the cis forms is greater than 10% (Fig. 3B) and this higher cis population correlate with the presence of aromatic residues (Phe or Trp) in either i±1 position (Fig. 1C and Fig. S4A). Indeed, as an example, the mutation to alanine of phenylalanine 121 (preceding proline 122), induces a lower cis population of the peptide bond linking the two aminoacids compared to the wildtype protein (from 13% to 7%, Fig. S5) confirming the importance of the direct interaction between aromatic and proline residues to stabilize the cis conformer.It is worth noting that for P88, P122, P129 and P185, the population of the cis forms is greater than 10% (Fig. 3B) and this higher cis population correlate with the presence of aromatic residues (Phe or Trp) in either i±1 position (Fig. 1C and Fig. S4A).

        <p>To further characterize the role of proline cis/trans isomerism and its impact on the structural dynamics of OPN, we measured 15 N relaxation parameters [57] (Fig. 4A and Fig. 5). A comparison of 15 N-R 2 relaxation parameters in the major and minor forms for residues other than proline showed comparable local dynamics in both states, although some specific changes occur (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, increased 15 N transverse relaxation rates were consistently found for residues within the region of residues 140-175. This region is known to be the most compact segment of OPN comprising most of the binding regions of this protein and housing both hydrophobic and charged residues to exploit for its stabilization [48]. Additionally, residues in the regions 120-132 and 175-190 and flanking the core region of OPN also show reduced conformational dynamics resulting in higher 15 N transverse relaxation rates. Notably, the mutation of F121A reduces the 15 N-R 2 rates of these flanking regions accompanied by a moderate decompaction of the region 140-175 (Figure S5B). This dynamic pattern is largely conserved in the minor forms and thus suggests that there are no substantial global differences in dynamics between signals stemming from proline cis/trans isomerization. However, 15 N-R 2 and heteronuclear 15 N-{ 1 H} NOEs (Fig. 4B) provide some evidence for reduced local mobility in the cis-forms presumably due to the tilt of the polypeptide chain. This is consistent with the observed increased 15 N-R 2 rates for the 15 N of cis-Pro (Fig. 5). Due to the pronounced flexibility in IDPs 15 N spin relaxation is typically dominated by local fluctuations on different timescales rather than the global tumbling of the protein [58][59][60][61][62]. In a fully extended conformation 15 N transverse relaxation is dominated by fast time scale motions around the C α -C α direction [58,59,[63][64][65], as described by the (GAF) Gaussian Axial Fluctuation model [66]. Bending of the polypeptide chain due to formation of the cis-form may restrict this dynamic mode and increase the effective local correlation time which would be accompanied by faster 15 N-R 2 relaxation. Several mechanisms could explain these differences in relaxation, i.e. interactions that generate local compaction. A plausible explanation could be the increase of conformations resembling those found in PPI helices in contrast to the conventional PPII form often sampled by proline-rich segments [67]. Although the changes in backbone dihedral angles are rather small the switch from PPII to PPI results in a significant compaction of the polypeptide chain. While PPII is an elongated left-handed helix PPI is a compacted right-handed helix. The average helical pitch per residue in PPI is around 5.6 Å and thus very similar to the value found in a typical α-helix. In contrast, the more extended PPII motif has a helical pitch of 9.4 Å. In order to test the hypothesis of a potential PPII-to-PPI switch we performed a quantitative analysis of secondary structure propensities by the program δ2D [68] separately using the shifts of major and minor forms, which shows that the cis-Pro leads to lower PPII populations compensated by either coil or β-strand conformations (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the largest changes in 15 N-R 2 rates were observed for P82, P85, P88, P122, P126 and P236. Strikingly, most of them (all except P236) belong to stretches containing consecutive P-X-X-P motifs and is thus more likely to form a continuous PPI helix. However, PPI-PPII transitions are challenging to pick up solely from chemical shift data and a cause-effect direct connection could not be obtained from these results alone.To further characterize the role of proline cis/trans isomerism and its impact on the structural dynamics of OPN, we measured 15 N relaxation parameters [57] (Fig. 4A and Fig. 5). A comparison of 15 N-R 2 relaxation parameters in the major and minor forms for residues other than proline showed comparable local dynamics in both states, although some specific changes occur (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, increased 15 N transverse relaxation rates were consistently found for residues within the region of residues 140-175. This region is known to be the most compact segment of OPN comprising most of the binding regions of this protein and housing both hydrophobic and charged residues to exploit for its stabilization [48]. Additionally, residues in the regions 120-132 and 175-190 and flanking the core region of OPN also show reduced conformational dynamics resulting in higher 15 N transverse relaxation rates. Notably, the mutation of F121A reduces the 15 N-R 2 rates of these flanking regions accompanied by a moderate decompaction of the region 140-175 (Figure S5B). This dynamic pattern is largely conserved in the minor forms and thus suggests that there are no substantial global differences in dynamics between signals stemming from proline cis/trans isomerization. However, 15 N-R 2 and heteronuclear 15 N-{ 1 H} NOEs (Fig. 4B) provide some evidence for reduced local mobility in the cis-forms presumably due to the tilt of the polypeptide chain. This is consistent with the observed increased 15 N-R 2 rates for the 15 N of cis-Pro (Fig. 5). Due to the pronounced flexibility in IDPs 15 N spin relaxation is typically dominated by local fluctuations on different timescales rather than the global tumbling of the protein [58][59][60][61][62]. In a fully extended conformation 15 N transverse relaxation is dominated by fast time scale motions around the C α -C α direction [58,59,[63][64][65], as described by the (GAF) Gaussian Axial Fluctuation model [66]. Bending of the polypeptide chain due to formation of the cis-form may restrict this dynamic mode and increase the effective local correlation time which would be accompanied by faster 15 N-R 2 relaxation. Several mechanisms could explain these differences in relaxation, i.e. interactions that generate local compaction. A plausible explanation could be the increase of conformations resembling those found in PPI helices in contrast to the conventional PPII form often sampled by proline-rich segments [67]. Although the changes in backbone dihedral angles are rather small the switch from PPII to PPI results in a significant compaction of the polypeptide chain. While PPII is an elongated left-handed helix PPI is a compacted right-handed helix. The average helical pitch per residue in PPI is around 5.6 Å and thus very similar to the value found in a typical α-helix. In contrast, the more extended PPII motif has a helical pitch of 9.4 Å. In order to test the hypothesis of a potential PPII-to-PPI switch we performed a quantitative analysis of secondary structure propensities by the program δ2D [68] separately using the shifts of major and minor forms, which shows that the cis-Pro leads to lower PPII populations compensated by either coil or β-strand conformations (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the largest changes in 15 N-R 2 rates were observed for P82, P85, P88, P122, P126 and P236. Strikingly, most of them (all except P236) belong to stretches containing consecutive P-X-X-P motifs and is thus more likely to form a continuous PPI helix. However, PPI-PPII transitions are challenging to pick up solely from chemical shift data and a cause-effect direct connection could not be obtained from these results alone.</p>
        <p>In order to probe putative changes in long-range contacts resulting from cis/trans isomerization of proline residues, we carried out a series of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments. We exploit 13 C-detected PRE by observing intensities of the paramagnetic and diamagnetic forms [69]. 1 H α -start experiments are more sensitive to paramagnetic effects because protons, with their high gyromagnetic ratio compared to carbon, are reintroduced in the coherence transfer pathway to transfer coherence from protons to heteronuclei ( 13 C or 15 N). Thus, we used 1 H α -start experiments to measure 13 Cdetected PRE to observe prolines and get higher dataset completeness. Overall, the PRE profiles of both major and minor forms obtained for the various spin label positions showed a very similar behavior (Fig. 7). Notable exceptions only occurred for residues located in the region 120-132 (i.e. D120, F121, T123 and E124) which showed slightly larger PRE effects when the spin label is located in position 188, as well as the region 80-90 (paralleled by an increased 15 N R 2 rate) with the spin label at position 108.In order to probe putative changes in long-range contacts resulting from cis/trans isomerization of proline residues, we carried out a series of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments.

        <p>Additionally, putative changes in long-range correlations were also probed by measuring 1 H N -R 2 rates using standard 1 H N -detected experiments. In the interpretation of these rates care has to be taken as 1 H N -R 2 rates may also contain slight contributions from intermolecular exchange with bulk water. We find the largest differences between major (stemming from trans-Pro) and minor (stemming from cis-Pro) forms in the proline-rich regions located at the termini (120-130 and 180-190) of the central region of OPN characterized by largest compaction (100-190) (Fig. S6A-B). Summing up, PRE rates were largely comparable in both Pro forms suggesting that the overall (tertiary) compaction is maintained and only local dynamics are different between trans-Pro and cis-Pro forms.Additionally, putative changes in long-range correlations were also probed by measuring 1 H N -R 2 rates using standard 1 H N -detected experiments.

        <p>Finally, to obtain more specific information about differential side-chain structural dynamics we performed 15 N-{ 1 H} heteronuclear NOE and 15 N 3D NOESY-HSQC experiments. We use the side-chain signals of tryptophan residues in the stretch (W 183 -W 184 -P 185 ) as proxies for the dynamic measurements (Fig. S9). We were particularly interested in the impact of proline cis/trans isomerization on the side-chain dynamics of W183 and W184 as this would provide prototypical information about the consequences of Pro-aromatic side-chain packing on local conformational dynamics. It can be clearly seen that minor (stemming from cis-Pro) and major (stemming from trans-Pro) forms of W183 and W184, which are directly adjacent to P185, display distinctly different conformational dynamics (Fig. S9).Finally, to obtain more specific information about differential side-chain structural dynamics we performed 15 N-{ 1 H} heteronuclear NOE and 15 N 3D NOESY-HSQC experiments.

        <p>While the two forms of W183 show nearly identical 15 N-{ 1 H} NOEs, the minor form of W184 is evidently different and exhibits significantly restricted motions in the (fast) ps timescale (Fig. 8A-B) and increased water exchange properties (Fig. S9C) while keeping similar 15 N-T 1 and 15 N-T 2 relaxation (Fig. S9A-B). Additionally, different indole 1 H N NOEs to protons of the side-chains further corroborate the finding of changes in side-chain orientations in the minor form of W184 (Fig. 8C). It can thus be concluded that steric repulsion due to distinct π•CH-aromatic interactions lead to restricted local mobility in the cis-Pro form, as illustrated in Fig. 8D.While the two forms of W183 show nearly identical 15 N-{ 1 H} NOEs, the minor form of W184 is evidently different and exhibits significantly restricted motions in the (fast) ps timescale (Fig. 8A-B) and increased water exchange properties (Fig. S9C) while keeping similar 15 N-T 1 and 15 N-T 2 relaxation (Fig. S9A-B).

        <p>Proline residues are highly abundant in IDPs, although their role is still elusive. A unique property of prolines in proteins is their significantly higher than other residues' tendency to from cis peptide bond isomers. The percentage of cis-Pro population is known to vary between 5-10% and has been reported for previously studied IDPs like α-synuclein [11] and tau [12]. In addition, this population can be drastically affected by phosphorylation [17] and specific protein-protein interactions [70]. In the present manuscript, we used 13 The tunable stabilization of cis conformers by π•CH interaction between the aromatic sidechain and the proline ring has been described mainly for small molecules and peptides [55,56,71] and recently for the TAD domain of BMAL1 [72]. This stabilization is limited to prolines (at position i) and aromatics in positions i±1 and i-2. Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence that these weak interactions remain relevant in the context of a large IDP. We found that OPN shows particularly high cis-Pro populations, reaching cis-Pro percentages around 20% in some cases. Most importantly, the highest populations of cis-Pro conformers were found for prolines in close proximity to aromatic residues. The mutation of an aromatic residue to alanine leads to a drastic reduction in cis-Pro population. We thus conclude that π•CH interactions between aromatic sidechains and proline rings are highly relevant for the stabilization of local structural segments in IDPs.Proline residues are highly abundant in IDPs, although their role is still elusive.

        <p>Aromatic amino acids, leucines and proline residues are well-conserved in IDPs [5], but hydrophobic and proline residues have an opposite behavior with respect to their relative abundance when comparing ordered and disordered proteins [73]. Prolines are highly abundant in IDPs and are usually considered as disorder-promoting residues [5,74]. We thus performed a statistical analysis of the discussed motifs in globular proteins and IDPs.Aromatic amino acids, leucines and proline residues are well-conserved in IDPs [5], but hydrophobic and proline residues have an opposite behavior with respect to their relative abundance when comparing ordered and disordered proteins [73].

        <p>In our data sets (PDB for globular proteins (https://www.wwpdb.org) and 
            <rs type="software">DISPROT</rs> for disordered segments (http://www.disprot.org)) (Fig. S4B-C), we found Pro residues to be more abundant in IDPs (7.3%) than in globular proteins (4.4%), whereas for aromatics the opposite was found (IDPs: 5.1 %, globular proteins: 9.5 %), in line with values previously reported [75]. The comparison between globular proteins vs IDPs with respect to the prevalence of aromatic-proline pairs revealed that in IDPs 14% of prolines have aromatic residues in positions i±1 and i-2 and thus in positions where the π•CH stacking interaction can take place, whereas, in globular proteins this number is 27%. Thus, our experimental findings that these sequence motifs are found in regions of significant structural compaction and that their mutations reduce, to a certain degree, this state are suggesting that these motifs might serve as nucleation sites for facilitating the formation of compact states in IDPs. In addition, it points out to the relevance of aromatic-proline interactions for the stabilization of underlying structure in IDPs. Although systematic studies on the biological significance of aromatic-proline amino acids pairs in disordered segments are currently lacking, a first hint was provided with the Pro-Trp pair in BMAL1 [72] which is strongly conserved and key for the regulation of circadian rhythms. Another example is given by the unique domain of Src-family kinases which contains an unusual number of hydrophobic residues for an IDR and which are intercalated with prolines. Arbesú et al. [76] have shown that phenylalanine residues in this IDR promote the compaction of this protein, they hypothesize that proline residues may compensate the entropic cost of this effect by retaining correlated local flexibility, as proposed elsewhere [77]. Further evidence for the relevance of this sequence motif is provided by the fact that aromatic residues are found in pre-structured molecular recognition motifs (also called MoRFs and PreSMos [78]). Our findings that π•CH interactions significantly reduce the conformational dynamics of the minor cis-Pro form in W184 can thus be regarded as a prototypical case for a general mechanism to modulate backbone as well as side-chain dynamics in IDPs. The compaction modulation provided by π•CH stacking interactions could reshape the conformational space sampled by OPN and in consequence, affects the binding events, such as the one with heparin. Previous work [48] showed an unfolding-upon-binding mechanism upon heparin interaction. This binding mechanism is possible if a certain degree of residual structure is retained in the apo-form to gain flexibility in other regions upon binding [79].

        <p>More in general, there is growing evidence that IDPs are far from being natively unfolded or disordered but rather exist as heterogeneous conformational ensembles. The distinct heterogeneities of these conformational ensembles and correlated conformational fluctuations within them can be quantitatively visualized by the Pearson correlation maps derived from PRE (and PRI) rates [80]. This is illustrated with two divergent OPNs (Homo sapiens vs. Coturnix japonica PRE rates in Fig. S6A andS6C, respectively) (Fig. 9).More in general, there is growing evidence that IDPs are far from being natively unfolded or disordered but rather exist as heterogeneous conformational ensembles.

        <p>Coturnix japonica OPN contains three regions of correlated fluctuations indicating considerable structural compaction and the existence of -at least-one compact state in OPN (Fig. 9 upper). Most importantly, extremely high concentrations of urea and high-salt concentrations are needed to completely denature (unfold) the protein [48], thus indicating that both backbone structural elements and electrostatic interactions are involved in generating these compact states. Interestingly, human OPN showed a different pattern of correlated segments, where oppositely charged regions are less correlated than its evolutionary far homolog (Fig. 9 lower). In order to assess the potential influence of different charge distributions we followed a strategy proposed by Pappu and co-workers [81], who have demonstrated the intimate relation between sequence distributions and ensemble conformations of polyampholites with simulations and introduced the parameter κ, which takes into account not only the overall charge of the polymer but additionally also the distribution of these charges along the primary sequence. The κ value for Coturnix japonica OPN (or quail OPN) is 0.262, corresponding to a typical value of a pre-molten globule in the interface between a weak and strong polyampholyte (79). Interestingly, despite the low interspecies protein sequence similarity (Fig. S7), the parameter κ (Table S5) is largely identical for the individual OPN family members (Fig. S7). The observed differences in correlated fluctuations (Fig. 9) can therefore not be explained by charge pattern but result from context-dependent interactions along OPN primary sequence.Coturnix japonica OPN contains three regions of correlated fluctuations indicating considerable structural compaction and the existence of -at least-one compact state in OPN (Fig. 9 upper).

        <p>Regarding the number of prolines and their location in OPN (Fig. S8 coloured circles), human OPN is significantly divergent from the quail form. In particular, the human Nterminal segment is enriched in prolines and the quail form is depleted. On the other side, aro-Pro motifs are conserved next to the positive charged patch at the central region of the protein (Fig. S8 red circles), suggesting a relevant role of those in the central compact state.Regarding the number of prolines and their location in OPN (Fig. S8 coloured circles), human OPN is significantly divergent from the quail form.

        <p>It is also instructive to compare our findings with a recent sequence analysis deciphering the evolutionary constraints acting on IDPs to disable a negative function (aggregation) [82]. In this study it was shown that representative ensembles of folded proteins and IDPs respond differently to randomization (while maintaining the overall amino acid distribution) of primary sequences. Most importantly, this study unveiled that in contrast to the widespread belief that protein disorder triggers aggregation-induced diseases, IDP sequences evolved during evolution to exactly avoid amyloidogenesis and increase solubility. In other words, the finding that amyloids are sometimes associated to IDPs obscures the fact that the vast majority of IDPs emerged under the evolutionary constraint to avoid aggregation. Thus, the significance of this protein property (aggregation propensity) and its relevance for disease results from its scarcity in IDPs. Based on our finding that aro-Pro sequence motifs are significantly less abundant in IDPs we postulate an analogous negative evolutionary constraint for IDP sequences. Since aro-Pro sequence motifs are depleted in IDPs their occurrence points to their significance. Our study of OPN showed that the aro-Pro sequence motifs exhibit significant local rigidification of the backbone chain and is thus in stark contrast to the conventional notion that proline residues are the origin of flexibility in IDPs. These structurally constrained sites can on the contrary act as nucleation sites for the formation of compact states in IDPs as their restricted motion reduces the entropic penalty for the formation of collapsed states. Most interestingly, the compact state(s) of OPN is (are) characterized by substantial long-range order [83]. Since there is typically a low sequence homology in related IDPs, we postulate that the conservation of (aro-Pro) sequence patterns indicates the existence of relevant and specific aro-Pro interactions and therefore suggests the existence of compact segments.

        <p>We therefore suggest reassessing the structural and functional role of prolines in IDPs. It is generally accepted that prolines are highly abundant in IDPs and on this basis are described as disorder promoting amino acids [73,74]. Based on our findings we suggest a more subtle and ambivalent role for prolines in IDPs. Proline residues are often found in specific local secondary structural elements called PPII helices. The unique structural arrangement of residues in PPII helices does not allow for tight packing interactions, and residues in PPII helices have therefore a smaller number of direct neighbours and consequently lower structural stabilization (or disorder for that matter). However, the data obtained in our study clearly show that the structural dynamics of proline residues depends significantly on the amino acid sequence context (i.e. neighbouring amino acids next to prolines in the primary sequence). Sequence patches including proline and aromatic amino acids display significant reduction of conformational flexibility, higher populations of cis-Pro configurations, and different π•CH stacking interactions between the proline and the aromatic ring systems.We therefore suggest reassessing the structural and functional role of prolines in IDPs.

        <p>To conclude, the observed novel proline features provide a versatile mechanism to modulate and tune the conformational ensembles of IDPs. For example, cis-trans isomerization will modulate the relative orientation of locally folded protein segments (i.e. regions displaying correlated structural fluctuations). The example of OPN provides a first glimpse on how the modulation of conformational ensembles in IDPs can be realized. Aro-Pro sequence motifs act as nucleation sites for the structural compaction reminiscent of diffusion-collision type of processes. The motional restriction (as evidenced by 15 N relaxation data) of these segments reduce the entropic penalty inherent to structure formation in IDPs. Moreover, our finding that these Pro-aromatic patches are located in hinge regions linking the three observed structural segments in OPN may point towards a general building principle. Since cis-trans isomerization is not only abundant in Pro-rich segments but can also be modulated by external factors (i.e. presence of prolyl-peptidyl isomerases, PPI, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation of neighbouring Tyr or Ser/Thr) it can be anticipated that these modulation possibilities are realized by nature in order to endow IDPs with the stunning structural plasticity and malleability necessary to adapt to the continuously changing molecular environment, cellular context, and thereby fulfilling their diverse biological functions.To conclude, the observed novel proline features provide a versatile mechanism to modulate and tune the conformational ensembles of IDPs.

Protein expression was induced at OD 600 of ca. 0.8 by adding 0.4 mM IPTG (Isopropyl-β-D-Thiogalactopyranoside). For expression of isotopically labelled protein for NMR studies, before induction the cells were harvested and pellets from 4 L LB resuspended in 1L M9-Minimal Media (containing 1g/L 15 NH 4 Cl and 3g/L 13 C-Glucose for 15 N and 13 C labelling respectively).

Protein expression was induced at OD 600 of ca. 0.8 by adding 0.4 mM IPTG (Isopropyl-β-D-Thiogalactopyranoside). For expression of isotopically labelled protein for NMR studies, before induction the cells were harvested and pellets from 4 L LB resuspended in 1L M9-Minimal Media (containing 1g/L 15 NH 4 Cl and 3g/L 13 C-Glucose for 15 N and 13 C labelling respectively). The expression was carried out at 27°C and 140rpm over-night. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 40 mL of cold PBS (2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2.5 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.3); freshly prepared 1mM DTT solution was added in the case of cysteine-mutated proteins preparations. The suspension was sonicated and warmed at 95°C for 10min. The lysate was centrifuged at 18000 rpm and ammonium sulfate precipitation (saturation of 50%) carried out with the supernatant. The pellet was resuspended in PBS, diluted 1:2 with water to lower the salt concentration and an anion-exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q, GE healthcare) performed. The column was equilibrated with PBS and a gradient of 30% High-Salt Buffer (PBS containing 1 M NaCl) run in 20 minutes at 2 mL/min. A pETM11 plasmid encoding for the Homo sapiens OPN with a histidine tag was transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta phage resistant strain. The steps were the same as its homolog described above. Nine cysteine-mutants of the Homo sapiens OPN (G25C, Q50C, D90C, D130C, T185C, D210, S239C, S267C and S311C) were produced.</p>
        <p>Regarding the purification, the harvested cell suspension was sonicated and cooked at 95°C for 10min. The lysate was centrifuged at 18000 rpm and the supernatant loaded onto a HisTrap® (GE Healthcare) affinity column. The protein was eluted with high-imidazole Buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 500 mM Imidazole, pH 8). The protein was concentrated in TEV-Cleavage Buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), TEV protease was added in a ratio of 1:50 and incubated over-night at 4°C under agitation to get rid of the affinity tag. Further purification was carried out with ion-exchange chromatography (HiTrapQ® -GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with PBS and a gradient of 50% High-Salt Buffer (PBS containing 1 M NaCl) run in 30 minutes at 1 mL/min. Protein purity was confirmed via SDS-PAGE.Regarding the purification, the harvested cell suspension was sonicated and cooked at 95°C for 10min.

        <p>The free thiol concentration was measured using a 300 µM DTNB (5,5'-dithiobis-(2nitrobenzoic acid))-solution at 412 nm. A 3-fold excess of MTSL was added and the sample incubated for 3 hours at 37°C during agitati on. The free thiol concentration was measured again to confirm complete tagging of the protein. Protein purity was confirmed via SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Although these signals are easy to identify due to their regular pattern of displacement, they can lead to unwanted signal overlap and complicate spectral analysis. Therefore, the lowest possible concentration of D 2 O (typically 1-2%) has been used during the measurements to reduce the intensity of this set of additional cross peaks below detection level.The free thiol concentration was measured using a 300 µM DTNB (5,5'-dithiobis-(2nitrobenzoic acid))-solution at 412 nm.

        <p>In the 13 C detected experiments for sequence specific assignment of N, C´, C α , C ß resonances at 310 K (2D CON, 3D (H)CBCACON, 3D (H)CBCANCO, 3D (HCA)COCON and 3D (H)CCCON)) [34,38,85] the 13 C carrier was placed at 174.5 ppm, the 15 N carrier at 123 ppm and the 1 H carrier at 4.7 ppm (H 2 O). Band selective 13 C pulses were applied at 174.5 and 39 ppm to excite or invert 13 C´ and 13 C ali spins respectively. The following bandselective pulses were used: 300 µs with Q5 and time reversed Q5 shapes for C´ and C ali excitation, 220 µs Q3 shapes for C´/C ali inversion/refocusing. Homonuclear virtual decoupling in the direct dimension was achieved through the IPAP approach. Detailed information about the acquisition parameters is provided (Table S1 andS2).
