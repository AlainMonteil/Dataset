        <p>The characterisation of individual nanoparticles by single particle ICP-MS (SP-ICP-MS) has paved the way for the analysis of smallest biological systems. This study suggests to adapting this method for single viruses (SV) identification and counting. With high resolution multichannel sector field (MC SF) ICP-MS records in SV detection mode, the counting of master and key ions can allow analysis and identification of single viruses. The counting of 2-500 virial units can be performed in 20 s. Analyses are proposed to be carried out in Ar torch for master ions: 12 C + , 13 C + , 14 N + , 15 N + , and key ions 31 P + , 32 S + , 33 S + and 34 S + . All interferences are discussed in detail. The use of high resolution SF ICP-MS is recommended while options with anaerobic/aerobic atmospheres are explored to upgrade the analysis when using quadrupole ICP-MS. Application for two virus types (SARS-COV2 and bacteriophage T5) is investigated using time scan and fixed mass analysis for the selected virus ions allowing characterisation of the species using the N/C, P/C and S/C molar ratio's and quantification of their number concentration.The characterisation of individual nanoparticles by single particle ICP-MS (SP-ICP-MS) has paved the way for the analysis of smallest biological systems.

        <p>Single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (SP ICP-MS) was first tested at Institute Forel, University of Geneva in 2001 and presented in 2002 at the EMRS Spring Meeting in a proceedings paper published by Degueldre and Favarger [1]. This method was later tested on gold nano-particles that are used as substrate in nano-pharmacy, and published subsequently i.e. Degueldre et al [2]. SP ICP-MS was also tested on dioxides e.g. Degueldre et al [3,4,5]. The characterisation of individual metallic nanoparticles by ICP-MS analysis has been carried out by laser ablation as reviewed by Koch and Günther [6] or by socalled single particle ICP-MS which has paved the way for the analysis of small biological systems like individual microscopic cells e.g. Zheng et al [7] and Corte-Rodríguez et al [8].Single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (SP ICP-MS) was first tested at Institute Forel, University of Geneva in 2001 and presented in 2002 at the EMRS Spring Meeting in a proceedings paper published by Degueldre and Favarger [1].

        <p>Today the challenge of very sensitive ICP-MS methods is to solve specific medical issues such as contaminations pathways or viruses spreading and the role of forgotten elements e.g. Te as pointed out by Amais et al [ 9]. This conceptual study suggests the use this method for single viruses (SV) ICP-MS identification and counting. Its potential is tested for two virus kinds: one of RNA and one of DNA type.Today the challenge of very sensitive ICP-MS methods is to solve specific medical issues such as contaminations pathways or viruses spreading and the role of forgotten elements e.g. Te as pointed out by Amais et al [ 9].

        <p>To perform SV ICP-MS high dilution of the viral sample suspension is required to inject one virus at a time in the plasma torch, producing one flash of ions per slot time of the Mass Spectrometer. After atomisation/ionisation in the plasma torch the flash of ion (cloud) passes through the conus pin hole and is analysed in the mass spectrometer. The number of flash is proportional to the concentration of viruses in the sample, and the intensity of the ionic flash is proportional to the fraction of the element (isotope ion) present in the viral object. For practical reason one considers the argon (Ar) plasma torch.To perform SV ICP-MS high dilution of the viral sample suspension is required to inject one virus at a time in the plasma torch, producing one flash of ions per slot time of the Mass Spectrometer.

        <p>In nanomedicine virus analysis is a key issue, however current molecular analysis is usually time consuming. In this study for virus identification one is interested to discriminate the fraction of master ions (atoms from the matrix of the virus) and the fraction of key element (ion from a coating e.g. drug, or from a selected element e.g. specific for given amino acid or for the viral RNA or DNA). In the case of a given virus, for example, SV ICP-MS shall require the selection of one (or two) master ion(s) and of 2 key ions to identify them and quantify their fraction in the virus 'body'.In nanomedicine virus analysis is a key issue, however current molecular analysis is usually time consuming.

        <p>In ICP-MS analyses the introduced sample is largely ionized in the plasma followed by a separation of the ions by their mass-to-charge ratio. A resulting ion beam is then quantified via calibration of the associated signal intensities. Usually the argon plasma is operated under atmospheric conditions and the analytes are transported there either in acidified (or basic) aqueous solution or in organic solvents, the most abundant elements in the plasma next to Ar are H, O, N, and C. To reduce contamination (C,N,O) the torch is placed in argon atmosphere.In ICP-MS analyses the introduced sample is largely ionized in the plasma followed by a separation of the ions by their mass-to-charge ratio.

        <p>A little intensity is lost through the process, but the gain is worth the loss: interference being drastically lowered, the collision/reaction cell's performance is at its best level. The advantages and disadvantages of ICP-MS is its very large range of analysis, however SV ICP-MS remains a non-species selective analysis.A little intensity is lost through the process, but the gain is worth the loss: interference being drastically lowered, the collision/reaction cell's performance is at its best level.

        <p>On the other hand, in a known matrix with a known analyte, a very accurate quantitation can be performed by the mean of a conversion factor for calculation of the species of interest. If a soluble or gaseous interferes in the scan signal (background), it can be reduced by dilution in the stream of pure water used in SV mode. The advantage of this method is the principle of analysis itself that gets rid of organic compounds that could interfere in other types of measurements by a digestion step (solid samples) and/or directly by the subsequent plasma ionization.On the other hand, in a known matrix with a known analyte, a very accurate quantitation can be performed by the mean of a conversion factor for calculation of the species of interest.

The key ion data allow by deduction identification of the virus based on its functionalities derived from specific amino acids present in the virus. In all case the concentration of the virus (in number per mL) can be deduced.For sulphur, three naturally stable isotopes ( 32 S, 33 S, 34 S) are found with an abundance of approximately 95% for 32 S. For the determination of trace concentrations, the only reasonable isotope is offered by 32 16 O While the interfering ion mass remains 32 amu for 16 O2. However, it must be kept in mind that although the analyte can then be analyzed at a mass different to its interfering species, the mass it is shifted to could be already be "occupied" by other analytes also present in the sample, e.g. 48 Ti + in the case of [ 32 S 16 O] + . In such cases, with a normal single quadrupole ICP-MS system, one would end up with the same problem, just at another mass. Interferences may also be avoided using high resolution MS. Un-labelled virus identification may consequently be done by measuring master ions and the key ions. The first give a weight of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen and could be used to derive a total mass (in Da) of the virus, on the basis of calibration. The oxygen data may be affected by the virus hydration grade. The key ion data allow by deduction identification of the virus based on its functionalities derived from specific amino acids present in the virus. In all case the concentration of the virus (in number per mL) can be deduced.</p>
        <p>Single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS) offers unique features for the detection of particles, as well as for their quantification and size characterization. The detection capabilities of SP-ICP-MS are therefore not only limited to the concentration domains (of particles and dissolved related species), but also to the mass of element per particle and particle size domains as reported by Degueldre &amp; Faverger (2003) and confirmed by Laborda et al [14]. Discrimination and detection of particle events, based on the use of robust limits of decision and the estimation of the limits of detection in the different domains, require standardized metrological approaches that have not been clearly established yet. As a consequence, harmonized approaches and expressions to allow reliable comparisons between methods and instruments, as well as to process SP-ICP-MS data, are required.Single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS) offers unique features for the detection of particles, as well as for their quantification and size characterization.

        <p>ICP-MS is a powerful method, unfortunately, the linear dynamic range of single particle analysis may be hindered by "unruly" transient signals and momentary pulse pile-ups at the electron multiplier detector see Rush et al [15]. This study investigated a way to extend the dynamic range of ICP-MS nano-particle quantification via addition of a collision gas in the collision cell of the ICP-MS. The collision gas temporally broadens the nano-particle signal resulting in decreased pulse pile-up and increased integrated intensity, up to a point where scattering losses begin to dominate. The addition of a collision gas used together with the dual mode detector shows a promising path forward towards mitigating unruly transient signals, improving the dynamic range of nano-particle quantification.ICP-MS is a powerful method, unfortunately, the linear dynamic range of single particle analysis may be hindered by "unruly" transient signals and momentary pulse pile-ups at the electron multiplier detector see Rush et al [15].

The counting of 2-500 virial units can be performed in 20 s. Application for two virus types (SARS-COV2 and T5 sipho bacteriophage) is investigated using time scan and fixed mass analysis for the selected virus ions allowing characterisation of the species using the N/C, P/C and S/C molar ratio's These points make the manuscript of great interest for the readers of Talanta.This study suggests to adapting this method for single viruses (SV) identification and counting.

        <p>To perform SV ICP-MS high dilution of the viral sample suspension is required to inject one virus at a time in the plasma torch, producing one flash of ions per slot time of the Mass Spectrometer. After atomisation/ionisation in the plasma torch the flash of ion (cloud) passes through the conus pin hole and is analysed in the mass spectrometer. The number of flash is proportional to the concentration of viruses in the sample, and the intensity of the ionic flash is proportional to the fraction of the element (isotope ion) present in the viral object. For practical reason one considers the argon (Ar) plasma torch.To perform SV ICP-MS high dilution of the viral sample suspension is required to inject one virus at a time in the plasma torch, producing one flash of ions per slot time of the Mass Spectrometer.

        <p>In ICP-MS analyses the introduced sample is largely ionized in the plasma followed by a separation of the ions by their mass-to-charge ratio. A resulting ion beam is then quantified via calibration of the associated signal intensities. Usually the argon plasma is operated under atmospheric conditions and the analytes are transported there either in acidified (or basic) aqueous solution or in organic solvents, the most abundant elements in the plasma next to Ar are H, O, N, and C.

        <p>On the other hand, in a known matrix with a known analyte, a very accurate quantitation can be performed by the mean of a conversion factor for calculation of the species of interest. If a soluble or gaseous interferes in the scan signal (background), it can be reduced by dilution in the stream of pure water used in SV mode. The advantage of this method is the principle of analysis itself that gets rid of organic compounds that could interfere in other types of measurements by a digestion step (solid samples) and/or directly by the subsequent plasma ionization.On the other hand, in a known matrix with a known analyte, a very accurate quantitation can be performed by the mean of a conversion factor for calculation of the species of interest.

        <p>ICP-MS is a powerful method, unfortunately, the linear dynamic range of single particle analysis may be hindered by "unruly" transient signals and momentary pulse pile-ups at the electron multiplier detector see Rush et al (2018) 15 . This study investigated a way to extend the dynamic range of ICP-MS nano-particle quantification via addition of a collision gas in the collision cell of the ICP-MS. The collision gas temporally broadens the nano-particle signal resulting in decreased pulse pile-up and increased integrated intensity, up to a point where scattering losses begin to dominate. The addition of a collision gas used together with the dual mode detector shows a promising path forward towards mitigating unruly transient signals, improving the dynamic range of nano-particle quantification.ICP-MS is a powerful method, unfortunately, the linear dynamic range of single particle analysis may be hindered by "unruly" transient signals and momentary pulse pile-ups at the electron multiplier detector see Rush et al (2018) 15 .

        <p>The single virus analysis challenge is to discriminate the C and N ICP-MS peaks from the virus from the C and N signal backgrounds. Clearly reduction of both background signals is possible working in a helium glove box (also required to avoid viral contamination) and using argon for the plasma torch with at least a seven 9 quality argon at least during sample injection. The argument C and N analysis by ICPMS is not possible is wrong this is due to the air contamination because ICP-MS analysis is traditionally carried out in atmospheric conditions. Actually C and N analyses are possible e.g. Riisom, et al (2018) 31 . Reduction of both C (CO2 and TOC) and N (N2) in the samples and ultra pure water used for dilution is mandatory. Interferences (see Table 2) need to be carefully assessed and reduced if any.

Interferences are analysed and discussed pointing out the need of SF-ICP-MS.
