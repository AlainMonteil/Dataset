        <p>Transfer hydrogenation is an extremely important tool in the fundamental transformations found in organic chemistry and is widely applied in current pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. 1 Generally, hydrogen-rich molecules such as alcohols, alkanes and hydrazines are used as the hydrogen donor toward hydrogenation of various unsaturated bonds. [2][3][4][5][6][7] On the other hand, water as the most widespread solvent and hydrogen source on earth, holds overwhelming advantages such as being non-toxic and low cost, and therefore can be a potentially ideal alternative for organic hydrogen donors. 8 Nevertheless, the H 2 O molecule is too stable to be activated and dehydrogenized under normal conditions (∆G 0 = +237 kJ/mol) and has barely been used for transfer hydrogenation.Transfer hydrogenation is an extremely important tool in the fundamental transformations found in organic chemistry and is widely applied in current pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. 1 Generally, hydrogen-rich molecules such as alcohols, alkanes and hydrazines are used as the hydrogen donor toward hydrogenation of various unsaturated bonds.

        <p>Hydrogen evolution by water splitting over photocatalysts is considered as one promising pathway for converting solar energy into chemical fuels. As a metal-free semiconductor, polymeric carbon nitride (CN) has been extensively studied in the last decade for photocatalytic water splitting owing to its visible-light response (E g = 2.7 eV), low cost and high accessibility to property modifications. [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] Since CN possesses a graphite-like 2D structure, it can be readily exfoliated via liquid-phase sonication or post thermal treatment, resulting in nanosheets with more exposed active sites and improved performance. [20][21][22][23] Noble metal nanoparticles, typically Pt, are usually loaded as cocatalysts to boost the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. H 2 is generated from Pt sites due to more favorable hydrogen elimination from intermediate Pt-H species, in comparison to the more difficult covalent elimination from a hydrogenated CN surface. 18 Pt is also an excellent hydrogenation catalyst for a variety of unsaturated organic compounds, such as carbon-carbon multiple bonds, nitro-and nitrile groups, carbonyl compounds, and also in general aromatics. [24][25][26] In this context, a feasible approach for achieving water transfer hydrogenation is to couple photochemical hydrogen evolution with a hydrogenation reaction, using e.g. Pt/CN as the catalyst. To our surprise, although Pt/CN has been well studied for water splitting and significant progress has been made, [27][28][29][30] it has been barely used for channeling the hydrogen from water to organic molecules.Hydrogen evolution by water splitting over photocatalysts is considered as one promising pathway for converting solar energy into chemical fuels.

        <p>Previous works have reported several materials (palladium/CN, Bi 2 MoO 6 ) for photocatalytic hydrogenation in water, [31][32] however, some problems remain unsolved in these works: the dearth of key measurements including action spectra and reaction kinetics for understanding the photochemical processes, the limited type of organic substrate and the lack of direct evidence of water being the hydrogen donor. Xiong and co-workers used PdPt/TiO 2 for photocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation with hydrogen sourced from water, nevertheless this photocatalyst was only UV light active due to the large bandgap of TiO 2 . 33Previous works have reported several materials (palladium/CN, Bi 2 MoO 6 ) for photocatalytic hydrogenation in water, [31][32] however, some problems remain unsolved in these works: the dearth of key measurements including action spectra and reaction kinetics for understanding the photochemical processes, the limited type of organic substrate and the lack of direct evidence of water being the hydrogen donor.

        <p>Herein, we have developed a tandem photocatalytic water-donating transfer hydrogenation (PWDTH) using Pt/CN as the catalyst, beyond its conventional utilizations for just single water splitting. Our design is exhibited in Scheme 1: CN acts as the light absorber and upon light illumination, the induced electrons transfer from CN to the Pt cocatalyst (Step 1), where water is reduced to hydrogen (H 0 , Step 2); the holes were captured by sacrificial agent (triethanolamine) to form oxidation products.Herein, we have developed a tandem photocatalytic water-donating transfer hydrogenation (PWDTH) using Pt/CN as the catalyst, beyond its conventional utilizations for just single water splitting.

Action spectra, femtosecond transient absorption spectra reaction and kinetic profiles were measured to shed light on the reaction mechanism. Isotope-labelling confirmed water being the hydrogen donor rather than any other hydrogen containing species. Much higher quantum efficiencies (up to 21.8%) were achieved than in conventional water splitting reactions. CN nanosheets were first prepared by water-assisted exfoliation of bulk CN, which was synthesized by heating the cyanuric acid-melamine precursor.

        <p>The Pt nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed (Figure 1a) and exposed a narrow size distribution in the range of 2-6 nm (Figure 1b). A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 1c) shows that Pt nanoparticles are tightly attached to the CN nanosheets. The fringe spacing of 0.226 nm can be ascribed to the (111) planes of face-centered cubic platinum. X-ray diffraction patterns show that the diffraction peaks from Pt become intensified with increased loading mass (Figure S1). The chemical state of the Pt nanoparticles was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in the XPS spectrum (Figure 1d), the deconvoluted peaks at 71.1 and 74.2 eV were assigned to the 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 orbitals of Pt 0 , respectively. 34 The shoulder peaks centered at 72.4 and 76.2 eV most likely indicate the presence of Pt in an oxidized state. 35 Moreover, to extend light absorption and improve the charge separation and migration, a carbon-rich molecule, barbituric acid, was co-polymerized with the cyanuric acid-melamine precursor, [36][37][38] resulting in a modified photocatalyst denoted Pt/CNB (3 wt% Pt loading, unless otherwise specified). The TEM observation and IR spectra are shown in Figure S2 andS3. The energy band structures of CN and CNB were determined by electrochemical Mott-Schottky plots and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As shown in Figure S4a, the positive slope of the linear plots indicated the typical n-type characteristic of samples and the derived flat-band potential for CN and CNB were -1.43 and -1.15 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively, suggesting that both materials are thermodynamically suitable for photocatalytic reduction of water (H + /H 2 : -0.59 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 6.6). [37] The band gaps (E g ) of CN and CNB were calculated according to their PL spectra as 2.68 eV and 2.43 eV, respectively (Figure S4b). Thus, the valence band top of CN and CNB was then determined as 1.25 and 1.28 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Figure S4b inset). As shown in the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure S5), the binding energy cut-off edge for CN and CNB was 17.17 and 17.01 eV, respectively, from which the work function of the two materials was calculated to be 4.05 and 4.21 eV, lower than that of metal Pt (Φ=5.64 eV) and Pd (Φ=5.22 eV). [39] The interaction between CN/CNB and metal nanoparticles under equilibrium (no light irradiation) was investigated by XPS. After the deposition of metal nanoparticles on CN/CNB, electron migration occurred from the CN/CNB supports to the metal nanoparticles until the Fermi levels are aligned. [40] This conclusion was verified by the XPS result: the Pt 4f peak in Pt/CN, Pt/CNB, and PtPd/CNB shifted to lower binding energy (up to Δ= 0.36 eV) compared to that of metallic Pt (Figure S6a).The Pt nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed (Figure 1a) and exposed a narrow size distribution in the range of 2-6 nm (Figure 1b).

        <p>Further, Near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the C K-edge and N K-edge was performed and the spectra were compared for CN and CNB samples with and without Pt loading. The N K-edge spectrum of CN (Figure 2a) shows two characteristic * resonances at 399.4 eV and 402.3 eV which have been previously assigned to antibonding (unoccupied) orbitals associated with the aromatic N (N-1) in the tris-s-triazine moieties and the bridging N (N-2) coordinated by three tris-s-triazine moieties, respectively. [41] The N K-edge spectra for Pt/CN, CNB and Pt/CNB exhibit very similar features, suggesting that the carbon nitride matrix is not disrupted by the metal loading and barbituric acid co-polymerisation, and the bonding environment of N remains largely intact. Figure 2b shows the C K-edge NEXAFS spectra. The sharp * resonance at 287.9 eV for CN is associated with the characteristic N-C-N coordination in carbon nitride matrix. In comparison, the * C=C resonance at around 285 eV is relatively weak without the appearance of the resonance associated with structural defects (~284 eV) which were commonly reported for carbon nitride, [41,42] confirming the structural quality of our sample. A shoulder at around 287.3 eV can be attributed to interlayer C-N bonds which ensures a high interconnectivity between CN layers facilitating fast electron/hole transport across the layers. The additional shoulder at 288.4 eV has been previously associated with C-N species in a N-doped carbon-rich lattice. [42] However, it could also contain Next, the performance of the PWDTH method was first evaluated toward C=C bond hydrogenation, and styrene was used as a model compound (the reaction scope will be discussed later). In a typical procedure, the Pt/CN powder, styrene and triethanolamine were dissolved in a mixed solvent (2 mL water/3 mL 1,4-dioxane), and then this mixture was irradiated under LED light (420 nm) in a N 2 atmosphere. The yield of the hydrogenation product, ethylbenzene, was determined by gas chromatography (GC) analysis (Figure 3a). As a control, no ethylbenzene was detected when bare CN was used. After the deposition of 1 wt% Pt nanoparticles on CN, an ethylbenzene yield of 33% was obtained, indicating Pt nanoparticles are the catalytic sites. The yield improved to 65% with 3 wt% Pt loading. Nevertheless, the yield dropped to 50% when Pt was overloaded (5%), most likely owing to the aggregation of excess Pt nanoparticles acting as recombination sites for the charge carriers. [43][44][45] Pt/CNB (3 wt% Pt) showed the optimal performance for the PWDTH process, achieving 99% ethylbenzene yield, agreeing with the above characterizations.Further, Near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the C K-edge and N K-edge was performed and the spectra were compared for CN and CNB samples with and without Pt loading.

        <p>where, n = 2 for C=C and C=O hydrogenation, and n = 6 for N=O hydrogenation, according to the reaction equations in Scheme 1. As shown in Figure 3c, the Pt/CNB catalyst demonstrated enhanced AQEs than Pt/CN across the whole UV-vis range, in accordance with the results of the hydrogenation yield. The enhanced photocatalytic activity for Pt/CNB partly resulted from the increased light absorption of the CNB support, by which more photons could be harvested and used in the hydrogen evolution step. Besides, a higher AQE was achieved at lower wavelengths for both catalysts, and an AQE up to 6.2% was achieved under 380 nm illumination. Notably, the AQEs matched better with the absorption spectrum of the CN support than that of the whole Pt/CN hybrid, indicating that although a strong absorption tail up to 650 nm (dashed red line) was enabled by the Pt nanoparticles, Pt only played a role in the chemical catalysis (Step 2 and 3, Scheme 1). The overall light-harvesting efficiency of the synergistic catalyst is determined by the CN support, which executes photon-toelectron conversion, the initial step of the whole PWDTH process. Besides, the impact of light intensity on the catalytic activity was also investigated (Figure 3d). As a reference, no hydrogenation product was detected in the dark. Higher reaction rates were observed when the light intensity was increased from 10 to 40 mW/cm 2 . The positive correlation between the reaction rate and the light intensity further verifies the light-driven nature of the catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy was employed to study the dynamics of the excited states and to better understand the performances of the above-mentioned materials. The 3D contour plots and global fitting results 46 from the fs-TA spectra of the Pt/CN sample are displayed in Figure 4a,b. The ground state bleaching signal (a negative absorption signal) of Pt/CN was observed in the range of 430 nm -600 nm (Figure 4a). The positive absorption feature in the visible and NIR regions (&gt; 650 nm) was primarily assigned to photogenerated electrons in the carbon nitride. 47 The global fitting results displayed in Figure 4b and Figure S7a provide three time constants of 8.7 ps, 270 ps and &gt; 3 ns, which can be assigned to the electron quenching by recombination with photogenerated holes, 48 shallow electron trap state and deep trapping states with relatively long lifetimes, respectively. 47 For the Pt/CNB (Figure 4c,d and Figure S7b), similar results were obtained, while the time constant of the recombination process is two times higher (15.6 ps) than that of Pt/CN, indicating much slower photogenerated electron-hole recombination in the Pt/CNB. The shallow electron trap state may be favourable to the charge transfer process due to its ability to temporarily trap electrons, 49 The PWDTH approach was then performed to N=O and C=O bonds, using nitrobenzene and benzaldehyde as the model substrates. As shown in Figure 5a, a 99% yield was achieved for nitrobenzene hydrogenation, with an AQE of up to 21.8% under 380 nm illumination, much higher than many carbon nitride-based photocatalysts for water splitting (Table S1). The corresponding action spectra are shown in Figure 5b, featuring similar behaviour as that of styrene (C=C) hydrogenation. However, the yield for benzaldehyde hydrogenation was only 17% under the same condition being applied. The action spectrum (Figure 5c) illustrates that the AQE was poor under all wavelengths (below 0.5%). These results can be interpreted that although Pt is able to catalyze a range of organic transformations, yet it is not an ideal catalyst for C=O reduction. 50 To solve this problem, palladium, a well-recognized catalyst for C=O reduction, 51 but less active in oxidation, was alloyed into Pt nanoparticles (Figure S8) to enhance the catalytic activity for hydrogenation. The resulting PtPd/CNB catalyst led to a 99% yield of the benzyl alcohol. Significantly improved AQEs were reached across the wavelength range (10.4% at 380 nm) and matched with the absorption spectrum of CNB (Figure 5c). Interestingly, alloying with Pd resulted in slightly improved activity for C=C hydrogenation, and in contrast, resulted in decreased activity for C=O hydrogenation (Figure 5a). Since H 0 is an intermediate product in the PWDTH process, monitoring the generation of H 0 will be very helpful to understand the reaction mechanism. To this end, the photocatalytic water splitting into H 2 gas was isolated by not adding the organic reactants. The amount of produced H 2 gas was measured and compared with that of the H 0 formed in the PWDTH process (converted into H 2 , calculated according to the amount of hydrogenation products). As shown in Figure 5d, more hydrogen was generated in the presence of styrene, nitrobenzene or benzaldehyde. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced for nitrobenzene, where the hydrogen reduction equivalents towards organic chemistry are 3 times higher than the realized hydrogen yield from isolated water splitting. The enhancement of hydrogen evolution in the presence of organic reactants should result from the below effects: (i) higher separation efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs with the organic reactants adsorbed onto the photocatalysts. As shown in the PL spectra (Figure S9), the emission intensity of Pt/CNB and PtPd/CNB decreased after the adsorption of organic compounds, implying enhanced photo-induced charge carrier separation, which is beneficial to the proton reduction in the hydrogen evolution reaction. (ii) The reduced protons (H 0 ) could be immediately captured by the adjacent organic reactants and consumed in the coupled hydrogenation reaction, avoiding the elimination process at metal surfaces to form H 2 molecules. Therefore, the presence of organic substrates should be kinetically beneficial to the formation of H 0 , which was the critical intermediate of the PWDTH process. A similar enhancement was reported by Jiang et al, in which hydrogen generation from ammonia borane was greatly accelerated when coupling to the reduction of nitro compounds. 52 The present observation is inspiring and highly important for the solar-to-fuel discussion, as the efficiency is easily improved by a factor of 3 when moving from hydrogen as an energy carrier to more rewarding organic chemicals.where, n = 2 for C=C and C=O hydrogenation, and n = 6 for N=O hydrogenation, according to the reaction equations in Scheme 1. As shown in Figure 3c, the Pt/CNB catalyst demonstrated enhanced AQEs than Pt/CN across the whole UV-vis range, in accordance with the results of the hydrogenation yield. The enhanced photocatalytic activity for Pt/CNB partly resulted from the increased light absorption of the CNB support, by which more photons could be harvested and used in the hydrogen evolution step. Besides, a higher AQE was achieved at lower wavelengths for both catalysts, and an AQE up to 6.2% was achieved under 380 nm illumination. Notably, the AQEs matched better with the absorption spectrum of the CN support than that of the whole Pt/CN hybrid, indicating that although a strong absorption tail up to 650 nm (dashed red line) was enabled by the Pt nanoparticles, Pt only played a role in the chemical catalysis (Step 2 and 3, Scheme 1). The overall light-harvesting efficiency of the synergistic catalyst is determined by the CN support, which executes photon-toelectron conversion, the initial step of the whole PWDTH process. Besides, the impact of light intensity on the catalytic activity was also investigated (Figure 3d). As a reference, no hydrogenation product was detected in the dark. Higher reaction rates were observed when the light intensity was increased from 10 to 40 mW/cm 2 . The positive correlation between the reaction rate and the light intensity further verifies the light-driven nature of the catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy was employed to study the dynamics of the excited states and to better understand the performances of the above-mentioned materials. The 3D contour plots and global fitting results 46 from the fs-TA spectra of the Pt/CN sample are displayed in Figure 4a,b. The ground state bleaching signal (a negative absorption signal) of Pt/CN was observed in the range of 430 nm -600 nm (Figure 4a). The positive absorption feature in the visible and NIR regions (&gt; 650 nm) was primarily assigned to photogenerated electrons in the carbon nitride. 47 The global fitting results displayed in Figure 4b and Figure S7a provide three time constants of 8.7 ps, 270 ps and &gt; 3 ns, which can be assigned to the electron quenching by recombination with photogenerated holes, 48 shallow electron trap state and deep trapping states with relatively long lifetimes, respectively. 47 For the Pt/CNB (Figure 4c,d and Figure S7b), similar results were obtained, while the time constant of the recombination process is two times higher (15.6 ps) than that of Pt/CN, indicating much slower photogenerated electron-hole recombination in the Pt/CNB. The shallow electron trap state may be favourable to the charge transfer process due to its ability to temporarily trap electrons, 49 The PWDTH approach was then performed to N=O and C=O bonds, using nitrobenzene and benzaldehyde as the model substrates. As shown in Figure 5a, a 99% yield was achieved for nitrobenzene hydrogenation, with an AQE of up to 21.8% under 380 nm illumination, much higher than many carbon nitride-based photocatalysts for water splitting (Table S1). The corresponding action spectra are shown in Figure 5b, featuring similar behaviour as that of styrene (C=C) hydrogenation. However, the yield for benzaldehyde hydrogenation was only 17% under the same condition being applied. The action spectrum (Figure 5c) illustrates that the AQE was poor under all wavelengths (below 0.5%). These results can be interpreted that although Pt is able to catalyze a range of organic transformations, yet it is not an ideal catalyst for C=O reduction. 50 To solve this problem, palladium, a well-recognized catalyst for C=O reduction, 51 but less active in oxidation, was alloyed into Pt nanoparticles (Figure S8) to enhance the catalytic activity for hydrogenation. The resulting PtPd/CNB catalyst led to a 99% yield of the benzyl alcohol. Significantly improved AQEs were reached across the wavelength range (10.4% at 380 nm) and matched with the absorption spectrum of CNB (Figure 5c). Interestingly, alloying with Pd resulted in slightly improved activity for C=C hydrogenation, and in contrast, resulted in decreased activity for C=O hydrogenation (Figure 5a). Since H 0 is an intermediate product in the PWDTH process, monitoring the generation of H 0 will be very helpful to understand the reaction mechanism. To this end, the photocatalytic water splitting into H 2 gas was isolated by not adding the organic reactants. The amount of produced H 2 gas was measured and compared with that of the H 0 formed in the PWDTH process (converted into H 2 , calculated according to the amount of hydrogenation products). As shown in Figure 5d, more hydrogen was generated in the presence of styrene, nitrobenzene or benzaldehyde. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced for nitrobenzene, where the hydrogen reduction equivalents towards organic chemistry are 3 times higher than the realized hydrogen yield from isolated water splitting. The enhancement of hydrogen evolution in the presence of organic reactants should result from the below effects: (i) higher separation efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs with the organic reactants adsorbed onto the photocatalysts. As shown in the PL spectra (Figure S9), the emission intensity of Pt/CNB and PtPd/CNB decreased after the adsorption of organic compounds, implying enhanced photo-induced charge carrier separation, which is beneficial to the proton reduction in the hydrogen evolution reaction. (ii) The reduced protons (H 0 ) could be immediately captured by the adjacent organic reactants and consumed in the coupled hydrogenation reaction, avoiding the elimination process at metal surfaces to form H 2 molecules. Therefore, the presence of organic substrates should be kinetically beneficial to the formation of H 0 , which was the critical intermediate of the PWDTH process. A similar enhancement was reported by Jiang et al, in which hydrogen generation from ammonia borane was greatly accelerated when coupling to the reduction of nitro compounds. 52 The present observation is inspiring and highly important for the solar-to-fuel discussion, as the efficiency is easily improved by a factor of 3 when moving from hydrogen as an energy carrier to more rewarding organic chemicals.</p>
        <p>The isotope effect on the reaction rate of the PWDTH process was investigated using H 2 O and D 2 O as the water source, respectively. In terms of the C=C and N=O hydrogenations, the reaction rate was almost the same using either H 2 O or D 2 O (Figure 6a,b). For C=O reduction, on the contrary, the rate was lower when D 2 O was used (Figure 6c). In combination with the above analysis on the action spectra, we can conclude that the overall reaction rates of C=C and N=O hydrogenation are rate-independent of hydrogen (proton) associated steps. Rather, the reaction rate is predominantly determined by the photo-induced charge separation and transfer within the CN. 53 For C=O hydrogenation, the catalytic rate is on the contrary limited by the hydrogen involved steps over the PtPd sites, such as bonds cleavage (H-Pd) and bonds formation (H-C, H-O) upon the metal nanoparticles. 7a,c). In a thermocatalytic reaction, the yields of organic transformations normally increase with temperature. 54 However, in a solar driven catalysis process, the separation and transport of the charge carriers can be inhibited due to more recombination at elevated temperatures. 45 Therefore, the C=C and C=O hydrogenations by the PWDTH approach suffered at higher reaction temperatures, resulting in decreased yields. On the contrary, the yields of N=O hydrogenation remained the same even at higher temperatures (Figure 7b). This performance should result from the strong coupling effect between nitro group and Pt nanoparticle after adsorption (Figure S10 and S11), 55 which endowed the catalyst capability to efficiently extract photo-induced electrons from CN (prior to recombination) even at elevated temperatures. The PWDTH system shows wide substrate compatibility. As listed in Table 1, different types of alkenes, and nitroaromatic compounds, as well as aromatic aldehydes with various substitution electron-withdrawing/donating groups, were hydrogenated in excellent conversion and selectivity (&gt;95% in most cases) under optimized conditions. For halide-substituted substrates (entry 5, 9, and 10), the reduction of halide groups (dehalogenation) was observed during the PWDTH process. As a result, the selectivity for these reactions was declined in comparison to that of using H 2 as the hydrogen source (the values in parentheses). Furthermore, the recyclability of the catalysts was evaluated. After simple washing and drying, the photocatalysts were reused in the next reaction cycles and only slight activity degradation was observed after five reaction runs (Figure S12), which might be owing to the loss or aggregation of the metal nanoparticles during reactions (Figure S13). 6 94/99 [a] The selectivity was calculated from the content of target product and detected side products. [b] The figures in parentheses give the selectivity when using gaseous H 2 as hydrogen source.

Interpretations of the action spectra suggest the overall light-harvesting efficiency was determined by the CN support, which executed photon-toelectron conversion, while Pt played its role as a (co)catalyst for the hydrogen evolution and hydrogenation.

High quantum efficiencies were obtained in the PWDTH processes, achieving up to 21.8% for nitrobenzene hydrogenation. Notably, the rate of hydrogen generation from water was facilitated by the sequential hydrogenation reactions, as compared to the isolated single water splitting reaction, indicating the PWDTH may be a more rewarding strategy than water splitting for solar harvesting. The specific catalytic hydrogenation performances of the C=C, N=O and C=O bonds were comparatively studied by action spectra and reaction kinetics, providing guidance for hydrogenations of other unsaturated bonds.
