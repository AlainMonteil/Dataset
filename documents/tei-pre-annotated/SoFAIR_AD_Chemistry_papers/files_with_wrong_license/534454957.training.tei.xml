        <p>Benzo [e][1,2,4]triazinyl, or Blatter radicals, are stable free radicals, first reported by Blatter in 1968. In contrast to their nitroxide counterparts, their properties can be modified more widely and more easily through simple substitution changes. This, together with recent developments in their synthesis, now places them at the forefront of developing applications in functional materials. Herein, we survey the various methods to synthesise and customise Blatter radicals, highlighting key developments in the last decade that have transformed their utility. We then outline their important spectroscopic, structural, electrochemical, magnetic and chemical properties and how these depend on their chemical structure and morphology. Finally, we review their growing list of applications including as sensors, spin labels, magnetic materials, liquid crystals and in polymer and small molecule synthesis.</p>
        <p>Radicals that are sufficiently long-lived to be purified and handled earn the special, catch-all moniker, stable. 1 In almost all examples of such compounds, the unpaired electron is resonance stabilised or sterically protected, being confined to a rigid, often lone-pair rich molecular backbone. Discussions on radical stability have been given elsewhere, 2 however we note that these properties stabilise the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) toward radical deactivation, with rare examples surviving decades under ambient conditions before noticeable degradation. Only relatively few classes of stable radicals have been reported since Gomberg's publication of the prototypical "persistent", i.e. visible by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), triphenylmethyl radical 1 in 1900 (Figure 1). 3 The nitrogen analogues, such as the commercially available salt 2, form radical cations which are among the simpler examples exhibiting bench stability. [4][5][6][7] This may be enhanced through steric protection or ùúã-system overlap into the adjoining arene substituents, 8 for example, the ether bridged species 3 9 and the elegant, sterically-protected analogue 4 (Figure 2). Arguably the most well-known family of stable radicals are the nitroxides (or aminoxyl radicals), which are of the general form R2NO ‚Ä¢ . Here, the unpaired electron resides in a œÄ* orbital centred on the NO moiety, resulting in a three-electron interaction exemplified in the two resonance structures of 5 shown in Scheme 1. Nitroxides are typically air-and moisturestable owing to the thermodynamic penalty of concatenated lone-pair rich atoms. Aliphatic species protected by quaternary ùõº carbons, such as (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) are particularly robust, 11 having found use as reporter molecules in EPR 12,13 and mechanistic studies, 14,15 catalytic oxidation, 16,17 polymer chemistry, [18][19][20] and more recently in organic batteries, 21,22 magnetic and "smart" materials, among others. [23][24][25][26][27][28] Scheme 1. Resonance stabilization of (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO).</p>
        <p>Although ubiquitous, nitroxides are certainly not the only class of stable radicals known to the literature. Rigid and fused hydrazyl radicals, in particular the verdazyl radicals (6,7) studied by Kuhn and Neugebauer [29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] and the conventionally named benzo[e] [1,2,4]triazinyl, or Blatter radicals (8), the subject of this review, are classic examples exhibiting exceptional allround stability (Figure 3). In both species, the unpaired electron is formally centred on a nitrogen atom within a rigid, nitrogenrich heterocycle. In reality, the SOMO is highly delocalised and therefore sensitive to substituent variations. This property alone is very advantageous, as simple structural modifications can have broad impacts on the ultimate behaviour of the radical. Blatter radicals have only gained traction in recent years but are now abundant in the broader scope of stable-radical chemistry. Herein we provide an overview of this progress, discussing preparative routes and derivatisation, basic properties and functional scope. Throughout the text, we make frequent use of radicals 9 and 10 (Figure 4). The synthesis and analysis of 10 is described in the Supporting Information, where readers will also find computational methodology and other aspects related to modelling undertaken in this report. As for existing literature, Koutentis and Constantinides have previously discussed Blatter radicals as part of an instructive book chapter, 37 whilst their role in devices and other technologies was very recently reviewed by Zheng et al. 38 Magnetic properties have also been described in a broader outline on the topic by Mukhopadhyay et al. 39 As usual, direction will be made to these articles when appropriate.</p>
        <p>Synthetic strategies for Blatter radicals have been developed sporadically since their discovery over fifty years ago to the date of this review. 40 Until recently, preparations were tedious and suffered from various inefficiencies that prohibited their widespread adoption. 31,32,[41][42][43] Thanks to the efforts of various researchers over the last decade, particularly those of Koutentis, Constantinides and Kaszy≈Ñski et al., [44][45][46][47][48][49] access to Blatter radicals has been greatly diversified and now a large library of compounds are known to the literature.</p>
        <p>The first known example of a Blatter radical was described by the eponymous author in a seminal 1968 paper, "A new stable free radical". 40 The compound in question, 1,3-diphenyl-1,4dihydrobenzo-1,2,4-triazin-4-yl, Blatter's radical (9), was prepared from a reactive 1,3,4-triphenyl-1,2,4-triazabutadiene, or azoimine, 11 (Scheme 2). 50 Upon acidification in hydrogen bromide, this intermediate rapidly cyclised to an isolable 1,4dihydro or leuco triazine salt 12. Quantitative aerobic oxidation to the radical was completed over several hours in ethanolic potassium hydroxide via 13, although various pathways were noted to form the desired product from the free base of 12.</p>
        <p>Scheme 2. Blatter's synthesis of the 1,3-diphenyl-1,4-dihydrobenzo-1,2,4-triazin-4-yl radical 9. 40 Several unspecified radicals were prepared from various azoimines using this methodology, including the 1-(p-tolyl)-6methyl analogue 17. In an effort to corroborate Scheme 2, this compound was also synthesised through an alternate pathway, shown in Scheme 3. Here, bromination of N',N'-di-(ptolyl)benzohydrazide 14 enabled selective nitration to 15. Simultaneous reduction of the nitro group and hydrodehalogenation was accomplished under hydrogenative conditions. The resulting amine 16 underwent a cyclodehydration to the leuco form in refluxing ethanol followed by aerobic oxidation under basic conditions to yield the radical 17 in low yield. Scheme 3. Blatter's novel preparation of the 1-(p-tolyl)-6-methyl analogue 17. 40 Shortly following the publication of Blatter's work, Huisgen and Wulff reported the preparation of the 7-methoxy analogue 21 (where R = OMe) via aza-Wittig chemistry (Scheme 4). 51 Here, the addition of diphenylnitrilimine 18 to N-(4-methoxyphenyl)imino(triphenyl)phosphorane 19 resulted in a complex reaction mixture from which a sparing (6%) yield of radical 21 was isolated. Huisgen identified this annulation as an electrocyclic mechanism requiring an intermediate azoimine, in this case generated by the elimination of triphenylphosphine. Scheme 4. Aza-Wittig-type approaches to Blatter radical synthesis. 51 Analogues of 21 (where R = Cl) also formed under an analogous addition of diphenylnitrilimine 18 to sulphur-based aza-ylides (20) in dichloromethane (Scheme 4). 52 Partial oxidation to radicals was noted during workup, with isolation of trace azoimine supporting the electrocyclic mechanism as proposed by Huisgen. Soon after, Magnus et al. observed predominately Blatter's radical 9 (24% yield) from the oxidation of disulphide 22 with nitrobenzene (Scheme 5). 53 The reactivity of 9 was studied in the context of a reductive ring contraction to the 1,2diphenylbenzimidazole 23. This useful transformation has since been generalised (see Section 2.3). Formation of 9 (74% yield) was also achieved from the addition of N-bromosuccinimide to N'-phenylbenzhydrazide phenylhydrazone 24, an amidrazone and precursor to the azoimine. Scheme 6. Proposed formation of Blatter's radical 9 by thermolysis of hydrazidine 26. 52 Blatter's radical (9) was later observed by Buzykin and Gazetdinova in their analysis of the various products resulting from the addition of diphenylnitrilimine 18, to benzaldehyde 2phenylhydrazone 25 in refluxing anisole (Scheme 6). 54 The minor product of this reaction, the hydrazidine 26, underwent thermolysis forming the intermediate azoimine 11, and the subsequent radical 9 under air. 41 Blatter radicals were not re-examined in great detail until Neugebauer and Umminger in the early 1980's, 41 who described a general preparation involving thermal cyclisation of the azoimine in dimethylsulfoxide, before further oxidation to the radical with metallic oxides (Scheme 8). Buzykin separately reported this transformation in refluxing anisole. 54 A number of new radicals were prepared under these conditions, including a series of 3-tert-butyl examples as well as a selection of deuterated analogues. Interestingly, oxidation of amidrazone (R = Ph) in boiling ethanol afforded Blatter's radical directly (51%), quite analogous to the one-pot transformation of this species reported by Magnus. 53 These conditions were not found to be generally applicable however (vide infra).</p>
        <p>Neugebauer's product-specific preparation of Blatter radicals suffered from several inefficiencies connected to isolation of the unstable azoimine. 41 This was often used in crude form, hampering efforts to boost the overall yield of the radical. Clearly, direct transformation from the amidrazone would resolve these problems and had already been shown for Blatter's radical in the presence of oxidants, 41,53 but this method was unable to access a broader scope of triazinyl radicals. Scheme 9. Koutentis's popular one-pot adaptation of scheme 8. 44 Koutentis et al. were the first to arrive at a solution. Screening a selection of oxidants and bases, they discovered that a combination of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU, 0.1-1 equivalents) and palladium-on-carbon (1.6 mol%) in air, facilitates a rapid conversion of amidrazones to Blatter radicals at room temperature (Scheme 9). 44 Unlike Neugebauer's method however, which relied on expensive or toxic metal oxidants and moderate heating, these comparatively mild conditions are more efficient, suffering very little over-oxidation to benzotriazin-7-ones (see Section 2.3). Palladium-on-carbon was initially selected for its catalytic role in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols. 58 This is known to be influenced by pH, 59,60 and deprotonation with a base would almost certainly expedite the oxidation of the amidrazone to an azoimine. Indeed, under an atmosphere of oxygen, various organic bases of comparable strength [DBU, pyridine, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP), triethylamine and ethyldiisopropylamine (H√ºnig's base)] enabled radical formation. Kaszy≈Ñski et al. later calculated that protonation of the azoimine decreases the rate-limiting electrocyclisation barrier by some ‚àÜ‚àÜùê∫ ‚Ä° = 15.4 kcal mol -1 (Figure 5). This would support the formation of radical products at room temperature in the presence of base. 57 Nevertheless, for reasons that are not understood, only DBU managed this transformation under an atmosphere of air and with unusual efficiency (with 98% yield of 9). Scheme 10. Synthetic approaches to amidrazones. 57 Amidrazones are typically prepared by substitution of an imidoyl chloride with an arylhydrazine, or a hydrazonyl chloride with an aromatic amine, the latter being preferred as it eliminates the requirement for regioselectivity in the penultimate step of the synthesis (Scheme 10). These compounds vary in their bench-stability and on silica gel, often requiring immediate use following purification so as to minimise degradation. Purification is critical here as the ultimate yield in radical is sensitive to the quality of the starting material.</p>
        <p>Scheme 11. Access to the nitroaryl-functionalised hydrazides 33, precursor to the reductive cyclodehydration method. 45 In the interest of avoiding these temperamental intermediates, Koutentis demonstrated a modification of Blatter's cyclodehydration method (Scheme 3). 45 Unlike Blatter's preparation however, which involved an inefficient protection strategy to selectively access the nitro-functionalised hydrazide 15, these key intermediates may be prepared directly by nucleophilic aromatic substitution of halide 31 with hydrazide 32, giving the coupled product 33 (Scheme 11). Although more general and efficient, some difficulty arose in the preparation of hydrazides with non-aryl substituents at Ar 2 . This limitation can be met with protecting group chemistry, however.</p>
        <p>Scheme 12. One-pot reductive cyclodehydration strategy of 33 to Blatter radicals. 45 Mild reduction of the nitro group of 33 followed by acidmediated cyclodehydration results in the oxidatively-unstable leuco triazine. Alternatively, this can be accomplished in one pot with excess (4 equivalents) metallic reducing agents to give 34, followed by cyclisation and oxidation to radical 35 (Scheme 12). Tin and indium were the most effective choices based on an optimisation screen, particularly in comparison to iron. In agreement with Magnus, 53 more aggressive metal reductants, such as zinc or copper, facilitated an irreversible, reductive ring contraction of the desired radical to a benzimidazole (as in Scheme 5).</p>
        <p>Scheme 13. Copper-mediated C-N coupling protocol toward radical 39. 46 Based on the work of Ma et al., 61 the transformation in Scheme 11 was later modified to a copper-mediated C-N coupling, with 2-iodoaniline 36 and hydrazide 37 (Scheme 13), thus avoiding the additional reduction step to reach amine 38. This adaptation is more compatible with alkyl groups at C3, eliminating the need for protecting group chemistry. For example, the 3trifluoromethyl radical 39 could be prepared in 80% yield, a marked improvement on the 37% procured via Scheme 11. 46 Scheme 14. Azaphilic addition of organometallic reagents to benzotriazines. 47 Functionalisation at the N1 position is ordinarily limited by the accessibility of the antecedent arylhydrazine. As a means to expand the substrate scope at this position, Kaszy≈Ñski et al. then explored the synthesis of Blatter radicals through the azaphilic addition of organolithium or Grignard reagents to benzotriazines 40 (Scheme 14). 47 Addition initially forms a stable triazinyl anion 41, which slowly oxidises to the radical upon exposure to air. Analysis of the Fukui functions supported regioselective addition to N1; 62 this was observed in all examples. Readers should note the slight instability of electronrich radicals on solid supports, for example the 7-methoxy species (Ar = 2-methoxyphenyl). Nevertheless, purification of this compound has been accomplished by direct crystallisation or through trapping of the anionic intermediate with electrophiles. 63 Scheme 15. Addition of phenyllithium to various 3-functionalised benzotriazines in Ref. 64 .</p>
        <p>Depending on the stability of the aryllithium reagent, it may also be necessary to generate this key component in situ, that is, through metal-halogen exchange or direct lithiation in tandem with azaphilic addition. Sensitive functional groups, such as halogens or competitive acceptors such as carbonyl-containing groups, are not expected to perform adequately in these systems, adding some limitations to the preparative scope of Scheme 14. This said, recent developments in benzotriazine synthesis has enabled access from 42 to a variety of novel, 3functionalised Blatter radicals (43, Scheme 15), 64,65 not easily accessible by any alternative method discussed here. Scheme 16. Intramolecular azaphilic addition to form planar Blatter radicals. 66 Planar radicals in which the aryl substituent at N1 is joined by a chalcogen bridge to C8, have also been prepared through an intramolecular version of this reactivity (Scheme 16). 66 After an initial lithium-halogen exchange, 8-(2-bromo)phenoxide and thiophenoxide-functionalised benzotriazines 44 undergo an intramolecular azaphilic addition to N1, forming the planar analogues of Blatter's radical (45). Alternate coupling mechanisms, including radical Pschorr-type annulation and a promising photocyclisation route have since been proposed (Scheme 17). 67,68 These strategies have greatly broadened the variety of planar radicals in the current literature. Scheme 18. Spontaneous transformation of nitron 30 to the 3-amidyl radical 32 in wet acetonitrile. 48 The rearrangement of 49 occurs through an initial hydrolytic ring opening to an N-formylated amidrazone 51. The exocyclic nitrogen appears to be essential here as a solution of 1,3,4triphenyl-1,2,4-triazolium tetrafluoroborate 53 (which ought to form Blatter's radical), remained unchanged under analogous conditions (Scheme 19). Further transformation to the radical might simply result from an intermediate azoimine, however the authors speculated that a hydrazonyl radical could also accomplish annulation. Interestingly, high water concentrations (50%) favoured the formation of the 3-anilino azoimine 54, also predominate in basic, degassed acetonitrile (Scheme 19). Thus, whilst the presence of water provides selective access to the Nformylated amidrazone, subsequent formation of the radical appears to be competitive with hydrolysis to 54, which does not undergo further conversion to radical 52. This implicates the key role of the formyl group in completing the transformation, possibly through a subtle inductive effect, although the exact reasons for this remain to be investigated in greater detail. Inspired by the pioneering work of Huisgen (Scheme 4), 51 Koutentis et al. finally re-examined the aza-Wittig pathway toward the preparation of Blatter radicals. 49 Rather than engaging a nitrilimine, diazenes (55) were identified as more reliable substrates for the synthesis of radicals in combination with N-aryl-imino(triphenyl)phosphoranes (56), generating radicals of the form 57 (Scheme 20). After the initial aza-Wittig reaction to form an azoimine, transformation to the radical presumably follows the electrocyclic mechanism of Figure 5. In many cases however, the high reaction temperatures needed to accomplish this step resulted in the appearance of benzotriazin-7-ones (Sec 2.3). This could be suppressed under air-free conditions, however the 4methoxyphenyl and 4-nitrophenyl derivatives (56, R = OMe, NO2) both gave mainly the over-oxidised species, despite efforts to eliminate oxygen. Excess iminophosphorane (up to 2 equivalents) was also found to improve yields in most examples, likely through limiting the competitive decomposition pathways of the diazene. These intermediates could not be prepared from acetyl, trifluoroacetyl and pyridine-2-carbonyl hydrazides, which oxidised to complex reaction mixtures, limiting scheme 20 to the synthesis of radicals 57 with aryl substituents at C3. 48 For the sake of brevity, tautomerisations and conformations are excluded from this scheme.</p>
        <p>Schemes 9, 18 and 20 ostensibly involve the in situ formation of an azoimine, the key component in the electrocyclic formation of Blatter radicals. Kaszy≈Ñski's modelling determined that this ought to be assisted by acid catalysis (Figure 5). One might then expect some improvement to Scheme 20 under such a modification, however no change was observed with Bronsted and Lewis acids in either catalytic (5 mol%) or stoichiometric amounts (100 mol%). Alternatively, ring activation could be conducted by a hydrazonyl radical 58 (Figure 6). Indeed, the isolation of azoimines does not preclude the intermediacy of this species. 48 Clearly, the formation of Blatter radicals from amidrazones is not fully understood and deserves further study.</p>
        <p>Benzotriazin-7-ones 59 are the most prevalent oxidation product of Blatter radicals. 69,70 Typically undesirable, their formation is essentially eliminated by placing non-labile substituents at C7, for example the "super stable" 7trifluoromethyl analogue of Blatter's radical. 71 Although a byproduct in the preparations described, these compounds have been shown to undergo selective addition of nucleophiles and electrophiles at C6 and C8, respectively. 72 This chemistry has been put to use in synthesis in a number of contexts, including towards medicinally relevant compounds. 73,74 More relevant however, is their use in the preparation of a series of heterolefused radicals of the form 60 (Scheme 21). 75,76 Scheme 21. Access to the œÄ -extended radicals (60) from benzotriazin-7-one 59. 75,76 Access to the leuco triazine is easily achieved with mild reducing agents such as ascorbic acid. 57 Most examples are of course unstable to molecular oxygen or mild oxidants (e.g. sodium periodate), rapidly reforming the radical on the bench. As mentioned previously, stronger reducing agents, i.e. metallic zinc, facilitate an irreversible, reductive ring contraction to a benzimidazole. This behaviour in radicals of the form of 61 has been optimised by Koutentis et al. as a route for accessing 1,2diphenylbenzimidazoles (62), 77 particularly the asymmetrical heterole-fused species for which alternate preparations are sparse. 78 Influenced by the early observations of Magnus et al., 53 radicals are heated to reflux in glacial acetic acid with excess zinc powder, forming the desired products in nearquantitative yields (Scheme 22). This reductive method (albeit from a relatively advanced precursor) complements the traditional strategies to form 1,2-disubstituted benzimidazoles, which are typically cyclocondensation or oxidative processes, or cross-dehydrogenative couplings. 79 Scheme 22. Reductive ring contraction of Blatter radicals (61) to 1,2diphenylbenzimidazoles (62). 77 Very few stable radicals are known to participate in palladiumcatalysed cross-coupling reactions. Among early reports were the Heck, Suzuki-Miyaura and Sonagoshira-type couplings of bromide and iodine functionalised nitronyl nitroxides, respectively. [80][81][82] Motivated by these results, Koutentis et al. were the first to explore the viability of halogenated Blatter radicals (63) as substrates in Stille and Suzuki-Miyaura-type reactions to access 64 (Scheme 23). 83 Readers should also note the recent extension of this chemistry to the verdazyl radicals, which are yet to experience equal success. 84,85 Scheme 23. Suzuki-Miyaura and Stille cross-couplings with Blatter radicals (note; other Pd catalysts and conditions were tested). 83 For the Stille reaction, yields up to 78-93% were achieved with the use of two equivalents of aryl stannane, whilst three equivalents of aryl boronic acid was most efficient for the Suzuki reaction, which also achieved yields of 67-93%. Naturally, not all substrates performed equally under the standard conditions; only moderate conversions or complex reaction mixtures were experienced with electron deficient boronic acids. However, these may prove to be feasible utilising alternative borane or catalyst combinations in future studies. Radical derivatives 65 and 66 have subsequently also been prepared using Suzuki-Miyaura and Stille reactivity, respectively (Figure 7). 86,87 In terms of general derivatisation, Kaszy≈Ñski's authoritative study on Blatter radicals is most instructive (Figure 8). 57 For the sake of completeness, we briefly describe some selected examples of this work here, but urge readers to address the full article for a deeper understanding of Blatter radical chemistry. Basic hydrolysis of benzoate functionalised radicals was first demonstrated by the rapid and quantitative deprotection of 67 to the bisphenol species 68 (Scheme 24). Alkylation was subsequently attempted with varying success on phenol derivatives under standard conditions. To this end, it was found that 68 reacted successfully with 1-adamantanecarbonyl chloride forming the diester 69 in 91% yield. Hydroxy substituents were also accessible through hydrogenation of the corresponding benzyl ether, with the use of both options giving scope for orthogonality. Furthermore, carboxylic acidfunctionalised radicals were obtainable by hydrolysis of the corresponding methyl esters.</p>
        <p>Scheme 24. Ester hydrolysis of 67 to the bisphenol radical 68 and subsequent esterification to 69. 57 Building on the work of Koutentis et al., 83</p>
        <p>The UV/Vis absorption profile for dilute Blatter radicals typically consists of one major absorption in the UV region, followed by a sequence of minor adsorptions trailing into the visible region (Figure 9). Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations have been conducted by several authors in order to characterise these features. 57,64,88 While the major absorption in the UV region can be attributed to a predominately HOMO-1 to LUMO transition, the SOMO to LUMO transition is barely visible in most examples due to its low oscillator strength, a result of poor SOMO-LUMO overlap. Fluorescence emission studies of Blatter's radical 9 have also been conducted by Itskos and Hayes et al. 88 Under UV (270 nm) excitation in the solution phase, a strong and narrow emission band was measured at 350 nm. This mirrors the major absorption observed at this wavelength (Figure 10). Interestingly, broad, stoke shifted features in the visible region was observed under excitation between 430 and 550 nm, indicative of internal conversions to the LUMO prior to emission. Most noteworthy here was the broad white-light emission measured under ~370 nm excitation, a rare property among organic molecules useful in the design of light-emitting devices. 89 Some work is needed to improve its fluorescence quantum yield in the visible region however, with the authors noting that derivatisation could offer recourse. Time-resolved fluorescence decay with 500, 590 and 650 nm excitation was subsequently measured for 9 in the solution and solid phases. These indicated average lifetimes of 2-3 ns in dichloromethane, with greater variation in thin films (1.5-5 ns) and shorter lifetimes in 50:50 radical:polymethylmethacrylate blends (1-1.5 ns). Optical properties relating to the unpaired electron typically diminished in solutions or films above a certain concentration. This effect can be attributed to dimer radical aggregation and should be manageable with steric modifications to 9. Incidentally, these studies indicated dichloromethane as the best solvent choice for this species.</p>
        <p>EPR studies of Blatter's radical were initially conducted by Neugebauer and Kadirov in the 1980s. Beyond conventional continuous-wave (CW-EPR) measurements, 42 isotope labelling, double electron-nuclear resonance (DENR), 90 electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and triple resonance spectra have been obtained for 9. 43 Few other radicals have been studied in similar detail. These include the 3-tert-butyl (10) 43 and the 1-(4nitrophenyl) analogues. The spectral composition of Blatter radicals is primarily characterised by seven principle lines, consistent with coupling of the unpaired electron to three nearly equivalent quadrupolar 14 N nuclei (Figure 11). In terms of hyperfine coupling constants (hfcc), the greatest share in spin-density generally resides at N1, followed by N4 then N2, in no particular order. The presence of spin-active heteroatoms, typically at C3 and C7, causes further splitting in the resultant spectrum. For example, the 7-trifluoromethyl radical 75 (Figure 12) is characterised by twelve principle lines as opposed to seven, resulting from additional hyperfine coupling (3.45 G) to three equivalent 19 F nuclei. 71 A similar effect is observed in the 3-trifluoromethyl analogue, only with a smaller hfcc (1.89 G), 45 whilst the effect at N1-Ar tends to be negligible given that the substituent is essentially perpendicular to the heterocycle (note: a considerable increase is observed in the planar radicals studied by Kaszy≈Ñski et al.). The properties described can be rationalised from the basic topology of the SOMO, recently imaged by Kondo resonance mapping (Figure 12). 92 Since the orbital is predominately delocalised over the benzotriazine but possesses a node at C3, the result is the accumulation of very little spin density in the 3substituent, such that its influence is largely a result of both spin polarization and the stability of the dipolar resonance contributor B (Scheme 27). 57 Kaszy≈Ñski has discussed and correlated these substituent effects previously. 64</p>
        <p>The crystal structure of Blatter's radical and countless other species can be found on online databases. 93 In general, the amidrazonyl moiety adopts a planar or near-planar geometry with the fused arene, presumably driven by resonance stabilization of the unpaired electron. Aryl substituents at C3 are close to coplanar with the benzotriazine, whilst steric interactions between the peri hydrogen H( 6) and the ortho position at N1 result in large torsional angles often greater than 50Àö. Many Blatter radicals form columns of dimers described by an inversion in the orientation of the N1 substituent along the stacking direction (see Figure 13). A veritable subset of these possess an additional symmetry element in the form of a centre of inversion, resulting in the appearance of two distinct centrosymmetric radical dimers. Recent studies by Kaszy≈Ñski et al. have added new, more complex structures to the library, such as the 1-pyrenyl radical 76, which forms sheets of double homo-co-facial œÄ-œÄ dimers (Figure 14). 96 These discoveries further realise the role of the N1 substituent, 97 particularly its steric demands, in dictating the packing arrangements characterising the polycrystalline phase.</p>
        <p>Few focussed studies have been made on the specific decomposition pathways of Blatter radicals. Nevertheless, some general comments are possible with reference to the conditions under which they have been exposed. Like nitroxides, Blatter radicals rarely dimerise and are generally stable to molecular oxygen and water, hence the label of stable.</p>
        <p>Except for certain electron-rich examples, they are also unreactive to silica-gel chromatography and therefore purifiable using standard techniques. Reproduced with permission from Ref. 71 . Copyright (2011) American Chemical Society.</p>
        <p>Blatter radicals exhibit exceptional thermal stability in the solid and the solution phases (Figure 15), 71 with decomposition onsets measured all the way up to 400 ÀöC. 98 They are also excellent traps for carbon-centred radicals, exhibiting Gibbs free bond dissociation energies of the order of 100 kJ mol -1 or more at 298 K at the N4 position. 99,100 As seen in studies of controlled radical polymerization (Section 4.5), this trapping only becomes partially reversible above 100 ¬∞C. 101,102 Although there is a clear preference for radical coupling to N4, N2 regioisomers have been reported as far back as Neugebauer. 41,103 These species are less stable in general, 47 readily decomposing under heat or light exposure.</p>
        <p>Unlike the verdazyl or nitroxide radicals, 104,105 no dedicated study of basic Blatter electrochemistry has been added to the literature. This said, since it is common to perform voltammetric measurements in characterising new and existing species, abundant data has been produced over the years and the behaviour is well-understood. 45,49,64 Blatter radicals undergo at least one reversible oxidation and one reversible reduction event (Figure 16). Consistent with Kaszy≈Ñski's observation of the thioaminyl radicals, 106 these radicals being delocalised, exhibit narrow cell potentials (Ecell = |Eox¬∞ -Ered¬∞|) of around 1 V. Two unusual exceptions can be found in the 1,3-bis(pyrid-2-yl) radical 77 and the 3-(4nitrophenyl) radical 78, which endure two reversible oxidation and reduction events, respectively. The former case has been attributed to a spurious dimeric species (Figure 17), 107 whilst the latter corresponds to a follow-up reduction of NO2, which, due to its disposition, does not directly participate in the initial reduction of the radical (vide infra).</p>
        <p>Figure 17. Most Blatter radicals exhibit one reversible oxidation and one reversible reduction event, one accidental and one real exception are illustrated here. 45,49,107 The stability of the "12œÄ" anion and the "10œÄ" cation is highly sensitive to substituent effects, as is the radical. For example, Koutentis et al. tabulated a variation of 600 mV in the oxidation half-wave potentials and 360 mV in the reduction half-wave potentials across the various products of Scheme 19. 49 Typically, functionalisation of the C3 or C7 positions greatly influences both redox events as compared to Blatter's radical, whilst effective modification to the aromatic group at N1 is also known. 49 Interestingly, simultaneous functionalisation at C3 and C7 is considerably synergistic (Figure 18), revealing a structure that could play host to captodative effects by placing donor and acceptor groups at these opposing positions. It is possible to correlate substituent effects with redox potentials by considering their respective Swain-Lupton resonance (ùëÖ), and field/inductive (ùêπ) parameters. 109 Similar analyses with Hammett parameters have been performed previously. 64 To illustrate this case, Table 1 depicts this correlation for simple analogues of Blatter's radical in dichloromethane (Figure 19). For substituents at C7, considering either parameter in isolation yields no useful correlation (R 2 &lt; 0.75), suggesting that the overall influence is a combination of the two. Indeed, scanning the ratio of ùëÖ and ùêπ, excellent agreement ensues from mixed ratios of close to one-to-one. Similarly, a slight preference for ùêπ appears to be optimal at N1. This presumably stems from the high N1-Ar torsional angle with respect to the benzotriazine, which invariably reduces the opportunity for resonance stabilisation onto this group. 1. Linear regression modelling for reduction potentials of Blatter radicals against the modified Swain-Lupton parameters (ùëÖ and ùêπ) of their respective substituent choices.</p>
        <p>Here we have constrained ùë• + ùë¶ = 1 with the accuracy of the resultant fit given by R 2 . The importance of each position to the reduction potential is roughly accounted for by the slope of the model, given in the right most column. All relevant data for this table can be found in the Electronic Supplementary Information.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, whilst the reduction potential due to C3 is most closely correlated with the ùêπ parameter only, the oxidation potential is subject to both effects. This discrepancy is immediately resolved by appealing to the topology of the SOMO and ionic HOMO surfaces, depicted in figure 20. Clearly, the anionic HOMO and radical SOMO both share a node at C3, explaining the importance of the through-space interactions to reduction. Conversely, the cationic HOMO is delocalised into the substituent resulting in resonance stabilisation of the positive charge, hence a contribution from ùëÖ.</p>
        <p>Owing to their extraordinary stability under ambient and exertive conditions, Blatter radicals have been considered in an ever-broadening variety of applications. These were discussed at length in Zheng's recent review which we revise briefly here. 38</p>
        <p>Historically, Blatter's radical was first reported as forming a pressure-sensitive charge transfer salt in combination with the electron acceptor, tetracyanoquinodimethane; these properties being fully reversible. 98,110 The pyrene-backed radical 81 is a known sensor for picric acid, which undergoes a stark colour change from purple to green (82) upon protonation in acetonitrile (Figure 21). 111 This species has also been closely examined for surface chemistry applications based on the high vapour pressure of pyrene. For example, highly air-and vacuum-stable magnetic thin films have been deposited on phosphorous-doped SiO2 surfaces by organic molecular beam deposition, 112,113 whilst a copper-based surface was identified as a potential organic molecular quantum bit. 114 Figure 21. Functional analogues of Blatter's radical. 111,115,116 Other functional modifications to Blatter's radical have since been reported, including the 3,7-dithiomethyl analogue 83, synthesized for gold adhesion in single-molecule junctions 92,115 and the novel diamagnetic linker based on radical 84. 116 This latter example was integrated into a copper based metalorganic framework (MOF) series, [Cu2(TPTA)1-x(84[-4H])x], modulating its magnetic properties. Much like Kuhn-type verdazyl radicals, 117 Blatter radicals have also been identified for all-organic, rechargeable batteries, 118 where there is a palpable need for substrates possessing highly-stable oxidation states. 119,120 Currently unexplored is their capacity as spinprobes by floursence or EPR. 121 For example, oxoverdazyls and nitroxides are known to exhibit substituent-dependent profluorescence upon trapping of carbon-centred radicals. 122- 124 We expect some scope for Blatter radicals in this respect.</p>
        <p>Stable organic radicals have long been studied as potential building blocks for molecule-based magnetic materials. 125,126 As with other applications, historically the literature has been more focused on nitroxide-based structures on account of their abundance and accessibility. 127,128 With the introduction of new gram-scale preparative methods, interest in Blatter-based magnetism has emerged from this trend. Readers will find a recent review by Mukhopadhyay et al. to be most useful on this topic. In a pioneering report by Neugebauer et al., variabletemperature magnetic susceptibility (œá) measurements of Blatter's radical demonstrated typical Curie-Weiss behaviour over 7-300 K, with weak antiferromagnetic radical-radical coupling prevalent below 7 K. 129 Similar behaviour was observed in its 3-tert-butyl analogue 10 whilst the susceptibility of a 1-(4-chlorophenyl) species, 85 reached a broad maximum at 138 K, before rapidly descending due to the onset of notable short-range antiferromagnetism (Figure 22). In this case, a modified alternating, antiferromagnetic Heisenberg linear chain model proved a more appropriate fit. 129 Estimated exchange parameters of J1 = -76.5 cm - 1 and J2 = -22.9 cm -1 were determined in Ref. 130 .</p>
        <p>Of course, the magnetic behaviour in the solid phase depends intimately on the crystal structure of the internal species (Section 3.3). 131,132 In the case of radicals 9 and 10, the unpaired electrons are essentially encased between the mostly closedshell C3 substituents of adjacent radicals in the œÄ-stack (see Figure 13). This explains the incidence of paramagnetism up to ambient temperatures. By comparison, radical 85 forms chains of centrosymmetric dimers in which neighbouring benzotriazine moieties overlap (Figure 23). Such an arrangement welcomes the opportunity for exchange coupling interactions, hence a departure from simple Curie-Weiss behaviour.</p>
        <p>Figure 24: (Left) œÄ-stacking in columns of radical 80, where "d" is the shortest interplanar distance and "œÜ" is the longitudinal slippage angle, hydrogens removed for clarity. 133 (Right) Selected examples with respective geometric parameters d, œÜ and magnetic exchange interaction J are given beneath each figure. 134 Due to the preference for columnar œÄ-stacking in polycrystalline Blatter radicals, many examples are known to express unusual forms of low-dimensional magnetism. [135][136][137] For example, compounds such as the 3,7-bis(trifluoromethyl) radical 80, which stack without N1-Ar inversion, tend to exhibit weak, long-range intrachain interactions but weaker (typically antiferromagnetic) interchain interactions. This results in essentially unidirectional magnetism of the form of a 1D Heisenberg linear chain (Figure 24). 133,134,138 The ultimate geometric and electronic factors governing the sign of the intrachain coupling is difficult to generalise however, but appears to involve the inter-planar separation as well as the slippage angles (principally the longitudinal) between successive radicals in the column. This in turn dictates the extent and character of the overlap between adjacent magnetic orbitals. 135 Of course, larger coupling constants are usually observed with small interplanar distances, the more subtle geometric feature being that large longitudinal slippage angles (&gt;45¬∞) can be characteristic of ferromagnetic (positive J) interactions, 111 antiferromagnetic (negative J) interactions viceversa. 139,140 The magnetic properties resulting from dimeric columns of Blatter radicals are more diverse and interesting due to the additional structural parameters. 87 Of course, due to the added structural complexities describing these morphologies, comparatively complex magneto-structural models must be fitted such that generalised statements become difficult. 63 These are usually low-dimensional in character however (Figure 25). 130,141 Figure 26. Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility œáT of radical 79 upon cooling from 300 K (Blue) and heating from 5 K (Red). This transition involves an increase in the interplanar separations of 0.14 and 0.08 √Ö for d1 and d2, respectively (following conventions illustrated Figure 19), with changes in longitudinal slippage angles (œÜ1 and œÜ2) of +7.4 and -2.3 degrees, between 5 and 75 K. 46 Assuming a Bleaney-Bowers model for interacting pairs of half-integer spins, 142 this modest transformation results in a large increase in the predicted dimer exchange interaction J1 (from a significant antiferromagnetic value of -184.8 cm -1 to a slight ferromagnetic value of +4.1 cm -1 ) along with a minor increase in J2 (from -8.3 to +7.0 cm -1 ), resulting in essentially paramagnetic behaviour above 75 K. Reprinted with permission from Ref. 46 . Copyright (2014) American Chemical Society Of particular note in the literature on Blatter magnetism is the 3-trifluoromethyl radical 79. 46 Solids of this compound were found to exhibit a reversible and abrupt, first-order phase transition, from a low-temperature diamagnetic phase to a high-temperature paramagnetic phase at 58 K (Figure 26). Computational modelling supported a two-step dimeric mechanism, described by population of the triplet-excited state at ~ùëá"/$ , followed by modest structural relaxation of the triplet dimer. 143 Following this line of thinking, some effort has been made to develop a radical exhibiting this behaviour only at ambient temperatures or indeed, under alternate stimuli. 144</p>
        <p>The organometallic prospects of Blatter radicals are as usual, understudied by comparison to other species. Hexafluoroacetylacetone (hfac) complexes of divalent 3d transition-metals with the bipyridyl-like radical 90 were initially studied by Morgan and Koutentis et al. in the interest of developing metal-radical magnets. 145,146 Mn II , Fe II , Co II , Cu II and Ni II species were prepared in a simple addition of the metal II (hfac)2 dihydrate to a stoichiometric quantity of 90 in chloroform at room temperature (Scheme 28). The resultant M(90)(hfac)2 complexes could be purified by crystallization for yields of 30-60%, completing what is a simple but very adequate synthesis. It is worth noting here that the amidrazone precursor was prepared from a thioamide as opposed to the usual route through a hydrazonyl/imidoyl chloride (Scheme 10).</p>
        <p>Scheme 28. Preparation of the metal-hfac complexes of 3-(pyrid-2-yl) radical 90. 145,146 The binding mode of 90 was found to be bidentate in all species, resulting in pseudo-octahedral complexes of varying distortion. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements supported by computational modelling was carried out to determine their basic magnetic properties. To this end, the Mn II and Fe II complexes exhibited strong antiferromagnetic metal-radical coupling down to low cryogenic temperatures (&lt; 30 K), whilst the Cu II and Ni II complexes behaved ferromagnetically in this respect. Radical-radical interactions were generally poor, particularly for Mn II and Fe II , an observation rationalised by the limited opportunity for intermolecular SOMO-SOMO overlap apparent in their crystal structures (Figure 27). Non-negligible spin-orbit coupling prevented a similar deconvolution of the antiferromagnetic Co II complex, although a glance its structure would suggest similar traits. Recently, the first bis(triazinyl) metal salt, [Cu(92)2](ClO4)2 ‚Ä¢ MeOH was reported (Figure 28). 147 This new tetrahedral complex exhibited all-round antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, whilst the hfac complex Cu(92)(hfac)2, like its analogous complex of 90, exhibited substantial ferromagnetic metal-radical coupling (J = +199 cm -1 ). Zn II , Ni II and Co II hfac complexes of 92 were later examined, however a transition metal complex exhibiting high-dimensional or long-range magnetic properties remains elusive. Finally, the first lanthanide complex Dy(90)(tbacac)3 (tbacac = 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato) has been described by Morgan et al. as a case study for single-molecule magnets (Figure 28). 149,150 This compound, like the transition-metal species described above, is air and water stable, but by contrast, displays long-range, three-dimensional antiferromagnetism and slow relaxation mechanics. Computational considerations ruled out significant metal-radical and radical-radical interactions, leaving dipolar coupling between Dy III ions as the major factor behind its novel magnetic behavior.</p>
        <p>Among the more bespoke uses for Blatter radicals has been in the study of liquid-crystalline (LC) materials, recently reviewed by Kaszy≈Ñski et al., who has largely driven this work. 151 Following the latest preparative methods, Blatter radicals have been integrated into various mesogenic architectures, including discotic [152][153][154] and photoconductive bent-core structures 155,156 (Figure 29). In general, discotic mesogens adopt a columnar hexagonal phase below 80 ÀöC, whilst bent-core mesogens form a Smectic A phase above 110 ÀöC. The magnetic behaviour these phases is naturally controlled by this structuring and hence, the molecular geometry. For instance, half-disc mesogen 93 exhibits strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions whereas the full-disc mesogen 94 is weakly ferromagnetic, with paramagnetic properties appearing at higher temperatures in the LC phase. Similarly, bent-core mesogen 95 forms nearly ideal paramagnets in the solid and LC phases, presumably due to steric barriers preventing SOMO-SOMO overlap thus isolating the radical centres.</p>
        <p>Some of the most compelling research in stable radical chemistry has been in the development di-and polyradicaloids. 157 These compounds, which possess thermally accessible spin states of use in magnetic materials and molecular electronics applications, have seen healthy progress in recent years, particularly now as the theory and design of such species has matured. [158][159][160] Figure 30. TPHA-1 (96) and its idealised "push-pull" adaption 97, illustrating the effect on ‚àÜE !-# in kcal mol -1 (Middle). Details on the modelling can be found in Ref. 161 .</p>
        <p>The earliest compounds involving Blatter radical moieties were the tetraphenylhexaazaanthracene's (TPHA), of which so-called TPHA-1, 96 is the best-known example (Figure 30). 98,162,163 This benzo-fused analogue of Blatter's radical exists as an exceptionally stable zwitterion, defined by its large singlettriplet energy gap (‚àÜE %-' ) of -20.1 kcal mol -1 . Redesigns and analogues of TPHA, such as 97, have been proposed to reduce this veritable barrier, 161 however no example possessing a ground-state triplet have been realised thus far. A large number of fused-and bridged-triazinyl polyradicals have also been reported over the years. [166][167][168][169] These compounds have numerous uses as discussed by Zheng et al. 38 Of particular note here is diradicaloid 98, an excellent, near-infrared photodetector which exhibits doublet character in the solution phase but forms unusual, stable quintet dimers in the solid state. 165 Computational modelling revealed a small singlettriplet gap (‚àÜE %-' ~1.0 kcal mol -1 ), leading the authors to posit that favourable exchange coupling in the dimer is responsible for a high-spin configuration accessible at room-temperature (Figure 31). 170 Further studies by the Zheng lab has extended the library of back-to-back bridged and fused Blatter diradicaloids, which now includes analogues of Chichibabin's 99 and M√ºller's hydrocarbons 100, 171 as well as tetraphenylethylene-bridged (101 and 102) and nitrogenbridged (103 and 104) species (Figure 32). 172,173 All of these examples exhibit an open-shell singlet ground state but a thermally accessible triplet excited state. This apparent preference for antiferromagnetism in bridged diradicaloids now has computational precedence. 174 With the ultimate goal of developing an all-organic ferromagnet, polyradicals possessing a stable high-spin ground state are the most sought-after but rarest examples in the literature. 175 The Rajca group has prepared a handful of remarkable Blatter-based diradicals with stable triplet ground states, achieved through the attachment of an iminonitroxide or nitronyl nitroxide co-radical (Figure 33). 176 These diradicals are stable in air at room temperature, however examples of the robust nitronyl nitroxide moiety enjoy higher thermal decomposition onsets (&gt; 160 ÀöC under an inert atmosphere). The most recent addition 106, 177 an evolution of 105, has an ‚àÜE %-' of ‚â• 1.7 kcal mol -1 , synonymous with 98% triplet occupancy at room temperature. 176,177 (Bottom) Proposed oxoverdazyl-bridged Blatter diradical modelled in Ref. 178 . ‚àÜE !-# and triplet occupancy given below each example.</p>
        <p>The difficulty in designing high spin polyradicals is compounded by the often desire to establish long-range interactions in polycrystalline solids and films. Here, 106 is unusual in so far that is forms antiferromagnetic one-dimensional chains in the polycrystalline phase, with a coupling constant of J π/k = -14 K being "by far strongest among all studied 1D S = 1 chains of organic radicals". Some work is also required to develop the theory and preparation of air-stable, triplet diradicals suitable for device fabrication, for example, by evaporative methods. Currently, 105 and 106 are the only known examples which have been thermally sublimed under ultra-high vacuum with near full retention of diradical character. Rigorous calculations on a series of analogous diradicaloids has pointed to compounds based on for example, an air-stable oxoverdazyl 107, which may well satisfy these needs. 178</p>
        <p>Much like nitroxides and verdazyls, Blatter radicals are excellent traps for carbon-centred radicals and, due to their high radical stability, this trapping becomes partially reversible at high temperatures (ca. &gt; 100 ¬∞C). As a result, Blatter radicals could in principle be harnessed to control radical polymerization by limiting the concentration of carbon-centred propagating radicals, relative to the number of dormant trapped species. In this way radical-radical termination can be minimised with respect to chain growth (Figure 34). Two studies interested in the capacity of Blatter radicals as mediators for controlled radical polymerization have been reported. Initial attempts to thermally polymerise styrene in the presence of Blatter's radical and select analogues were generally successful, with reasonable control achieved at 125 ¬∞C (polydispersity 1.2 for molecular weights up to 14 kg mol -1 ). 101 High control was also observed in the polymerization of various styrenic and acrylate (co)polymers with unimolecular Blatter-initiators, 102 however no improvement over conventional nitroxide-based mediators has been demonstrated thus far. This said, the inherent tunability of Blatter radicals may well come as an advantage in more bespoke photo-and electro-induced polymerizations, both of which have curried great interest in recent literature. 179- 183 Figure 34. Control equilibrium in Blatter-mediated radical polymerization, illustrated using Blatter's radical as the control agent for a generic polymer PN.</p>
        <p>Another possible synthetic application of the carbon-centred radical-adducts of Blatter radicals is in oxidative cleavage. As context, theoretical and experimental studies have shown that TEMPO-based alkoxyamines can undergo oxidative cleavage to either nitroxide radicals and carbocations, or oxoammonium cations and carbon-centred radicals, according to the stability of the leaving carbocation or carbon-centred radical. [184][185][186] When the leaving group is not stable in either form, the oxidation is reversible unless a nucleophile is present, in which case cleavage is driven by an SN2 process. 187 This chemistry can be used to afford in situ methylation with high yield and broad scope. 188 Although experiments have yet to be reported, highlevel theoretical calculations have shown that Blatter radicals also undergo oxidative cleavage, and because they undergo oxidation at considerably lower potentials than alkoxyamines, they offer the opportunity to broaden the functional group tolerance of this chemistry (Figure 35). 99,189 Figure 35. Behaviour of Blatter radical adducts under oxidation and their potential applications as radical sources, carbocations and methylating agents. 99,189</p>
        <p>Previously an object of curiosity, Blatter radicals have enjoyed vigorous development over this last decade. Several new synthetic strategies, at least three of which are generally applicable, have been added to the literature, with numerous options for derivatisation also being demonstrated. These tools, along with new computational insights, has opened the door to the new frontiers of rational design, leading to the preparation of numerous "tailor-made" compounds which meet the needs of the latest technologies in materials chemistry. Already, Blatter radicals are finding applications in magnetic materials, as sensors, spin labels and liquid crystals. They have even been proposed as potential qubits in quantum computing and have developing applications in polymer and small molecule synthesis. With their high stability, ease of preparation and functionalisation, diverse and tuneable properties, their use in functional materials is set to expand.</p>
