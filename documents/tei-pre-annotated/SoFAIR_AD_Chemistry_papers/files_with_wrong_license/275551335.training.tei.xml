        <p>A major drawback with microemulsions is the high surfactant and/or co-surfactant composition, which may make them potentially toxic upon administration. Therefore nanoemulsions can be an alternative as they share most of the good qualities of microemulsions-(apart from being thermodynamically unstables) -and can be formed at surfactant concentrations lower than required in microemulsions.A major drawback with microemulsions is the high surfactant and/or co-surfactant composition, which may make them potentially toxic upon administration.

        <p>One important aspect in the fabrication of nanoemulsions is the application of external energy to break the kinetic energy barrier of the immiscible components (oil and water). The energy applied should exceed the positive free energy of oil and water while in contact and the use of low frequency ultrasound (20 kHz) is justified by its ability to generate the required intense disruptive forces exceeding the forces that hold the droplets into spherical shape (Leong et al., 2009). The particle size of nanoemulsions tends to decrease as the ultrasonic intensity increases and tend to be more stable and less polydispersed with the use of ultrasound.One important aspect in the fabrication of nanoemulsions is the application of external energy to break the kinetic energy barrier of the immiscible components (oil and water).

        <p>One major drawback of high-energy methods is that less than 0.1% of the mechanical energy is utilized for the emulsification (Tadros et al., 2004).

        <p>Phase inversion temperature (PIT) was firstly reported by Shinoda and Saito (1969) which depends on the surfactant's solubility changing from aqueous to oily phase with temperature and involves the mixing of oil, water and nonionic surfactant (such as polyethoxylated surfactants) at room temperature with gentle stirring. A two-step process for the formation of finely dispersed emulsions for cosmetic use, with long-term stability, was described by (Wadle et al., 1993).Phase inversion temperature (PIT) was firstly reported by Shinoda and Saito (1969) which depends on the surfactant's solubility changing from aqueous to oily phase with temperature and involves the mixing of oil, water and nonionic surfactant (such as polyethoxylated surfactants) at room temperature with gentle stirring.

        <p>One key aspect in the fabrication of nanoemulsions by PIT method is the utilization of high surfactant-to-oil ratio (SOR) to prepare the microemulsion base which will be used later to form the nanoemulsion by cooling and dilution at room temperature. The stability of nanoemulsions is a major challenge and are thermodynamically unstable even closer to the demixing line of microemulsions but kinetically stable systems (Delmas et al., 2011b). Factors such as the control of particle size distribution, the incorporation of stabilizers such as Ostwald ripening retarding agent or by using a suitable emulsifier type to prevent coalescence are employed to improve kinetic stability.One key aspect in the fabrication of nanoemulsions by PIT method is the utilization of high surfactant-to-oil ratio (SOR) to prepare the microemulsion base which will be used later to form the nanoemulsion by cooling and dilution at room temperature.

        <p>It is reported that supersaturated vehicles can enhance drug absorption by the skin with high thermodynamic activity (Kemken et al., 1992). In this regard, microemulsions present a vehicle with decreasing water solubility for lipophilic molecules as the amount of water increases, which is the case during the preparation of nanoemulsion by the dilution method. Secondly, the drug incorporated within primary microemulsion can undergo in vitro crystallization very slowly after the preparation, which could take up to 10-14 days with no crystal observed within the first 2-3 days after formation of the supersaturated systems (Kemken et al., 1992).It is reported that supersaturated vehicles can enhance drug absorption by the skin with high thermodynamic activity (Kemken et al., 1992).

        <p>In preliminary experiments, it was found that a system composed of lipids other than oleic acid and coconut oil formed cloudy and unstable emulsions and they were discontinued from further investigations. In addition to that oleic acid and coconut oil were chosen due to their safety profiles, potential penetration enhancing activity and their use in cosmetic formulations (Viljoen et al., 2015).

        <p>To determine the solubility of loratadine in lipids, we adopted the method reported by Patel and co-workers (Patel et al., 2012). 50 mg of loratadine was transferred into a mortar maintained at temperature of 10 °C above the melting point of the lipid (~85 °C), and the lipid (oleic acid and coconut oil) was added gradually in increments of 50 mg and mixed, till loratadine was completely dissolved. The amount of lipid required to solubilize loratadine was noted by visualizing the disappearance of drug crystals and formation of a transparent homogeneous system and this was recorded (Cirri et al., 2018).To determine the solubility of loratadine in lipids, we adopted the method reported by Patel and co-workers (Patel et al., 2012). 50 mg of loratadine was transferred into a mortar maintained at temperature of 10 °C above the melting point of the lipid (~85 °C), and the lipid (oleic acid and coconut oil) was added gradually in increments of 50 mg and mixed, till loratadine was completely dissolved.

        <p>Different lipids were screened for potential use in the preparation of nanoemulsions. In each experiment, different amounts of loratadine were dissolved incrementally in hot melted lipids to determine the amount of lipid required to solubilize the drug to its saturation solubility to achieve drug-enriched core nanoemulsions (Mishra et al., 2018) as shown in Table 1. Drug supersaturation occurs during cooling of the nanoemulsion and causes precipitation of the drug before the precipitation of lipid. This results in the precipitating lipid to surround the precipitated drug, forming a membrane around incorporated drug (Mishra et al., 2018). Loratadine solubility was found to be maximum in stearic acid, followed by oleic acid, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, coconut oil, beeswax and carnuba wax. However, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol and carnuba (data not published) failed to produce stable nanoparticles.Different lipids were screened for potential use in the preparation of nanoemulsions.

        <p>Blank and drug loaded nanoemulsions were prepared by two methods which involved different order of mixing and homogenization using the lipids screened and Tween 60, Span 60 and Tween 80 at three different ratios of lipid to surfactant 1:5, 1:7 and 1:10 and the composition for the various formulations are shown in Table 2. The amount of lipids was determined by the drug solubility in the lipids (Lopes, 2014) and the solubilization capacity of a given amount of surfactant to incorporate the maximum amount of oil (Rao and McClements, 2012). High amounts of lipids beyond 10% (w/w) increases the viscosity of the dispersion and decreases the efficiency of homogenization which leads to high particle size and PDI, resulting in particles agglomeration and therefore nanoemulsion instability (Mehnert W, 2001). The total amount of oil phase including the drug (CSat) in this study was 0.3-1.5% (w/w), to assure good solubilization capacity by surfactant, small particle size and long stability as well as to ensure the formation of transparent solutions (Rao and McClements, 2012). To achieve an optimal particle size, Tween 80 was chosen and its concentration determined based on the preliminary solubilization experiments taking into consideration that the total surfactant concentration should be non-irritant and safe for transdermal application.Blank and drug loaded nanoemulsions were prepared by two methods which involved different order of mixing and homogenization using the lipids screened and Tween 60, Span 60 and Tween 80 at three different ratios of lipid to surfactant 1:5, 1:7 and 1:10 and the composition for the various formulations are shown in Table 2.

        <p>Tween 80 (C17E20) is a polysorbitate with an ethylene oxide backbone of w + x + y + z= 20 providing the hydrophilic nature. The oleate moiety (CnHn2n-1, C17H33) of polysorbate 80 contains a double-bond forming a kink in the hydrocarbon chain providing the hydrophobic nature. Tween 80 has a CMC of 0.012-0.015 mM and the presence of additives may affect the temperature dependence of a nanoemulsion containing a CmEn surfactant. To asses this effect, the cloud point (CP) is used to determine the transition from a homogeneous micellar solution into two isotropic solution phases, one of which is rich in surfactant and the other is surfactant-poor, and is detected by an increase in the turbidity of the solution (Machado et al., 2012). Two scenarios are possible upon the use of additive. Firstly, if the CP of a CmEn surfactant increases, it means that the additive interacts with the surfactant aggregates, whereas a reduction in the CP suggests that the additive is depleted from the micellar pseudo-phase (Machado et al., 2012). This behavior will be helpful in solubilizing lipophilic moieties through the generation of w/o phase. It is important to confirm the presence of this behavior during the formulation as it will have an impact on the PIT.Tween 80 (C17E20) is a polysorbitate with an ethylene oxide backbone of w + x + y + z= 20 providing the hydrophilic nature.

        <p>Increasing surfactant concentrations had the same effect on the PIT as on the CP. This is useful to estimate the PIT from CPs of nonionic surfactants in the absence of hydrocarbons. Based on the data, the PIT emulsification process was kept at a constant temperature range between 75-85 °C to ensure the formation of bicontinuous microemulsion (Engels et al., 1995). At those high temperatures, the interfacial tension decreases and the amount of surfactant molecules adsorbed at the o/w interface increases gradually until saturation is achieved (Yu et al., 2012). Cooling was done as part of phase inversion composition (PIC) method by the dilution of microemulsion with water to bring the temperature to 30 °C below the PIT to obtain nanoemulsions that are stable and avoid coalescence (Chuesiang et al., 2018).Increasing surfactant concentrations had the same effect on the PIT as on the CP.

        <p>The usual experiment involves adding water to an oil/surfactant mixture at constant temperature (PIT = 85 °C). A representative example of a typical conductometric experiment is reported in Fig. 4 and three regions can be identified. Upon initial addition of water (&lt; 10% H2O), there was an initial increase in conductivity which is attributed to hydration of the surfactant head groups and increasing their mobility (Chiappisi et al., 2016). As φw is additionally increased (~20% H2O), the first droplets of water in oil are formed in which loratadine gets solubilized, resulting in an overall decline in κ, where its peak decline indicates the start of the electrical percolation line. After another addition of water content at ~30% H2O, the microemulsion droplets swell until the initial concentrate of bicontinuous microemulsion is formed (Wang et al., 2008) and is represented by a sudden and sharp rises in κ, which indicates that the percolation has been threshold reached. The same transparent electrically conducting one-phase microemulsion was observed at 90 °C by (Wadle et al., 1993). However, as soon as the phase transition to the nanoemulsion phase takes place and o/w nanoemulsions are formed, κ increases only moderately with increasing water (~70% H2O) which was characterized as single, slightly shining blue and milky nanoemulsions.The usual experiment involves adding water to an oil/surfactant mixture at constant temperature (PIT = 85 °C).

        <p>The mechanism for the formation of nanoemulsion by PIC approach (Tirnaksiz et al., 2010) suggested the following events: (i) upon the first addition of water, water droplets will form in the continuous oil phase and (ii) further addition of water changes the spontaneous curvature of surfactant. The system starts as w/o microemulsion passing through bicontinuous structure, after which the water droplets merge and then decompose into smaller droplets upon further increase in the water content. From the point of view of phase inversion by temperature, raising the temperature leads to the dehydration of surfactant, triggering the formation of a w/o emulsion.The mechanism for the formation of nanoemulsion by PIC approach (Tirnaksiz et al., 2010) suggested the following events: (i) upon the first addition of water, water droplets will form in the continuous oil phase and (ii) further addition of water changes the spontaneous curvature of surfactant.

        <p>In both methods of preparation, the nanoemulsion was prepared by a two-step phase inversion that involved water dilution at the in the final stage, in a proportion of 1:5 (final water concentration was at 96-98%) to form the nanoemulsion. Well-defined phase inversion methods previously reported did not use total amount of surfactant above 10% (Tirnaksiz et al., 2010). Smaller particle size was also linked to higher water content, and thus offer better stability (Solè et al., 2012). The dilution is important for two reasons, firstly microemulsions have high concentration of surfactant (up to 15% in our experiments) which is not favorable from the regulatory point of view (Chen et al., 2015) and secondly to ensure the formation of nanoemulsions with good kinetic stability (Wooster et al., 2008).In both methods of preparation, the nanoemulsion was prepared by a two-step phase inversion that involved water dilution at the in the final stage, in a proportion of 1:5 (final water concentration was at 96-98%) to form the nanoemulsion.

        <p>However, the order of mixing had no significant effect (p &gt; 0.05) on the particle size, in method 1, with the particle size increasing as the surfactant concentration increased in contrast to method 2 in which the particle size decreased as the surfactant increased. In both methods, the droplet size appeared to be constant within 20% of water dilution. The findings are consistent with data reported by Solè et al.

The data showed that the use of phase inversion emulsification method at 80 -95 w/w % water can result in the formation of emulsions with droplet size below 40 nm and independent of the water content as reported by Morales et al.(2003).

        <p>We suggested the use of Ultra-Turax homogenizer instead of simple mechanical stirring in this method because this would create a high hydrodynamic shear tool around or above the PIT in order to extend the microemulsion or bicontinuous structure domains and to ensure all the oil phase was completely solubilized, therefore yielding a fairly monodispersed system (Roger et al., 2010). In our study, we did not obtain nanoemulsions having smaller droplets size below 100 nm when we used simple mechanical stirring compared to Roger et al.

        <p>Loratadine entrapment was analyzed using HPLC and the EE in nanoemulsions ranged from 99.30 % to 65.02 % as shown in Table 4. For the same surfactant ratio, changing the lipid type had significant effect (p &lt; 0.05) on drug entrapment. It is noteworthy that the amount of loratadine in all formulations was set at the saturated level shown in Table 1, because beyond these concentrations, nanoemulsions will break. Nanoemulsions with oleic acid showed better drug loading and it can be explained that the amount of oleic acid is enough to solubilize loratadine compared to the amount of coconut oil.

        <p>The solubilization capacity was generally high for any water content at higher temperature. As the temperature increased the solubility of the ethoxylated surfactant decreased and which is because the mixture will be hydrophobic so that its packing at the interface will be looser, allowing more drug molecules to be integrated at the interface (Garti et al., 2006).The solubilization capacity was generally high for any water content at higher temperature.

        <p>In terms of surfactant concentration, it was expected that increasing surfactant content would improve oil solubilization of nanoemulsion droplets. In Method 1, the particle diameter relatively increased as the surfactant concentration increased (Guttoff et al., 2015). This may be attributed to the order of mixing which involved the preheating of oil and water phases under Ultra-Turax homogenization, followed by ultrasonication and dilution with water. The use of high surfactant concentration can help the transport of nanoemulsion droplet via micelles, which may drive droplet growth by Ostwald ripening and coalescence (Rao and McClements, 2012).In terms of surfactant concentration, it was expected that increasing surfactant content would improve oil solubilization of nanoemulsion droplets.

        <p>Ultrasound might have helped to overcome the influence of high surfactant concentration on droplet growth by reducing the contact between the nanoemulsion droplets and micelles as suggested by Rao and McClements (2012). The application of ultrasound is known to form nanoemulsions of small particle size with narrow distribution by two mechanisms not offered by other mechanical devices-, which are (a) droplet disruption and (b) droplet coalescence. The former mechanism is governed by the type and amount of shear force applied to droplets and their resistance to deformation which is determined by the surface tension (Li and Chiang, 2012). The latter mechanism, droplet coalescence, results from the surfactant's capacity to adsorb onto the surface of newly formed droplets. This depends on the surface activity and concentration of the surfactant (Li and Chiang, 2012).Ultrasound might have helped to overcome the influence of high surfactant concentration on droplet growth by reducing the contact between the nanoemulsion droplets and micelles as suggested by Rao and McClements (2012).

        <p>In light of the aforementioned mechanisms, Method 1 was performed by the application of ultrasound on heated undiluted emulsion during the phase inversion (w/o to bicontinuous structure) by temperature approach (step 1). At this point, the amount of shear force applied to droplets (droplet disruption) was less efficient to disrupt the droplets, as the propagation medium of ultrasonic waves is predominantly oil. As a result, the droplet coalescence mechanism will prevail and surfactant adsorption ability decreases, which triggers more coalescence even in the presence of higher Tween 80 concentrations.In light of the aforementioned mechanisms, Method 1 was performed by the application of ultrasound on heated undiluted emulsion during the phase inversion (w/o to bicontinuous structure) by temperature approach (step 1).

        <p>On the other hand, in Method 2, the emulsion was first diluted at a temperature above the PIT and then sonicated. This allowed the system to invert from a w/o to an o/w nanoemulsion upon dilution and offering the ultrasound waves a better medium to propagate and disrupt the droplets. In the presence of high surfactant concentration and surface activity of 100% (Table 3), the nanoemulsion will give high surfactant adsorption capacity and prevent particles from coalescing.On the other hand, in Method 2, the emulsion was first diluted at a temperature above the PIT and then sonicated.

Cumulative amount of loratadine permeated after 24 h through pig skin from nanoemulsions prepared with oleic acid as oil phase showed an increase in the enhancement ratio with increasing surfactant concentration and decreased as the surfactant increased.

        <p>OA-7 and OA-10 nanoemulsions showed a decreasing ER of 11.5 and flux of 1.05 µg/cm 2 /h, and 19.6 and a flux of 1.78 µg/cm 2 /h respectively and the permeation was not significant between OA-7 and OA-10 (p &gt; 0.05). This is consistent with the work by Yuan et al. (2010) who reported that there is a plateau surfactant concentration beyond which the drug permeation will decrease. As a result, there was only a minor effect of surfactant concentration on the mass transfer coefficients in oleic acid nanoemulsions. These formulations also had the highest EE%, which is one of the factors affecting permeation.OA-7 and OA-10 nanoemulsions showed a decreasing ER of 11.5 and flux of 1.05 µg/cm 2 /h, and 19.6 and a flux of 1.78 µg/cm 2 /h respectively and the permeation was not significant between OA-7 and OA-10 (p &gt; 0.05).

        <p>The same behavior was observed when coconut oil was used as an oil phase. Fig. 8b showed no significant difference between the resultant fluxes (p &gt; 0.05) and this may be attributed to the insignificant difference (p &gt; 0.05) among the obtained particle sizes for these formulations. CO-5 flux was 0.65 µg/cm 2 /h followed by 0.58 µg/cm 2 /h and 0.25 µg/cm 2 /h for CO-10 and CO-7 respectively while the enhancement ratios were 7.1, 2.7, and 2.1 respectively. Changing the surfactant ratio did not show any significant enhancement in loratadine permeation (p &gt; 0.05) which means the possible penetration enhancement effect of Tween 80 is not mainly responsible for the improved skin delivery neither had a significant effect on particle size. In contrast, increasing Tween 80 concentration in both oils reduced the drug permeation which might be attributed to the increased packing of surfactant as its concentration increases and in turn hinder the drug release from the system (Kogan et al., 2008).The same behavior was observed when coconut oil was used as an oil phase.

        <p>Nanoemulsions prepared with coconut oil generally showed less permeation in comparison to those made with oleic acid. This may be due to the structure of coconut oil consisting of higher levels of short chain saturated fatty acids such as lauric acid (makes up about 50% of the fatty acids in coconut oil). These fatty acids have insufficient lipophilic characteristics to actively permeate the stratum corneum, thus, rendering poor penetration (Viljoen et al., 2015). These sets of nanoemulsions with coconut oil of moderate permeation enhancement compared to oleic acid proved that the latter has a role in improving the loratadine permeation through the skin. Oleic acid exerts its penetration enhancing activity via a distinctive feature of cis double bond at C9 which bends the alkyl chain and disturbs the SC lipid bilayers (Abd et al., 2018).Nanoemulsions prepared with coconut oil generally showed less permeation in comparison to those made with oleic acid.

        <p>Moreover, nanoemulsions with oleic acid showed high loading capacity (near saturation) compared with coconut oil nanoemulsions. This observation is consistent with the work done by Land et al.(2006) who reported that systems with near saturation leads to a great enhancement in mass transport. This near saturation may undergo supersaturation from microemulsions during occluded application and forms an additional driving force with small nanoparticles as reported by Kemken et al. (1992). It was also observed that drugs tend to become supersaturated in the microenvironment upon dilution and grow into crystals (Aserin and Garti, 2005). We suggest that this effect plays a pivotal role in enhancing the drug permeation from those nanoemulsions containing oleic acid at high surfactant concentrations (OA-7 and OA-10) and coconut oil nanoemulsions (CO-5, CO-7 and CO-10).Moreover, nanoemulsions with oleic acid showed high loading capacity (near saturation) compared with coconut oil nanoemulsions.

        <p>However, all nanoemulsions showed improved skin drug permeation in vitro that can be via different mechanisms and loratadine crystallization in nanoemulsions does not affect drug permeation. There are three potential mechanisms for increased delivery of loratadine from nanoemulsions as suggested by Abd et al. (2018): (i) increased solubility of the drug in the applied nanoemulsions; (ii) improved uptake of the vehicle carrying the drug into the SC; and (iii) a direct impact on the SC membrane properties, such as enhanced fluidization of the SC lipids.However, all nanoemulsions showed improved skin drug permeation in vitro that can be via different mechanisms and loratadine crystallization in nanoemulsions does not affect drug permeation.

        <p>Loratadine is practically insoluble in water (0.0134 mg/mL) (DrugBank, 2019). The solubilization capacity of loratadine substantially increased to 45 times in the nanoemulsion formulations containing a combination of oil phase (oleic acid and coconut oil), surfactant, and aqueous phase compared to the saturated aqueous solution. This effect was pronounced with oleic acid nanoemulsions than the one noted with coconut oil due to the high solubility of loratadine in oleic acid nanoemulsions and this increased solubility had an impact on the nanoemulsion uptake into the SC.Loratadine is practically insoluble in water (0.0134 mg/mL) (DrugBank, 2019).

        <p>Another strategy to explore the enhancement mechanisms of skin permeation was to determine the Jmax, the maximum flux of the aqueous saturated solution, as it is known that Jmax depends only on the thermodynamic activity of the solute in the vehicle, provided the vehicle or solute does not change the membrane characteristics (Zhang et al., 2013). It is noted that the Jmax value was low for the aqueous saturated solution of loratadine (Figs. 8a &amp; b), however, in contrast, Jmax values for nanoemulsions were much greater than for control. This proves that the nanoemulsions changed the SC barrier properties. It is well known that oleic acid and lauric acid (main component of coconut oil) enhance skin permeation by disrupting SC lipid (Osborne et al., 1991).Another strategy to explore the enhancement mechanisms of skin permeation was to determine the Jmax, the maximum flux of the aqueous saturated solution, as it is known that Jmax depends only on the thermodynamic activity of the solute in the vehicle, provided the vehicle or solute does not change the membrane characteristics (Zhang et al., 2013).

        <p>The appearance of nanoemulsions was translucent to the naked eyes as shown in Fig. 1. Cryogenic TEM was used to observe the droplet size in the nanoemulsions and the size was correlated with the data obtained from droplet size analysis using light scattering. Cryogenic TEM showed short features visible which can be described as parts of small vesicles or intact vesicles in the range of 50 nm. In addition, there were only small micelles in the range of 10-20 nm and were monodisperse (Aserin and Garti, 2005), thus confirming the hydrodynamic diameter of micelles obtained by DLS in section 3.4 as shown in Figs. 9a &amp;b. These observations support the postulation by Rao and McClements (2012) for the presence of Regime II where the Csat of the oil is reached and results in a mixture of swollen micelles and nanoemulsion droplets. Fig. 9b showed the presence of spherical micelles. The same observation was reported by Garti et al. (2004) and was attributed to the higher concentration added of guest molecule in the system which causes a more concave curvature toward the oil. In our study, the loratadine concentration was between 25-50% of the oil phase for oleic acid and coconut oil, respectively.The appearance of nanoemulsions was translucent to the naked eyes as shown in Fig. 1.

        <p>The stability of nanoemulsions is an important measure that dictates the shelf life of a given formulation. The stability of the optimized nanoemulsions was tested during storage at room temperature and at cold temperature for six months as shown in Table 6. For the freshly prepared systems containing oleic acid and Tween 80, there was initially a decrease in mean particle diameter from around 62 to 43 nm (1:5), 63 to 33 nm (1:7) and 50 to 31 nm (1:10) over the first three days of storage. The same behavior was observed with coconut oil nanoemulsions. This effect indicates that oil droplets have been fully solubilized within the Tween 80 micelles for an extended period as suggested by Rao and McClements (2012). The decrease in the droplet size is clearly a transient regime of Ostwald ripening as suggested by Nazarzadeh et al. (2013) and is independent of the nature of the change. The ability of Tween 80 to enhance the stability of the colloidal dispersions can also be explained to its capacity to produce repulsive steric forces between the colloidal particles owing to its comparatively large head group size. From the other point of view, we suggest the fabrication of nanoemulsions using different phase inversion approaches with short application of ultrasound promoted long-term stability.The stability of nanoemulsions is an important measure that dictates the shelf life of a given formulation.

        <p>At 25 °C, the mean droplet diameter was noticeably increased with time during storage except for CO-10. This indicates that the nanoemulsions were unstable to droplet growth at the highest storage temperature near the PIT. This can be ascribed to the fact that the rate of Ostwald ripening and/or droplet coalescence in a nanoemulsion rises in the temperature range just below the PIT (Chuesiang et al., 2018). This acceleration in coalescence might be attributed to the partial dehydration of Tween 80 head groups resulting in relatively low interfacial tension and the monolayers become highly flexible, which facilitates the fusion of oil droplets when they collide.At 25 °C, the mean droplet diameter was noticeably increased with time during storage except for CO-10.

        <p>In the case of CO-10, it showed a significant decrease in particle size over time at 25 °C from 23 to 13 nm. This suggests that higher concentrations of hydrophilic surfactant is effective in solubilizing a medium chain triglyceride such as coconut oil. The addition of lipophilic loratadine at approximately 50% of the oil phase (acts as ripening inhibitor) exerts an optimal compositional effect by reducing the oil's aqueous solubility, if added together prior to homogenization (Ryu et al., 2018) (Chuesiang et al., 2018), however, this behavior requires further studies.

        <p>However, we observed that all the nanoemulsions had loratadine crystals formed within 20 days after preparation. This can be due to nanoemulsion cooling which resulted in drug supersaturation in the oil and/or aqueous phases, which would favor nucleation and crystal growth as proposed by Li et al., (2012). Varying parameters such as surfactant concentration, oil type and preparation method could not completely prevent loratadine crystal formation beyond 20 days of storage, and the same was reported by Li et al., (2012).However, we observed that all the nanoemulsions had loratadine crystals formed within 20 days after preparation.

        <p>Nanoemulsions have excellent stability against creaming, sedimentation, flocculation and coalescence due to small droplet size compared to coarse emulsions. However, they can undergo degradation via two well-known distinctive irreversible demulsification processes: coalescence and Ostwald ripening. Coalescence occurs due to collision of droplets with each other (Wang et al., 2008). The change in droplet size with time can be described by the following equation if the instability mechanism is coalescence:Nanoemulsions have excellent stability against creaming, sedimentation, flocculation and coalescence due to small droplet size compared to coarse emulsions.

        <p>Ostwald ripening is found to be the main mechanism producing instability in nanoemulsions (Li and Chiang, 2012). Ostwald ripening occurs due to the difference in the radius between droplets, and the difference in chemical potential of the oil phase between different droplets. In the ripening process, larger droplets grow at the expense of smaller ones due to molecular diffusion through the continuous phase. The Ostwald ripening rate, ω can be obtained by LSW (Lifshitz-Slezov-Wagner) theory:Ostwald ripening is found to be the main mechanism producing instability in nanoemulsions (Li and Chiang, 2012).

        <p>Fig. 10a suggests that there is no linear relationship upon plotting 1/r 2 as a function of time and indicates that coalescence is not the basic mechanism for the nanoemulsion instability. On the other hand, there was a good linear relationship between r 3 and time as shown in Fig. 10b indicating that the main instability process was indeed the asymptotic regime of Ostwald ripening and Brownian-induced coalescence and they are valid for very diluted emulsions where drop interactions are negligible (Nazarzadeh et al., 2013). It is worth noting that the presence of multimodal distribution as shown in Fig. 6b suggests that flocculation as another mechanism of destabilization, was operative with Ostwald ripening in nanoemulsions (Nazarzadeh et al., 2013).Fig. 10a suggests that there is no linear relationship upon plotting 1/r 2 as a function of time and indicates that coalescence is not the basic mechanism for the nanoemulsion instability.

        <p>Stable nanoemulsions containing saturated concentration of loratadine obtained by ultrasoundassisted two-step phase inversion and cooling-stepwise dilution process, have to the best of our knowledge, been reported for the first time in the area of transdermal drug delivery. In addition, the use of a drug molecule, loratadine, to function as a ripening inhibitor is reported for the first time. The increase in preparation temperature and water volume fraction enhanced the surfactant adsorption at the o/w interface and reduced the viscous resistance of the oil phase. As a result, the droplet diameter did not exceed 50 nm after the preparation. During the emulsification method, the droplet diameter was primarily controlled by the microemulsion framework, and excess water only served as a dilution medium. Once nanoemulsions formed, the size distributions remained unchanged over the period of 6 months. The increased insolubility of the oil phase as a result of loratadine addition in the continuous phase prevented the Ostwald ripening process dramatically.Stable nanoemulsions containing saturated concentration of loratadine obtained by ultrasoundassisted two-step phase inversion and cooling-stepwise dilution process, have to the best of our knowledge, been reported for the first time in the area of transdermal drug delivery.
