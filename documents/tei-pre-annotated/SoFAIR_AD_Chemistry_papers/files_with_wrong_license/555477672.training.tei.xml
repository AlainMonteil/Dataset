        <p>Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO) were electro-generated and electro-deposited simultaneously on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) using cyclic voltammetry at a reduction potential of -1.4 V to -0.2 V in 0.1 M NaOH and 1.67 mM CuCl solution. The electrodeposited CuO nanoparticles show an excellent electro-catalytic activity towards the detection of potassium ferricyanide. The scan rate, concentration of the analyte and pH of the solution were varied accordingly to study the stability of the copper oxide deposited glassy carbon electrode (CuO/GCE). The CuO/GCE electrode shows amazing stability, charge transfer and reproducibility even at low concentration of the analyte. The cyclic voltammetry is proved to be one of the convenient methods to reduce the precursors into metal oxide nanoparticles just by applying suitable current. The main advantage of this method is uniform deposition of CuO nanoparticles on GCE and thus increases the number of active sites, surface area and electro-catalytic properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the morphology of the electro-generated CuO nanoparticles. The zeta-potential analysis was carried out to study the surface potential of charged CuO nanoparticles and it was found to be + 58.29 mV. Further, CuO nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction to study the phases. UV-visible spectroscopy depicts the absorption peak at 288 nm confirms the formation of CuO nanoparticles. This absorption is attributed by the electronic transition from valence band to conduction band due to the quantum size of the particles.Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO) were electro-generated and electro-deposited simultaneously on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) using cyclic voltammetry at a reduction potential of -1.4 V to -0.2 V in 0.1 M NaOH and 1.67 mM CuCl solution.

        <p>Nanotechnology has become a hot research area for many researchers working in chemistry, physics, materials science, biomaterials field etc. due to the excellent and unique properties of nanomaterials [1]. In recent past, the researchers showing a substantial interest in metal oxide nanoparticles due to their unusual, unique and remarkable properties due to very fine size [2][3][4][5]. It has been reported that as the particle size of the nanomaterials decreases; then most of their properties like catalytic properties [6,7], mechanical reinforcement [8], electrical conductivity [9], photo catalytic activity [10], hardness, strength of metals and alloys [11,12] and super paramagnetic properties of magnetic oxides [13] will change significantly. Due to quantum confinement; the nanoparticles show strange optical and electrical properties [14]. Dispersion of these nanoparticles in lesser quantity in various fluids allows traditional methods cyclic voltammetry proved to be one of the suitable method to deposit nanoparticles uniformly on the electrode which closely integrate with electrode [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37]. This increases the number of active sites, surface area and thus increases the catalytic property of the deposited nanoparticles.Nanotechnology has become a hot research area for many researchers working in chemistry, physics, materials science, biomaterials field etc. due to the excellent and unique properties of nanomaterials [1].

        <p>Potassium ferricyanide is a bright red colour octahedral coordination compound soluble in water and its solution shows green yellow fluorescence [38]. It is used in a dot etching process as an oxidizing agent to remove silver from negatives and positives; and in colour photograph to reduce the size of colour dots without reducing their numbers.

        <p>The electrode surface was carefully cleaned and polished with aluminium (0.05 mm diameter) powder on polishing From the figure it is confirm that, CuO/GCE show higher sensitivity than BGCE in analyzing potassium ferricyanide in the same experimental conditions. This confirms the deposition of CuO nanoparticles on glassy carbon electrode shows good sensitivity in detecting potassium ferricyanide. We also calculated the exposed surface area of the electrode using Randles-Sevcik equation and the value was found to be 2.9 mm. The potential cycles plays an important role in depositing uniform, optimum thickness of CuO nanoparticles on the electrode. Hence we deposited CuO nanoparticles on glassy carbon electrode at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 cycles to get better, uniform, optimum thickness of CuO nano film on electrode to increase the sensitivity of CuO/GCE. After each number of potential cycles, the current sensitivity of CuO/GCE is measured and after each measurement the electrode surface is cleaned carefully with distilled water and polished with aluminium (0.05 mm diameter) slurry on polishing cloth followed by sonicating in ethanol and doubly distilled water (1:1, v/v) for 5 min. Again deposited CuO nanoparticles on the electrode and studied the current sensitivity phenomenon by the same procedure but at different potential cycles. Figure 2a andb show cyclic voltammograms at different number of potential cycles and a graph of cathodic peak current versus number of cycles. We obtained the maximum cathodic peak current of 19.46 μA after 15 cycles and 19.14 μA after 20 cycles. Here, the cathodic peak current increases up to 15 cycles and then suddenly decreases at 20 cycles due to decrease in the active sites and surface area of deposited CuO nanoparticles at 20 cycles. Hence CuO/GCE shows greater stability and sensitivity after 15 potential cycles and therefore we used this electrode for further experimental studies.The electrode surface was carefully cleaned and polished with aluminium (0.05 mm diameter) powder on polishing From the figure it is confirm that, CuO/GCE show higher sensitivity than BGCE in analyzing potassium ferricyanide in the same experimental conditions.

        <p>B. N. Chandrashekar et al. reported the increase of redox peak current with increase in the concentration of most of the analytes [44]. Therefore we studied the effect of different concentration of potassium ferricyanide on the cathodic peak current of CuO/GCE by using cyclic voltammetry. Concentration of only potassium ferricyanide is increased from 1 to 3 mM by keeping the supporting electrolyte concentration constant (1 M KCl). Figure 3a shows cyclic voltammogram of 1 to 3 mM concentration of potassium ferricyanide in 1 M KCl solution at scan rate 100 mV/s. From the figure it is confirmed that, cathodic peak current increases with increase in the concentration of potassium ferricyanide. The graph of cathodic peak current against different concentrations of potassium ferricyanide shows a linear relationship as shown in the Fig. 3b. Cathodic peak current increases from 45.6 to 86.5 μA with increase in the concentration of potassium ferricyanide from 1 to 3 mM.B. N.

        <p>The pH of the supporting electrolyte is one of the main experimental parameters that can affect the voltammetric response of the potassium ferricyanide at CuO/GCE. Therefore, an optimum pH is required to maximize the intensity of redox peak currents. The electrochemical response of potassium ferricyanide at CuO/GCE is found to be pH dependent. Figure 4a shows the graph of cathodic peak current versus different pH of the acetate buffer solution (3.2 to 6.3) at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. From the graph it is clear that CuO/GCE show maximum anodic peak current at pH 5 due to the increased rate of reduction at this pH. The maximum cathodic peak current of CuO/GCE at pH 5 is found to be 47μA. Therefore, for the further analysis, pH 5 was selected. Figure 4b show a Plot of E˚ v/s pH curve and it show linear relation of reduction potential and pH of the solution.The pH of the supporting electrolyte is one of the main experimental parameters that can affect the voltammetric response of the potassium ferricyanide at CuO/GCE.

        <p>The absorption peak is probably related to the electronic from valence band to conduction band due to the quantum size of the particle [49]. Peak at 288 nm is attributed by the formation of CuO nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 6. This band suggests the higher structural organization in the particle that takes place due to the donor-acceptor nature of metal ion, which leads to size-quantization effect due to band transition [50]. The broad absorbance peak is due to the nano structure of prepared CuO nanoparticles.The absorption peak is probably related to the electronic from valence band to conduction band due to the quantum size of the particle [49].

The zeta-potential of CuO nanoparticles are studied by dispersing them in double distilled water. The zeta-potential of particles is a good indicator of their electrical potentials. Higher the zeta potential, the greater will be the surface potential of charged Particles [2]. The zeta potential of prepared CuO nanoparticles is found to be + 58.29 mV. Detailed output of the zeta-potential and the particle size distribution is shown Fig. 9.

        <p>We prepared CuO nanoparticles by electro-deposition and electro-generation at the same time using glassy carbon electrode by cyclic voltammetry method. The fabricated CuO/GCE proved to be a highly sensitive and stable electrode in determining the potassium ferricyanide. We also studied the effect of potential cycles, scan rate, concentration of analyte and pH on the cathodic peak current of ferricyanide. In the later part of the experiment we also electro-generated CuO nanoparticles for further characterization. The prepared CuO nanoparticles exhibit excellent electro-catalytic properties due their high surface area and availability of large number of reaction sites in CuO/GCE. In future, the fabricated electrode can be a potential candidate in detecting environmentally toxic potassium ferricyanide in bleaching powder. We strongly believe that the fabricated modified CuO/GCE can also be the potential electrode for the determination of various bioactive organic molecules.
