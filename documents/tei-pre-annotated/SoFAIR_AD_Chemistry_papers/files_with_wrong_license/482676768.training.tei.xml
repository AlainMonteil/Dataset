        <p>This communication reports experimental and theoretical evidences of s-hole interactions in adducts between nitrogen or oxygen nucleophiles and tetroxides of osmium or other group 8 elements. Cocrystals between pyridine or pyridine N-oxide derivatives and osmium tetroxide are characterized through various techniques and rationalized as s-hole interactions using DFT calculations and several other computational tools. We propose the term "osme bond" (OmB, Om = Fe, Ru, Os, (Hs)) for naming the noncovalent interactions wherein group 8 elements have the role of the electrophile. The word osme is the transcription of sm , the ancient Greek word for smell that was used to name the heaviest group 8 element in relation to the smoky odor of its tetroxide.This communication reports experimental and theoretical evidences of s-hole interactions in adducts between nitrogen or oxygen nucleophiles and tetroxides of osmium or other group 8 elements.

        <p>The surface electrostatic potential of molecules is typically not uniform. Regions where it is positive can be present and they tend to act as the electrophilic sites in attractive interactions with regions in surrounding molecules where it is negative. A systematic rationalization of intermolecular interactions based on this mindset began in the 1990s when a region of most positive electrostatic potential, [1] the so called s-hole, [2] was found on the surface of halogen atoms in dihalogens and halocarbons and when soon after the resulting electrophilic character of halogens began to be exploited in supramolecular chemistry. [3] Analogous s-holes with positive electrostatic potential were successively identified on other elements of p-block of the periodic table, for example, on elements of groups 14, [4] 15, [5] and 16. [6] The attractive interactions occurring between these positive holes and nucleophilic sites are now topics of intense research in fields as diverse as drug design, [7] catalysis, [8] and anion transport. [9] While in some adducts involving d-block elements a clearcut identification of the electropositive (i.e., electrophilic) and electronegative (i.e., nucleophilic) components is hardly possible, this identification is fairly straightforward for some other adducts wherein s-holes have been identified on metals. The understanding of resulting adducts as s-hole systems helps in recognizing the electronic basis of observed geometries. [10] For instance, the localization of positive s-holes on the group 11 metals in respective halides [11] allows for a rationalization of the geometry of the adducts formed with anions and lone-pair possessing atoms. [11][12][13] An analogous rationalization based on s-holes has been suggested for the geometries of some adducts given by group 12 elements [14] and is proposed here for the geometries of cocrystals involving derivatives of group 8.The surface electrostatic potential of molecules is typically not uniform.

        <p>Specifically, we report that cocrystals have been obtained between osmium tetroxide and pyridine and pyridine N-oxide derivatives (Figure 1). In these adducts short Os•••O/N contacts [16] are present on the extension of one of O-Os covalent bonds of OsO 4 , consistent with the rationalization of these interactions as s-hole bondings. Calculation of the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surface of iron, ruthenium, and osmium tetroxides shows the presence of positive s-holes (Figure 2) at the regions of approach of the nucleophile.

        <p>s-Hole interactions are typically categorized referring to the group of the periodic table to which the atom at the electrophilic site belongs. [17,18] We propose that the term osme bond (OmB, Om = Fe, Ru, Os, (Hs)) is used for interactions described in this paper and for analogous interactions wherein group 8 elements are the electrophile (section S1.1). Osme is the transliteration of sm , the old Greek word for smell which was used by S. Tennant in 1803 to name osmium in relation to the smoky odor of OsO 4 .

        <p>IR spectra of solid adducts 2 show the presence of absorptions of both 1 and OsO 4 . Changes of bands frequencies and intensities in 2 with respect to pure 1 and OsO 4 indicate the presence of well-defined chemical species rather than a mechanical mixture (Figures S1-S5). The nC-H bands of pyridine rings (2850-3100 cm À1 for pure 1) are blue-shifted and become weaker on adducts 2 formation. These changes are similar to those observed when 1 give halogen bonded adducts [26] and suggest a decreased electron density at CÀH groups on adducts 2 assembly, consistent with an n!s* donation from N/O atoms to Os (see onwards). Also the pyridine breathing vibrations (1400-1600 cm À1 region) are blue-shifted in adducts 2, in analogy to other adducts wherein 1 are the nucleophiles. [27] The n3 vibration for pure OsO 4 is at 960 cm À1 in the gas phase and at 954 cm À1 in CCl 4 solution. [28] It is at 930 cm À1 for the hexamethylenetetramine•(OsO 4 ) 2 adduct in the solid and at 955 cm À1 in CCl 4 solution. [29] Cocrystals 2 a-f show this vibration at 900-910 cm À1 in the solid (consistent with non-minor vibrational changes of OsO 4 on adducts formation) and at higher frequencies (e.g., at 942 cm À1 for 2 a) in CHCl 3 solution, consistent with a partial dissociation of the adduct on dissolution. [30] Indeed, spectrophotometric studies showed that in solution the equilibrium between isolated OsO 4 and pyridine derivatives and the corresponding adducts is rapid even at low temperature [22] and equilibrium constants are extremely sensitive to steric effects. [31] The changes observed for the IR bands of pure components on adducts 2 formation agree well with DFT calculations, as discussed in the SI (S5.2, Figure S22). 13 C and 15 N solid state NMR (SSNMR) spectra of precursors 1 and cocrystals 2 are quite different and confirm the adducts formation. 15 ). [32] The 15 N SSNMR signal of 1 c is at 282.0 and 280.9 ppm in 1 c•(OsO 4 ) 2 , 269.1 ppm in 1 c•SbF 3, [33] 282. adducts, their normalized contacts (Nc) [15] are as small as 0.65-0.67 (Figure 1). It is thus reasonable to assume that the self-assembly of cocrystals 2 a-c is largely driven by these OmBs. The structures reported in Scheme 1 can be assigned to adducts 2 d, 2 e, and 2 f considering 13 C/ 15 N SSNMR spectra (Figures S16,S17) and 1 H NMR spectra in solution where analyses in the presence of an internal standard established that the OsO 4 to 1 d,e,f ratio in these adducts is 2:1, 1:1, and 1:1, respectively. As typical for short s-hole interactions, [2-6, 17, 18] S25). [23][24][25] The tetrahedral geometry of pure OsO 4 is slightly distorted on OmB formation. While the geometry around osmium remains essentially tetrahedral (e.g., O-Os-O angles in 2 a span the range 101.5-117.78), it becomes somewhat similar to a trigonal bipyramid, the incoming N or O atom occupying an apical position. A similar deformation from tetrahedral towards trigonal bipyramidal geometry is observed on formation of shole interactions involving tetravalent elements of group 14. [4,34] An elongation of the covalent bond opposite to the incoming nucleophile is common for s-hole interactions, [3,4] and is usually rationalized as a consequence of the LP!s* charge transfer. Such elongation is observed also in 2 a-c, e.g., in 2 b the OsÀO bond opposite to the Os•••N OmB is 171.2 pm while the mean value of the three other Os À O bonds is 169.2 pm and the mean Os À O bond in pure OsO 4 is 169.7 pm. [35] Computation affords analogous elongations (see onwards).IR spectra of solid adducts 2 show the presence of absorptions of both 1 and OsO 4 .

        <p>To investigate the existence and intensity of s-holes in OsO 4 and analogous derivatives of other group 8 elements, the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces of the OmO 4 species have been computed. Similar to OsO 4 , RuO 4 forms adducts with derivatives containing lone pair donor atoms [36] while FeO 4 is an unknown compounds but it has been included for comparison purposes. Figure 2 shows the MEP surfaces of the three tetroxides studied herein; the same energetic scale and two different orientations are presented. Four symmetrically equivalent s-holes are observed opposite to the O-Om bonds. The depth of the s-holes increases on going from Fe to Os, being significantly more intense for Ru and Os (+ 31.4 and + 36.4 kcal mol À1 , respectively) than for Fe (+ 18.0 kcal mol À1 ). The MEP minimum values in the three compounds are quite small, thus revealing the overall electrophilic nature of these molecules.To investigate the existence and intensity of s-holes in OsO 4 and analogous derivatives of other group 8 elements, the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces of the OmO 4 species have been computed.

        <p>In order to analyze the ability of OmO 4 compounds to establish OmBs, six adducts have been fully optimized at the PBE0-D3/def2-TZVP level of theory. Acetonitrile and pyridine, two typical Lewis bases were used. The intermolecular interactions revealed by the combined QTAIM/NCIplot analysis are represented in Table 1 andFigure Table 1: Interaction energies (DE, kcal mol À1 ), equilibrium distances (pm) between N and Om atoms, and electron charge densities (1 r , a.u.) at the bond CPs connecting N and Om atoms for the adducts between OmO 4 (Om = Fe, Ru, Os) and acetonitrile or pyridine. The stabilization energies from the second order perturbation analysis E (2) (kcal mol À1 ) corresponding to the LP(N) ! s*(Om-O) orbital donor-acceptor interactions are also indicated. is yellow disclosing some N•••O repulsion between the negative O atoms and the N atom of the Lewis base. The theoretical distance computed in the gas phase (251 pm) is in reasonable agreement with the experimental distances observed in cocrystals 2 a,b ( % 240 pm). Table 1 also summarizes the results from the natural bond orbital analysis applied to the adducts shown in Figure 3. In all cases we have found from modest to moderate orbital donor-acceptor contributions, ranging from 0.24 to 5.63 kcal mol À1 , as a consequence of the electron donation from the nitrogens lone pair to the antibonding s* orbitals (Om-O). The orbital contribution is very sensitive to the equilibrium distance. Consequently, for the weakest adduct O 4 Fe•••NCCH 3 with the longest equilibrium distance the contribution is around 10 % of the interaction energy. In sharp contrast, for the strongest adduct (O 4 Os•••NC 5 H 5 ) the orbital contribution is approximately 50 % of the interaction energy. A similar behavior is obtained when computing the total orbital contribution using the EDA partition Scheme (sections S5.1, S5.3, Table S26, Figure S23). For all adducts, the distance of the O-Om bond opposite to the electron donor atoms increases upon complexation, in line with the effect of filling the s*(Om-O) orbital.In order to analyze the ability of OmO 4 compounds to establish OmBs, six adducts have been fully optimized at the PBE0-D3/def2-TZVP level of theory.

        <p>It is interesting to highlight that we have found a strong relationship (r = 0.994) between the interaction energies and the values of the charge density the bond CPs, as shown in Figure 4, thus suggesting that the value of 1 can be used as an energy predictor for OmBs. Similar relationships have been observed for other s-hole interactions like halogen, [37] chalcogen [38] and pnictogen bonds. [39] Similar QTAIM/NCIplot analyses (Figure 5) have been performed for the adducts characterized by X-ray in order to prove that the experimentally observed short contacts are not crystal packing effects. In all systems Finally, the interaction energies of the contacts have been estimated using the equation shown in Figure 4, their values are very similar in all adducts (À14.5 to À14.9 kcal mol À1 ) (see also Table S27). These values agree well with the crystallographic short Os•••N/O distances and the dark blue color of the NCIplot isosurfaces.It is interesting to highlight that we have found a strong relationship (r = 0.994) between the interaction energies and the values of the charge density the bond CPs, as shown in Figure 4, thus suggesting that the value of 1 can be used as an energy predictor for OmBs.

        <p>The MEPs of osmium imido derivatives OsO 4Àn (= NR) n were calculated (n = 1-4, R = Me, t-Bu, 1-adamantyl) to assess how the electrostatic potential at the Os s-holes depend on the groups covalently bonded to Os (section S5.5, Figures S24-S26, Table S28). The s-holes opposite to nitrogen are less positive than opposite to oxygen and can become negative in polyimido derivatives (OsO 4Àn (= NR) n , n = 2-4). Importantly, NCIplot analysis shows that OmB presence is not limited to OsO 4 adducts.The MEPs of osmium imido derivatives OsO 4Àn (= NR) n were calculated (n = 1-4, R = Me, t-Bu, 1-adamantyl) to assess how the electrostatic potential at the Os s-holes depend on the groups covalently bonded to Os (section S5.5, Figures S24-S26, Table S28).

        <p>The crystallographic and computational results reported here consistently identify the net attractive interaction between tetroxides and imido-oxides of group 8 elements and lone pair possessing atoms as a case of the wider set of the so named s-hole interactions. The name osme bond is proposed to categorize these noncovalent interactions in contrast to the metal-ligand bond of classical coordination complexes. In competitive processes of cocrystal formation, the osme bond can prevail over the hydrogen bond in determining the composition of preferentially formed cocrystals. The tendency of OsO 4 to form adducts with lone pair donors (e.g., amine and pyridine derivatives) has been studied in relation to the asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins by OsO 4 . The results reported here may offer new insights on the correlation between the catalytic effect and the binding of OsO 4 to the nitrogen donor.
