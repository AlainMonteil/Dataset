        <p>Detecting metal ions in vivo with a high spatiotemporal resolution is critical to understanding the roles of the metal ions in both healthy and disease states. Although spatiotemporal controls of metal-ion sensors using light have been demonstrated, the lack of penetration depth in tissue and in vivo has limited their application. To overcome this limitation, we herein report the use of highintensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to remotely deliver on-demand, spatiotemporally resolved thermal energy to activate the DNAzyme sensors at the targeted region both in vitro and in vivo. A Zn 2+selective DNAzyme probe is inactivated by a protector strand to block the formation of catalytic enzyme structure, which can then be activated by an HIFU-induced increase in the local temperature. With this design, Zn 2+ -specific fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging has been demonstrated by the new DNAzyme-HIFU probes in both HeLa cells and mice. The current method can be applied to monitor many other metal ions for in vivo imaging and medical diagnosis using metal-specific DNAzymes that have either been obtained or can be selected using in vitro selection.</p>
        <p>Metal ions are essential for many biological processes because of their many roles, including stabilizing biomolecules, regulating molecular interactions, and catalyzing chemical and biological reactions. Abnormally low or high levels of metal ions can lead to diseases, such as anemia and growth retardation. 1,2 Therefore, site-specific monitoring of the distribution and concentration fluctuation of metal ions in situ can provide critical information for human health and diseases. To achieve this goal, instrumental analyses, such as atomic absorption/emission spectroscopy, 3 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, 4,5 and X-ray fluorescence microtomography, 6 are used to detect and measure metal ions. However, these techniques do not permit real-time monitoring of metal ions in living cells and tissues. To overcome this limitation, sensors based on small molecules, [7][8][9] peptides, 10 and proteins [11][12][13] are extensively explored for metal ion detection. Despite progress made by many investigators, sensors are still limited to a small number of metal ions. More importantly, since metal ions are distributed in different locations of biological systems with time-dependent fluctuation, it is important to develop sensors with high spatiotemporal resolution. Toward this objective, optical control of metal-ion sensors has been reported. 14 However, it is difficult to employ light to monitor metal ions in animal and human bodies for such control because of the low tissue penetration depth.</p>
        <p>DNAzymes, which are DNA molecules with enzymatic activities, have emerged as an important class of sensors for metal ions. [15][16][17] Compared with other metal-ion probes, [7][8][9] DNAzymes with high metal ion selectivity can be obtained through in vitro selection from a large DNA library of up to 10 15 sequences and can be converted to fluorescence, colorimetric, 18 and other types of sensors 19 by conjugating with a variety of reporters. 20 During the past decades, DNAzyme-based sensors have been reported for the detection of many metal ions (e.g., Na + , Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Cu + /Cu 2+ , Pb 2+ , UO2 2+ , Hg 2+ , Tl + , and Cd 2+ ), and the metal-ion-specific DNAzyme toolbox is still expanding. 21,22 In addition, DNAzymes have the merits of easy synthesis, and high programmability and sensitivity for targeted metal ions in vitro. [23][24][25][26] Benefitting from the biocompatibility of DNA, DNAzymes have also been used in metal ion detection in living cells and zebrafish. The first intracellular application of DNAzymes as a metal-ion sensor was reported for the detection of uranyl, but the application lacked spatiotemporal control. 12 Later reports introduce spatiotemporal control in either living cells or zebrafish using a photocaging group at the putative cleavage site and the detection can be controlled by removing the caging group using UV light (365 nm) directly, 27,28 or by upconverting near-infrared (IR) light to UV light by conjugating the DNAzyme to lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). 29 Taking advantage of the light-responsive nanomaterials, such as the nanoshell, 30 that can increase the local temperature, spatiotemporal control of the DNAzyme-based metal ion detection was achieved without using a caging group. Although the spatiotemporal control of DNAzyme-based metal ion detection using an external light source has been achieved in living cells and zebrafish, it would be difficult to apply the method in animals and human bodies because of the penetration depth limitation (&lt;12 mm). 31 To address the above issues of the spatiotemporal control of DNAzyme-based metal ion detection, we herein report a remote and noninvasive control to modulate the activation of a DNAzyme-based metal-ion probe with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Ultrasound is a minimally invasive modality that is capable of penetrating deep into intervening tissues and overcoming the weakness of light-based control. [32][33][34][35][36] Acoustic energy from the ultrasound system can be focused onto a focal spot determined by the excitation frequency, making it possible to activate the DNAzyme in a specific target area. Because of these advantages, HIFU has found success in applications including tumor ablation, 35,37 neurosurgery, 33,38,39 pain management, 40 and drug delivery. 41 Importantly, by focusing an ultrasonic wave onto the target location, the high intensity of irradiation can also cause localized heating from energy dissipation and can be further used to control the gene expression of bacteria 42 or the release Journal of the American Chemical Society of drugs. 34,43 Since lower thermal dose at mild temperature has less effect on the survivability of cells and tissues, 44,45 we integrate the heat control of HIFU with DNAzyme for metal ion detection in vivo.</p>
        <p>The design of a HIFU-activated DNAzyme sensor is shown in Figure 1. We choose Zn 2+ -specific 8-17 DNAzyme 46 as the proof of concept for method development because it is the most well studied and broadly used DNAzyme for cellular and in vivo applications. 29,30 In addition, Zn 2+ plays important roles in biological systems, including protein function regulations. 47,48 Dysregulation of Zn 2+ has also been linked to prostate cancer. 49 In our design, DNAzyme is inactivated by hybridization between the protector strand (P) with the enzyme strand (E) so that DNAzyme is inactive until the introduction of HIFU. Upon HIFU treatment, the heat is generated to increase the local temperature from 37 to 43 °C, which can induce the dehybridization of P-E strands (Figures S1 andS2). 43 We choose to increase the local temperature to 43 °C because it is the upper temperature limit of mild hyperthermia in mice and has been used in drug delivery. 50 As a result, the E strand can then hybridize to the substrate strand (S) to form the active DNAzyme conformation. At the same time, a helper strand (H) is also added into the system to eliminate the free P strand after HIFU stimulation. In the presence of target Zn 2+ , the S strand is cleaved by the E strand. Because of the low melting temperature of the cleaved product (27 °C), it is released from the E strand at the physiological temperature to generate detectable signals.</p>
        <p>At present, most DNAzyme-based sensors are designed with a one-step "off-on" signal change for metal ion detection. They have difficulty in distinguishing the false-positive signal from background activation or knowing the detailed procedures of HIFU-triggered multiple-step DNAzyme-catalyzed reactions. To monitor the step-by-step reactions and produce optical signals from the HIFU-activated DNAzyme sensor, we conjugated Cy3 to the 3′ of the E strand, IABkFQ to the 5′ of P strand, and Cy5 to the 5′ of the S strand (Figure 1). Since the IABkFQ quencher was close to Cy3 upon hybridization between the E and P strands, the initial threestranded construct would display minimal fluorescence signal from Cy3. This prediction from the design was indeed observed when the three DNA strands were hybridized using a protocol described in the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 2a, upon excitation at 514 nm, the three-strand DNA probe and H construct displayed minimal signal at 565 nm where Cy3 is expected to be fluorescent; only a weak signal at 666 nm was observed, which could be attributed to fluorescence from Cy5. Once P was released from the complex structure upon HIFU heating, the quencher IABkFQ moved away from Cy3, while Cy5 on the substrate strand moved close to Cy3 due to the formation of active DNAzyme configuration. As a result, a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal between Cy3 and Cy5 was expected. To simulate such a case of an increase in temperature due to HIFU, we incubated the above DNAzyme probe at 43 °C and observed increased fluorescence signals at both 565 and 666 nm (Figure 2b), indicating that the FRET between Cy3 and Cy5 indeed occurred. Upon addition of Zn 2+ , the Cy3 fluorescence signal at 565 nm increased, while the Cy5 fluorescence signal at 666 nm decreased. This result was consistent with the design shown in Figure 1 that, upon Zn 2+ -dependent cleavage of the S strand, the cleaved product containing Cy5 was released from Cy3, causing the FRET between Cy3 and Cy5 to disappear and thus resulting in an increased fluorescent signal of Cy3 and a decreased fluorescent signal of Cy5. Importantly, without the two-dye design, it is difficult to know if the resulting signal is triggered by HIFU and then Zn 2+ in a stepwise manner.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether the helper strand (H) was necessary for the design shown in Figure 1, we removed H from the above mixture and found that, although the P strand involved three-strand probe was stable before the thermal treatment; a lower fluorescent signal was observed after the activation than that of the three-strand construct (see Figures S3 andS4). Therefore, P and H strands play important roles in ensuring the performance of our sensors. First, P prevents the hybridization between the S and E chains and stabilizes the probe before the HIFU treatment. In addition, since P and H have sequences complementary to each other; they form a double-stranded complex after the thermal treatment to avoid any potential inhibition effect from the protectors to the S or E strand (Figure S5).</p>
        <p>After validating the design of the DNAzyme-HIFU probe, its performance was evaluated with the kinetic study. As shown in Figure 3a, at 37 °C, no obvious Cy5 fluorescence change at 666 nm was observed, even after the addition of 20 μM of Zn 2+ at the 30 min time point (Figure 3a), demonstrating that the E strand is well protected by the P strand, preventing it from cleaving. Interestingly, the Cy3 fluorescence intensity at 565 nm increased slightly after the addition of Zn 2+ . This result suggests that Zn 2+ may promote the formation of the active DNAzyme configuration 30 (see the red region of the E strand in Figure 1) and weaken the hybridization between P and E strands. On the other hand, if the DNAzyme-HIFU probe is incubated at 43 °C for 30 min, the fluorescence intensity at 565 nm keeps constant, while that at 666 nm gradually increases up to 3.3-fold compared to that when it is incubated at 37 °C for the same time (Figure 3b). These results indicate that the protector P is released under higher temperature and active DNAzyme is formed in 30 min. Then, we removed the heat treatment and added 20 μM zinc ions. The fluorescence intensity at 565 nm increased and the signals at 666 nm decreased, consistent with the cleavage of the S strand and Cy5 moving away from Cy3.</p>
        <p>Given that the Cy5/Cy3 FRET signal of the DNAzyme-HIFU probe is correlated to Zn 2+ -dependent DNAzyme activity (Figures 2c and3b), we investigate the quantitative relationship between the FRET signal and Zn 2+ concentrations. As shown in Figure 3c-e, the FRET ratio (F A /F D ) shows a linear relationship with Zn 2+ concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 μM. Based on the linear fit of this relationship, a limit of detection (LOD) of 345 nM Zn 2+ was obtained, based on the common LOD definition of 3 times the standard deviation of the blank samples' FRET ratios divided by the slope (3σ/ slope).</p>
        <p>After establishing that the DNAzyme-HIFU probe works when heated at 43 °C, we evaluated its performance using the proposed HIFU setup to temporally control and elevate the temperature for 30 min (Figure S6). As shown in Figure 3f, without Zn 2+ and HIFU, a minimal fluorescence signal at 565 nm was observed, indicating that the Cy3 fluorescence was mostly quenched by the IABkFQ quencher. After HIFU sonication 30 min, but in the absence of Zn 2+ , fluorescence signals at 565 and 666 nm increased (Figure 3f), indicating the formation of the active DNAzyme, consistent with the thermal treatment experiments (cf. Figures 2b and3b). Finally, after the HIFU treatment, and upon the addition of 20 μM Zn 2+ , the Cy3 fluorescence at 565 nm increased and Cy5 signal at 666 nm decreased, which was consistent with the thermal treatment experiments (cf. Figures 2c and3b), suggesting that the S strand was cleaved and Cy5-conjugated cleaved strand moved away from the Cy3-conjugated E strand.</p>
        <p>Having demonstrated the DNAzyme-HIFU probe in test tubes, we evaluated its performance in cells. First, we tested the stability and feasibility of the probe in cell lysates. As shown in Figure S7, after incubation of the probe in cell lysate at 37 °C for 2 h, a weak increase in the fluorescent signals at 565 and 666 nm was observed. This increase would be expected because of the robust nuclease activity found in HeLa cell lysates. We observed that the fluorescence at 565 nm increased by 2.46-folds upon heat treatment and Zn 2+ addition (Figure S7) compared with without the heat treatment, suggesting that the probe was suitable for application in living cells.</p>
        <p>To test the performance of the probe for sensing Zn 2+ in HeLa cells, the probe with the TurboFect transfection reagent was first incubated with the cells for 3 h to allow sufficient uptake. To find out if the HIFU treatment to increase the local temperature to 43 °C would cause any damage to the cells, we checked the cell morphology before and after HIFU treatment for 30 min and found minimal changes (Figure S8). To quantify the effect, we carried out the MTT assay of HeLa cells after incubating the cells at 43 °C in a water bath for 1 and 2 h, and the cell viability remained 98.96 and 101.36%, respectively (Figure S9). In addition, the HIFU treatment of the cells at 43 °C for 30 min caused minimal effects on the viability of HeLa cells (Figure S9). Our results are consistent with previous studies that showed minimal effects of HIFU treatment on cell viability. 51 Therefore, a 30 min HIFU treatment of the cells was performed in the following cells studies. The HeLa cells were incubated with 40 μM Zn 2+ for 30 min and confocal imaging was collected. To find out if 40 μM Zn 2+ could be toxic to the cells, we performed the MTT assay on HeLa cells treated with 40 μM ZnCl 2 and 40 μM zinc ionophore pyrithione (PT). As shown in Figure S10, the cells remained viable up to 1 h under this condition. Afterward, the stability of different probe compositions was tested in HeLa cells. As shown in Figure S11, negligible Cy3 fluorescence was observed in the ESPH system, indicating good stability of the probe in living cells. As shown in Figures 4a andS12, without the addition of Zn 2+ , minimal fluorescent signals were observed in the HeLa cells before the HIFU treatment (Figure 4a). After the HIFU sonication, the Cy3 signal increased (Figure 4a,b); the FRET ratio between Cy5/Cy3 was enhanced (Figure 4c). The enhanced FRET ratio demonstrated the formation of active DNAzyme inside the cells, which was consistent with the in vitro studies (Figure 3f). The newly formed DNAzyme could react with endogenous mobile Zn 2+ and produce the Cy3 signal. These results indicated that the DNAzyme system could be used to monitor cellular Zn 2+ ions under HIFU control. To further corroborate this finding, we added 40 μM Zn 2+ into the cells after the HIFU sonication and observed an even further increase in the Cy3 fluorescent intensity (Figure 4d,e). The HeLa cells with the HIFU treatment showed 2.32 times higher Cy3 signal than the cells without the HIFU treatment. Finally, to demonstrate the noninvasive and spatiotemporal control of our DNAzyme-HIFU probe to detect metal ions in vivo (Figure S13), we performed a subcutaneous test in BALB/ c mice (Figures 5a, S14, andS15). Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and maintained on a surgical stage of anesthesia throughout the procedure (Supporting Information, Figures S16-S18). Thirty microliters of the reaction buffer (12.5 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 3.3 μM of the probe and 40 μM of Zn 2+ was subcutaneously injected bilaterally near the fourth mammary fat pads (Supporting Information, Figure S18b). As shown in Figure 5b, the mice demonstrated intrinsically weak background signals after the initial injection, which was attributed to the quenching effect from IAbRQ. We then applied HIFU heating to the left side of the mice while leaving the right side without HIFU as a negative control. The signal on the control right flank increased over time, probably due to the enzyme-triggered DNA digestion or global temperature increase by HIFU. After 25 min of HIFU sonication (Figure S18d), the fluorescence signal on the heated left flank showed less difference compared to the right flank without the HIFU treatment (Figure 5c,e). It was possible that the thermal conduction and DNAzyme reaction were slower inside the mice compared to in vitro and cellular experiments. Thirty minutes after sonication, the left flanks of the mice showed 1.91 times higher signal compared with the untreated right flanks (Figure 5d,e), indicating the disassembly of the DNAzyme via activation through HIFU sonication. Furthermore, after 60 min, a 2.42-fold increase in fluorescence was observed on the HIFU-treated flanks (Supporting Information, Figure S14). To further validate that the sensor can be used to detect the endogenous metal ions in mice, a blank control was performed with probe only and without additional metal ions (Supporting Information, Figure S15). Under the same conditions, the flank sonicated by the spatiotemporally released acoustic energy from HIFU showed an enhanced fluorescent signal, demonstrating the robustness of our sensor in monitoring the microenvironment metal ions in vivo.</p>
        <p>We have demonstrated remote spatiotemporal control of DNAzyme probes to detect and image Zn 2+ in both HeLa cells and mice using HIFU. This objective was achieved by careful designing a three-stranded DNA probe and a helper strand consisting of not only E and S strands of the DNAzymes but also a protector strand to the above E and S strands so that, upon HIFU sonication, the protector strands would dehybridize from the E and S strands to allow the formation of active DNAzyme configuration and thus the Zn 2+ -dependent cleavage of the S strand. The design was verified by conjugating fluorophores and quencher to the ends of S, E, and one of the protector strands and monitoring each step to show that the probe displays minimal activity before HIFU activation and much higher activity after HIFU sonication. This demonstration of the noninvasive and high spatiotemporal control of DNAzyme-based probes has broadened the applications of DNAzymes for metal ion detection, making it a powerful tool for imaging metal ions in vivo, including monitoring metal ions in metabolic processes and providing pivotal information for metal ions involved in medicine.</p>
