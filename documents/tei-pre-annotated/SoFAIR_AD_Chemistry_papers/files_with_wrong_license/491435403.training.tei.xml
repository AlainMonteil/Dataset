        <p>Due to distinct characteristics of the adsorption technique, this technique can be utilized to adsorb furfural efficiently. As an environmentally friendly technique, the pomegranate peel was used to synthesized activated carbon and nanostructure of zerovalent iron impregnated on the synthesized activated carbon. The physicochemical and crystallinity characterization was done using Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The nanoparticles are porous in structure having 821.74 m 2 /g specified surface area. The maximum amount of the adsorbent pores in the range of 3.08 nm shows the microporous structure and enhancement in adsorption capacity. The effects of increment in concentration of adsorbent, pH, reaction contact time and adsorbent dose, isothermal and kinetic behaviour were investigated. At the UV wavelength of 227 nm furfural adsorption was detected. The separation of the furfural from the aqueous solution was calculated at the 1 h reaction time at the composite dosage of 4 g/L, 250 mg/L adsorbent concentration and pH kept at 7. The 81.87% is the maximum removal attained by the nanocomposite in comparison to the activated carbon is 62.06%. Furfural adsorption was also analyzed by using the equations of isothermal and kinetics models. The adsorption process analysis depends on the Freundlich isotherm and Intra-particle diffusion than the other models. The maximum adsorbent of the composite was determined by the Langmuir model which is 222.22 mg/g. The furfural removal enhances as the adsorbent dose enhances. The developed zerovalent iron nanoparticles incorporated on activated carbon (AC/nZVI) from pomegranate peel extract are feasible as an efficient and inexpensive adsorbent to eliminate furfural from a liquid solution.Due to distinct characteristics of the adsorption technique, this technique can be utilized to adsorb furfural efficiently.

        <p>The water sources are polluted by the presence of toxic materials, and substances. Complex chemical compounds of various industries such as petrochemicals, oil refineries, process units, and chemical production are the main contaminants and these industries have always been considered as a major source of environmental pollutants, especially for soil and water resources (Chen, Liang et al. 2019). Arsenic, hexavalent chromium (VI), lead and mercury are complex heavy metals among the wide range of elements and should be removed from the wastewater. 2-Furaldehyde (Furfural; C5H4O2) is used on a large scale in oil refineries, petrochemical industries, paper, and cardboard and is present in their wastewater of about 100-1200 mg/L limited (Zhang, Jiang et al. 2021). Furfural is the family of the aldehydes and furans, in which furan bond with hydrogen at 2substituted positions. Furfural is a bi-furfural liquid and oil that has an almond odour, rapidly turns to yellow furfural upon contact with air and water-soluble (Tarazanov, Grigoreva et al. 2020).The water sources are polluted by the presence of toxic materials, and substances.

        <p>Human exposure can occur through inhalation, swallowing, skin or eye contact, or absorption through the skin. Furfural (concentrations of 1.9-14 ppm) has caused headaches, redness of the eyes, and tearing in some workers exposed to it. Exposure to higher concentrations causes pulmonary edema in lungs (JAFARIAN, MALMASI et al. 2011). Several methods such as catalytic and photocatalytic methods, extraction from nano filtration solvents, cyclic biological reactor (CBR), biological degradation methods, and adsorption process. have been studied for furfural removal (Mao, Zhang et al. 2012). Studies have shown that furfural biodegradation includes both aerobic and anaerobic approaches, which are expensive (Sun, Liao et al. 2020).Human exposure can occur through inhalation, swallowing, skin or eye contact, or absorption through the skin.

        <p>Nanotechnology in adsorption has become promising for the separation of furfural. Several kinds of adsorbents such as nanoparticles, magnetic adsorbents, cheap adsorbents, bio-adsorbents, and carbon nanotubes have been fabricated and tested for furfural elimination (Alaei Shahmirzadi, Hosseini et al. 2018). Nanotechnology is the study of materials that are &lt;100 nm in size, and their physical, chemical and biological properties are fundamentally different from their origin. Polyol method, micro emulsions, thermal decomposition, electrochemical synthesis, sonochemical reduction and gamma radiation and many other are the proposed methods for the synthesis of nanoparticles (Ganguly, Das et al. 2017). Many of these methods are not efficient enough due to particle size, shape, and stabilization (Crucho and Barros 2017). To restraint the growth, shape of nanoparticles and keep them away from accumulating an efficient stabilizing agent and chemical reducing agents such as sodium borohydride and polyvinylpyrrolidone is used (Fazlzadeh, Khosravi et al. 2017).Nanotechnology in adsorption has become promising for the separation of furfural.

        <p>However, there is considerable interest in the biogenesis of metal nanoparticles using plant and microbial extracts. Plant extract synthesis or the green synthesis of nanoparticles have been prioritized because of the stability, low cost, energy efficient and non-toxic environment imparted by the nanoparticles (Gottimukkala, Harika et al. 2017). During the green synthesis, a redox reaction occurs in the saline solutions in which the plant extracts (reducing agents) transfer electrons to metal ions, and eventually, metal nanoparticles are produced. In this method, no pressure, energy, high temperature, and toxic chemicals are involved. Therefore, pose lower risks to humans and ecosystems and are cost-effective (Fazlzadeh, Khosravi et al. 2017). Today, zerovalent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) produced by natural materials (plant extracts) such as grape residue, grapefruit, eucalyptus leaves, and black tea extract have been used to synthesize (Ramezani, Kazemi et al. 2013).However, there is considerable interest in the biogenesis of metal nanoparticles using plant and microbial extracts.

        <p>To enhance the stability of nano molecules on supporting materials such as gold, oxides, titanium, polymers, fibres, metals and activated carbon acceleration of the removal of the nanomaterials from aqueous media is required. Among the above, the utilization of passive carbon has driven economic benefits and ecological considerations (Ghaedi, Ghayedi et al. 2013). Activated carbon (AC) synthesized by plant biomass has high active sites, cheap, renewability, favourable surface area, properties of surface chemistry, porous, and therefore has involved enormous consideration. However, commercial AC has been proved expensive. Therefore, there is an essence for economically affordable materials that could be an alternative for the commercially available AC.To enhance the stability of nano molecules on supporting materials such as gold, oxides, titanium, polymers, fibres, metals and activated carbon acceleration of the removal of the nanomaterials from aqueous media is required.

This analysis was performed by BET device Quanta Chrome Instruments, CHEMBET 3000 was used for analysis. Fig. 3 displays the BET analysis of AC/nZVI nanocomposite. It can be seen through the surface analysis graph that adsorbed volume of AC/nZVI is more than AC which reveals that nanocomposites have more adsorption capacity than AC. Table 1, shows that the nanocomposite AC/nZVI porosity is more than AC. The specific surface area of AC and nanocomposite is calculated as 731.12 and 821.74 m 2 /g, respectively.

This result explains that by adding nZVI to the AC, the surface-modified and the adsorbent surface area increased that ultimately effects the absorption rate (Mohseni, Khalilzadeh et al. 2020).BET analysis was performed to examine the pore volume and surface area by assessing the volume of nitrogen gas (N2) absorbed and desorbed by the material surface at a constant temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K) (Esmaeili Bidhendi, Poursorkh et al. 2020). This analysis was performed by BET device Quanta Chrome Instruments, CHEMBET 3000 was used for analysis. Fig. 3 displays the BET analysis of AC/nZVI nanocomposite. It can be seen through the surface analysis graph that adsorbed volume of AC/nZVI is more than AC which reveals that nanocomposites have more adsorption capacity than AC.

        <p>pH is the most important parameter in the adsorption process. that increasing the pH from 2 to 12, the adsorption of furfural on nanocomposites AC/nZVI surface has also increased. With the reaction time of 1 h at a concentration of 250 mg/L the maximum removal was attained at pH 3,5,7,9, and 11. It was observed that the efficiency of removal under neutral pH parameters is slightly more than the alkaline and acidic conditions. pH at 7 was selected as the optimum pH. The AC-nZVI at pH &lt; pHpzc, had a positive charge and in pH &gt; pHpzc, it had a negative charge. As a result, in solutions with a pH &lt; 6.76, the nanocomposite had a positive charge at its surface, while the furfural dye molecules were negatively charged. The decline in pH is due to the increase of H + ions in the solution. Furthermore, the formation of electrostatic attraction between the H + ion and the dye increases that ultimately increases the adsorption rate as well. If nanocomposite had a negative charge due to pH &gt; 6.76, therefore, the anionic dye and the adsorbent repelled as reported earlier.pH is the most important parameter in the adsorption process. that increasing the pH from 2 to 12, the adsorption of furfural on nanocomposites AC/nZVI surface has also increased.

        <p>The qmax decreased with increasing dose therefore the qmax of furfural declined from 111.42 mg/g to 34.72 mg/g therefore, the optimum dose of 4 g/L was selected. With increasing the adsorbent dose, the increment in furfural efficiency is calculated, which changes faster in the 4 g/L adsorbent dose. After 4 g/L, the removal efficiency has been a slowdown and almost constant process. The increment in the adsorption rate is mainly based upon the surface sorption area and the interaction of the furfural with the nanocomposite. Increased furfural uptake occurs to increase the adsorbent dose due to the increment in positive sites, the increase in the adsorbent surface, and the presence of a strong driving force of the adsorbent to remove furfural (Fang and Yang 2021). Less active sites are present to adsorb the furfural molecules at low doses of adsorbent, which leads to a decrease in the efficiency of furfural removal (Shaban, Hassouna et al. 2017).The qmax decreased with increasing dose therefore the qmax of furfural declined from 111.42 mg/g to 34.72 mg/g therefore, the optimum dose of 4 g/L was selected.

        <p>An influential factor in removal percentage is initial furfural concentration and reaction contact time with adsorbent. To determine the optimized contact time for solvent adsorption in the limit of 350-100 mg/L under pH kept at 7 and the amount of adsorbent 4 g/L, was evaluated at times from 0 to 120 min. The stirrer speed was kept at 250 rpm and the experimentation was performed at 25 °C temperature. The adsorbent removal was performed at high speed in 60 min and then increased with a gentle slope to 120 min and reached almost equilibrium. Therefore, the adsorbent optimal contact time was chosen to be 60 min to provide optimum time for furfural to be adsorbed on the surface. The rate of pollutant diffusion into the pores decreases, followed by the adsorption rate. Initially, the surfaces available to absorb the contaminant on the adsorbent are completely free and as a result, the adsorbent is in contact with the contaminant with all surfaces and over time the available surfaces become less and thus the adsorption rate decreases (Fang and Yang 2021).An influential factor in removal percentage is initial furfural concentration and reaction contact time with adsorbent.

        <p>Fig. 6 shows furfural separation from aqueous solution by the initial concentration of the adsorbent. It was revealed that at the equilibrium time of 60 min the capacity of furfural removal was declined by increasing furfural concentration. As the furfural concentration increment from 100 to 250 mg/L, the furfural removal efficiency increased from 85.9 to 90.93%, respectively. By increasing the initial furfural concentration, the number of collisions increases with the nanoparticles which increase the rate of adsorption and render a high surface area for adsorption of furfural (Fazlzadeh, Rahmani et al. 2017). This may be owed to the several active sites on the adsorbent that becomes saturated at higher concentrations of furfural. In other words, at low concentrations, the availability of the active AC/nZVI sites to the furfural molecules is more than when high concentrations of furfural are involved (Adio, Omar et al. 2017).Fig. 6 shows furfural separation from aqueous solution by the initial concentration of the adsorbent.

The improvement in surface adsorption of the AC is due to the AC and nZVI interaction. Presently, from several methods, adsorption is considered an auspicious treatment to remove many defiant furfurals. Based on Table 4, furfural removal has been studied by many researchers in aqueous environments via several adsorbents such as torrefied biomass, MCM-48, and Organo bentonite. These adsorbents give the solvent removal up to 61% which is low than the results obtained by nZVI that is up to 81.87%. On the other end, the separation of the furfural desorption process is a favourable method. Moderate costs and nontoxicity are the benefits of the desorption method as compared to other methods. with highly separation capacity, other benefits include its low costs and non-toxicity. in comparison to other adsorbents, it is a new composite that can be used for adsorption processes but still there is room for improvement to achieve better results.were obtained using adsorption AC/nZVI and AC, respectively.
