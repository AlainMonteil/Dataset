        <p>The persistent presence of heavy metals in drinking water, and industrial wastes, has been identified as a global health problem, as these species cannot be biologically degraded like organic contaminants.</p>
        <p>As a consequence, the removal of heavy metals from water systems has attracted significant attention, which has increased in recent years, with a growing understanding of the toxicity of these species towards human health, aquatic life, flora and fauna [1].</p>
        <p>Cadmium has been identified as a major heavy metal pollutant, with a proven high degree of toxicity at very low exposure levels, which can result in acute disorders and various chronic diseases by accumulation in living organisms [2]. This metal is discharged from central industries, like the mining, oil refineries, metal plating, batteries, alloy industries, smelting, phosphate fertilisers and pigments [3][4][5], resulting in cadmium contaminated water courses.</p>
        <p>Adsorption by biomaterials has been proven to be highly effective for the removal of pollutants, including heavy metals from water and wastewater streams, with associated economic benefits, making it a potential alternative treatment route, preferable to conventional techniques such as ion This is a peer-reviewed, accepted author manuscript of the following chapter: Fletcher, A., Hashem, A., Farag, S., Taha, G., Badawy, S., &amp; Mohamed, L.

        <p>3 exchange, precipitation, reverse osmosis and electrode position. Activated carbon is a relatively inexpensive material, which has been used extensively as an adsorbent in wastewater treatment systems but it is unsuitable for developing countries due to the operational cost of such processes [6][7][8].</p>
        <p>Agricultural waste materials offer potential adsorbents in the removal of heavy metals from wastewater [9] and the use of such free resources, which are widely available and incur low processing costs, offers an alternative to the comparatively costly activated carbon, while retaining the favourable physico-chemical properties often associated with latter adsorbents. Sawdust is a natural resource, mainly consisting of cellulose and lignin that has high adsorption capacity for pollutants [10,11], and has potential for adsorption of key pollutants, such as, heavy metals, oils, dyes and toxic salts from water.</p>
        <p>In recent years, modified cellulosic materials has been widely investigated, where potential functional groups are introduced into the material by reaction with hydroxyl moieties present on the backbone of the cellulose chain, which can improve adsorption, or covalent binding, of metal ions [12].</p>
        <p>Polysulfide treated sawdust was very effective for the removal of divalent cobalt from aqueous solution [13], while copper-impregnated sawdust exhibits significant arsenic(III) removal [14]. Sawdust treated with phosphates has proven more effective for chromium removal as opposed to untreated sawdust [15]. Dye-treated sawdust was used long time ago for the removal of heavy metal ions from waste water, [16,17]. The esterification process increases the carboxylic content of the wood fibre surface leading to a corresponding increase in the sorption of divalent metal ions [18]. The cadmium(II) binding capacity of the modified sawdust with carboxyl groups using succinic anhydride could reach uptakes of up to 169 mg g -1 [19]. The amidoximated sawdust had a high adsorption capacity for Cu(II) of 246 mg g -1 and for Ni(II) of 188 mg g -1 [20]. The modified sawdusts using polyacrylic chains possessed 15-40 times higher adsorption capacity for Cu(II), Ni(II) and Cd(II) than the unmodified sawdusts [21].

        <p>adsorption isotherms describe the phenomenon governing the mobility of a substance from the aqueous porous media or aquatic environments to a solid-phase at a constant temperature and pH [22,23].</p>
        <p>Based on this rationale, this work is aimed at the modification of sawdust with maleic acid to enhance the adsorption capacity of the resulting material for the removal of Cd(II)ions from aqueous solutions.</p>
        <p>The effects of altering selected reaction conditions, such as pH, contact time and temperature, on the adsorption capacity of the modified sawdust were investigated, and non-linear regression methods were determine the most appropriate thermodynamic and kinetic adsorption models for this system.</p>
        <p>Pinewood sawdust (SD), obtained from local wood manufacturing companies, was washed with distilled water several times to remove any adhered particles, and subsequently dried at 353 K for 24 h, and sieved to pass through a 50-150 μm mesh. Adsorbent structure and surface moieties were characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDX) analysis. Cadmium acetate, EDTA, maleic acid, acetic acid, sodium carbonate, acetone and ethyl alcohol were supplied as lab grade chemicals from Merck (Germany), and used as received.</p>
        <p>The adsorbent was prepared by placing 2 g of SD powder in a beaker and adding a known weight of maleic acid pre-dissolved in water; the resulting mixture was stirred with a spatula. The homogeneous paste obtained was dried in an oven at 373 -413 K, before subsequent cooling to room temperature.</p>
        <p>The sample was washed periodically with a solution of ethanol/water (80:20) for 2 h to remove any unreacted maleic acid and soluble by-products, before drying at 333 K for 4 h.</p>
        <p>A weighed quantity of adsorbent (0.05 g) was added to 100 mL of a Cd(II) ion solution (100-1000 mg L -1 ) in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask. 0.1 M HNO3 or 0.1 M NaOH was added dropwise to adjust pH values and the mixture shaken at constant speed (150 rpm) at 303 K for a pre-defined period of time, before filtering to separate the metal ion solutions. The concentration of Cd(II) ions was measured before and after adsorption, using direct titration with a standard EDTA solution (0.0005 M).</p>
        <p>The amount of adsorbed Cd(II) at equilibrium, qe (mg g -1 ) was calculated using:</p>
        <p>While the percentage removal was calculated via:</p>
        <p>where Co and Ce (mg L -1 ) are the initial metal concentration and metal concentration at equilibrium, respectively; W (g) is the weight of adsorbent used; and V is the volume of Cd(II) solution (0.1 L).</p>
        <p>The pH at zero charge (pHpzc) of the adsorbent sample, also known as the point of zero charge, is the point at which the initial pH value (pHinitial) equals the final pH of the solution (pHfinal). This was determined by adjusting the initial pH value (pHinitial) of 100 ml of 0.01N NaCl solutions in the range 2-12, using 0.01 N HCl solution and 0.01 N NaOH. A 0.1 g of the adsorbent sample was added into each 0.01N NaCl solution adjusted to a constant initial pH value. After 24 h, to allow for equilibration, the final pH of the solution (pHfinal) was recorded and plotted against pHinitial.</p>
        <p>FTIR spectroscopy was used to determine the functional moieties present on the surface of the SD adsorbents before and after treatment with maleic acid, and after loading with Cd(II) ions. The 6 averaged FTIR spectra were recorded over 4000-400 cm -1 (scan interval: 1 cm -1 , number of scans: 120) using KBr discs containing 2-10 mg of sample in 300 mg of KBr, on Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer Carboxyl group contents of the adsorbent samples were estimated [24] by adding 0.2 g of the adsorbent to a 125 mL flask containing 50 mL of NaOH solution (0.03 N). The flasks were left overnight at room temperature, after which their contents were titrated with standard HCl solution (0.01 N) using a phenolphthalein indicator. The carboxyl content of the adsorbent sample was subsequently calculated using:</p>
        <p>where Vo is the volume of HCl (mL) consumed without the addition of the adsorbent in a blank experiment, Vi is the volume of HCl (mL) consumed in the back titration of the adsorbent containing solution, N is the normality of the standard HCl solution (0.XX N), and W is the weight of the adsorbent sample (0.2 g).</p>
        <p>The samples studied by SEM were coated with a thin layer of gold using a diode sputter unit, before analysis using a scanning electron microscope (model JEOL-JSM-5600), at an accelerating voltage of 7</p>
        <p>Textural characterization of materials used in this study was performed using nitrogen adsorption isotherms measured at 77 K, using a Micromeritics ASAP 2420. Isotherms were used to calculate specific surface areas, total pore volumes, etc. (see Supporting Information).</p>
        <p>The experimental isotherm data obtained in this study were analysed using four isotherm models based on two parameters, i.e. Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich and Temkin, and four isotherm models based on three parameters, i.e. Sips, Redlich-Peterson, Khan and Toth.</p>
        <p>The Langmuir Equation [25] is based on monolayer adsorption with a fixed number of localised sites;</p>
        <p>the model refers to homogeneous adsorption, meaning that the adsorption activation energy and the enthalpies evolved by each adsorbate molecule are equal, in addition there are no interactions between neighbouring adsorbate molecules, nor any site to site movement of adsorbed species. The non-linear form of the Langmuir isotherm is:</p>
        <p>where Ce is the concentration of Cd (II) ions adsorbed at equilibrium, mg L -1 , qe is the amount of Cd (II) ions adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent (mg g -1 ), KL (L g -1 ) and b (L mg -1 ) are constants, and the ratio b/kL gives the maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) in mg g -1 . The essential characteristics of Langmuirian behaviour can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless separation factor, RL, [26] represented by: 8</p>
        <p>The Freundlich isotherm can be applied to systems that exhibit multilayer adsorption, mathematically predicting infinite surface coverage at high adsorptive concentrations, and accounts for surface heterogeneity, where the strongest binding sites are occupied first, and the total amount adsorbed is the cumulative adsorption across all surface sites. The decrease in heats of adsorption across all surface sites is assumed to be logarithmic, and the logarithmic form of the model is [27]:</p>
        <p>where Ce and qe are as defined above, and KF and n are constants related to the adsorption capacity and favourability, respectively.</p>
        <p>The Temkin isotherm model [28] assumes that there is a linear decrease in the distribution of heats of adsorption across all surface sites due to adsorbate/adsorbent interactions, rather than the logarithmic trend assumed in the Freundlich model. The non-linear Temkin isotherm model is represented by:</p>
        <p>where Ce and qe are as defined above, AT is the Temkin isotherm constant (L g -1 ), bT is a constant related to the heat of adsorption (J mol -1 ), T is absolute temperature (K), and R is the universal gas constant(8.314 J mol -1 K -1 ).</p>
        <p>The Dubinin-Radushkevich model was developed for adsorption onto a heterogeneous surface where the energy of sites is Gaussian distribution. The non-linear Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model is [29]:</p>

Non-linear adsorption characteristics of modified pine wood sawdust optimised for adsorption of Cd(II) from aqueous systems. Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.</p>
        <p>Where Ce and qe are as defined above, BD is a constant related to the free energy of adsorption per mole of adsorbate (mol 2 kJ -2 ), qD is a constant related to the degree of adsorption on the adsorbent surface, T is absolute temperature (K). The mean free energy per adsorbate molecule, E (kJ mol -1 ), can be calculated using:</p>
        <p>2.4.2. Three-parameter isotherm models</p>
        <p>The Redlich-Peterson isotherm model [30] combines features from both the Freundlich the Langmuir isotherm models. The non-linear Redlich-Peterson equation is represented by:</p>
        <p>where Ce and qe are as defined above, A (L g -1 ) and B are constants, and g is an exponent constant that lies between 1 and 0; when g = 1, Eq. ( 12) reduces to the Langmuir equation, and when g= 0, Eq. ( 12)</p>
        <p>reduces to Henry's equation, where A/(1+B) is the Henry's constant.</p>
        <p>The Toth isotherm model [31] is another form used to describe heterogeneous adsorption system; it differs by satisfying both low-and high-end concentration boundaries, as expressed by:</p>
        <p>This is a peer-reviewed, accepted author manuscript of the following chapter: Fletcher, A., Hashem, A., Farag, S., Taha, G., Badawy, S., &amp; Mohamed, L. (Accepted/In press). Non-linear adsorption characteristics of modified pine wood sawdust optimised for adsorption of Cd(II) from aqueous systems. Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.</p>
        <p>where Ce and qe are as defined above, KT is a constant, aT is the maximum adsorption capacity, and 1 /t is the Toth exponent constant. It should be noted that this isotherm model reduces to the Langmuir isotherm model, when t is close to unity.</p>
        <p>The Sips isotherm model [32] is a combined form of the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models.</p>
        <p>The Sips model can be represented by:</p>
        <p>where Ce and qe are as defined above, ks (L g -1 ) and as (L mg -1 ) are constants, and Bs is the Sips model exponent. This model reduces to the Freundlich isotherm model at low adsorptive concentrations, and predicts monolayer adsorption, characteristic of the Langmuir isotherm model, at high adsorptive concentrations.</p>
        <p>The Khan isotherm model [33] was first proposed to describe the adsorption of aromatics on activated carbons, but is also applicable to the system studied here, and is expressed by:</p>
        <p>where Ce and qe are as defined above, bk is a constant, ak is the model exponent, and qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity (mg g -1 ).</p>
        <p>In order to determine the most accurate model of the isothermal data obtained in this study, the error distribution between the experimental data and the data derived from predicted isotherm models This is a peer-reviewed, accepted author manuscript of the following chapter: Fletcher, A., Hashem, A., Farag, S., Taha, G., Badawy, S., &amp; Mohamed, L.

            <rs type="software">Excel</rs>.
        </p>
        <p>The optimization procedure for the isotherm studies requires an error function to be defined to evaluate the fit of the isotherm model to the experimental equilibrium data. The common error functions used here to optimise the isotherm parameters were: average relative error (ARE), average percentage error (APE%), hybrid fractional error function (HYBRID),a determinant of the quality of the fit ( 2 ), and normalised standard deviation (∆q%) [34][35][36][37][38] (Table 1).</p>

        <p>The kinetic process of the pseudo-first order is usually considered physical adsorption and is diffusion controlled. The non-linear mathematical form of the pseudo-first-order model [39] is given by:</p>
        <p>where qt is the amount of Cd(II) ions adsorbed (mg g -1 ) at time t (min), qe is the amount of Cd(II) ions adsorbed (mg g -1 ) at equilibrium, and k1 is the rate constant of adsorption (min -1 ).</p>
        <p>The pseudo-second order kinetic model [46]can be expressed by:</p>
        <p>where qt, qe and t are as defined above, and k2 (g mg -1 min -1 ) is the rate constant for the kinetic model.</p>
        <p>This model assumes that the rate of adsorption is controlled by the sharing of electrons between the adsorbent and adsorbate, i.e. a chemical process. The intraparticle diffusion model is not appropriate for studies at high adsorption times. To understand the adsorption mass transfer, the use of approximated models like Weber-Morris (intraparticle diffusion model), is not recommended. Weber-Morris is only valid for short adsorption times and when the bulk concentration is little affect. 13</p>
        <p>Bangham's kinetic model [40] is expressed by:</p>
        <p>where qt, qe and t are as defined above, and kb and n are constants.</p>
        <p>The Elovich kinetic model [41] is expressed by:</p>
        <p>where qt and t are as defined above, α (mg g -1 min -1 ) is the initial rate of adsorption and β (g mg -1 ) is the desorption constant related to the activation energy of chemisorption, and the extent of surface coverage. Figure 2 shows SEM images of SD, SDTMA and SDTMA loaded with Cd(II) ions, at a magnification of 800x. SD appears to be a heterogeneous fibrous structure consisting of rough surface having irregular neat layers shapes with pores and cavities that, in nature, would facilitate the diffusion of an adsorptive and provide a high contact area for adsorption of metal ions (Figure 2a). The fibrous structure, and the fibres themselves, are not intrinsically damaged by maleic acid esterification (Figure 2b). Esterification seems to result in a change in the orientation and length of the fibres to shorter and well-ordered structures. The chemical substitution of cellulose damages some favourable properties of the structure, such as porosity. The average size of the pores, evaluated from the magnified image, was found to be 5 μm, and these materials present a suitable morphology to retain metal ions. SEM of SDTMA after the adsorption of Cd(II) ions (Figure 2c) seems to show a number of white precipitates on the surface of the fibres, which can be ascribed to adhesion of Cd(II) ions via favourable interactions 16 of the metal ions with ester functional groups of the sample, as supported by EDX analysis, which</p>
        <p>shows the appearance of Cd signals in the white precipitates (Figure 3).

Non-linear adsorption characteristics of modified pine wood sawdust optimised for adsorption of Cd(II) from aqueous systems. Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering. The reaction mechanisms for cellulose with maleic acid to form a bond through carboxyl group was described in figure 1.The maleic anhydride may react partially with wood, when a single ester function and a free carboxylic group result, or completely to form di-ester structures [44].</p>
        <p>The hydroxyl groups at C-2, C-3 and C-6 of cellulose are reactive and can react with anhydride.</p>
        <p>The intensity of the peak at 3322 cm -1 reduced obviously, indicating that more intermolecular hydrogen bond is destructed compared to the intramolecular hydrogen bond [45,46].

        <p>Figure 5 shows the effect MA concentration on the extent of functional group incorporation, expressed as m.eq.-COOH 100 g -1 SDTMA, for treatment of SD particles with different concentrations of MA. There is, as expected, an increase in carboxyl group concentration, 71.7 to 234.6 m.eq. 100 g -1</p>
        <p>SDTMAwith increasing MA concentration (4.3 to 69 mmol L -1 ), the observed trend is an initial sharp increase with an approach to a plateau at higher MA concentration. As the availability of maleic acid molecules in contact with the SD increases, this results in increasing carboxyl content by reaction with the hydroxyl groups present in the parent material, after which carboxyl groups are converted to anhydride groups by dehydration at higher temperatures. 21 subsequent increase in temperature, above 403 K, results in a decrease in carboxyl content after the maximum is achieved. It is likely that the carboxyl content of SDTMA is enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature to 403 K, as both (1) conversion of MA to MAA and (2) reaction of MAA with cellulosic hydroxyls of SD particles are favoured by higher temperatures. On the other hand, SDTMA is decarboxylated at temperatures higher than 403K.</p>
        <p>Figure 7 shows the variation in carboxyl content of SDTMA with changing reaction time. The carboxyl content of SDTMA increases from 225.4 to 242.9 m.eq. 100 g -1 SDTMAas reaction time increases from 30 to 60 min, before a subsequent decrease is observed at higher reaction times. It is evident that increased time results in increased formation of MAA, which reacts with cellulosic hydroxyl groups to form the carboxyl functionalities observed in the final product of SDTMA. Further time within the reaction system results in catalytic effects on the carboxyl groups and their concentration is decreased, resulting in a final value of 210.71 m.eq. 100 g -1 SDTMAobserved at300 min [47]. Reaction conditions: sawdust mass: 2 g; particle size range: 50-125 μm; maleic acid concentration: 51.7 mmol L -1 ; reaction temperature 403 K; carboxyl content: 247 m.eq. 100 g -1 sample.</p>
        <p>The results of studies into the effect of pH on the adsorption of Cd(II) ions by SDTMA, in the range pH 3-7, and an initial cadmium ion concentration of 200 mg L -1 , are shown in Figure 8.The adsorption of Cd(II) increased from 23 to 136 mg g -1 with increasing pH, up to 6, before a plateau is achieved at higher pH. This increase is attributed to ion-exchange processes:</p>
        <p>Deprotonation of SDTMA, the first stage in ion exchange, is shown in Equation 4; the products of which offer adsorption sites for the Cd(II) ions (Equation 5). As can be seen from Figure 8, the adsorption capacity (qe) of SDTMA towards Cd(II) ions was zero at pH 3, as the presence of a higher concentration of protons causes the equilibrium in Equation 4</p>
        <p>subsequently increases as the pH becomes less acidic, with a maximum at pH 6. After this point the uptake decreases again, as there is a significant precipitation reaction of cadmium as hydroxide. for Cd(II) ions. Reaction conditions: adsorptive concentration: 300 mg L -1 ; adsorbent dose: 0.3 g L -1 ;</p>
        <p>particle size range: 50-125; contact time: 2h; adsorption temperature, 403 K.</p>
        <p>Figure 9 shows the pHpzc data obtained for the surface of SDTMA, which allows the pH at which the surface of SDTMA has neutral charge to be determined. At solution pHs higher than this point of neutrality, the surface will be on the whole negatively charged, likewise, the surface will be positively charged in the main at solution pHs lower than pHpzc [48]. Additionally, pHpzc provides an indication of the electrostatic interactions that occur between the adsorbent surface and the adsorbate [49].The pHpzc of SDTMA was determined as 4, which indicates an acidic nature for the surface of SDTMA. As aforementioned, higher pH values will result in a negative charge on the surface of SDTMA, which favours the binding of cations; conversely, lower pH values will cause a positively charged surface, which makes the adsorption of cations unfavourable [50]. As stated in the previous section, the optimum pH for SDTMA to adsorb Cd(II) from solution is 6, which is higher than pHpzc, and leads to a predominantly negative surface charge on the adsorbent surface, resulting in electrostatic attraction with the positively charged Cd(II) cations [51].</p>

        <p>The effect of adsorption contact time on the capacity of SDTMA towards Cd(II) ions, at an initial adsorptive concentration of 200 mg L -1 , is shown in Figure 10. The capacity of SDTMA to adsorb Cd(II) ions increased with increasing contact time, up to an equilibrium at 45 min, after which a plateau is observed and no further improvement is achieved. This equilibrium time is relatively short [52], which is an important consideration in the development of an economically viable wastewater treatment system.</p>
        <p>It has been previously observed, in many studies, that adsorbent dose influences the uptake of target species from solution, including metal ions. The effect of adsorbent dose on the adsorption capacity of SDTMA for Cd(II) ions was studied at pH 6, using adsorbent doses in the range 0.5-8 g L -1 , and an initial metal ion concentration of 200 mg L -1 (Figure 11). It can be seen that the adsorption capacity (qe) of Cd(II) ions, per gram of adsorbent (mg g -1 ), decreased from 157.1 to 48 mg g -1 with increasing adsorbent dose, up to 7 g L -1 . With increasing the adsorbent dose, increasing of unsaturated adsorption sites take places, as a result a decrease per unit mass and adsorption capacity of SDTMA for Cd(II) ions decreases, as has been observed previously for Zn(II) [9].</p>

The isothermal data analysed was obtained for adsorption of Cd(II) ions onto SDTMA, at pH 6, allowing an equilibrium time of 60 min.</p>
        <p>The maximum adsorption capacity for Cd(II) ions onto SDTMA, according to the Langmuir isotherm model, was 180.4 mg g -1 . Table 2 shows that the SDTMA produced within the present work has a high affinity for the removal of Cd(II) ions (180 mg/g) from solution when compared with Table 3 shows that the two-parameter isotherm models are ordered, in terms of best fit to the experimental data, as: Langmuir&gt; Freundlich &gt; Dubinin-Radushkevich&gt; Temkin; while Table 4 shows that the three-parameter isotherm models were determined to be in the order: Sips &gt; Khan&gt; Toth &gt; Redlich-Peterson, for the best fit to the data. As may be expected from the increase if fitting variables, the three-parameter models were consistently found to provide a better fit to the experimental data than two-parameter models. Overall, the eight isotherm models can be presented in the following order of fitness, based on the correlation coefficient (R 31</p>
        <p>In addition to studying the equilibrium behaviour of adsorption systems, it is critical to understand their approach to this equilibrium by also studying the kinetics of adsorption, which can provide insight into the mechanism of adsorption. In this work, five models were used to model the kinetics of Cd(II)adsorption onto SDTMA: pseudo-first-order, pseudo second-order, Bangham, Elovich. The intraparticle diffusion model is not appropriate for studies at high adsorption times. To understand the adsorption mass transfer, the use of approximated models like Weber-Morris (intraparticle diffusion model), is not recommended. Weber-Morris is only valid for short adsorption times and when the bulk concentration is little affect. The Kinetic parameters calculated for this study and normalized standard deviation (∆q(%)) for adsorption of Cd (II) ions onto SDTMA at 303 K are summarised in Table 5.</p>
        <p>The highest R 2 and lowest ∆q% values were obtained for the pseudo second-order kinetic model, and</p>
        <p>indicate that this provides the best fit model to the experimental data for the kinetics of Cd(II) adsorption onto SDTMA (Figure 14), suggesting chemical control of the adsorption process. Overall, the results obtained from the five kinetic models show that the adsorption kinetic models can be ordered: pseudo second-order&gt; Bangham&gt; intra-particle &gt; pseudo first-order &gt; Elovich for the quality of fit that they provide for the adsorption of Cd(II) ions onto SDTMA. It can be concluded that the adsorption process obeyed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the adsorption isotherm followed sips isotherm equation, demonstrating that the adsorption process of Cd(II) onto SDTMA is heterogeneous adsorption systems and dominated by the chemical adsorption.</p>
        <p>The process of metal ion remediation from aqueous systems by agricultural adsorbents is still not fully understood due to the different interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent, and the nature of the adsorbent structure. In this study, cadmium hydroxide Cd(OH)2 is the dominant form of the Cd(II) species in solution at pH &gt; 7., while the dominant species at pH &lt; 7 are Cd(OH) + and Cd 2+ ions.</p>
        <p>The adsorption capacity is affected by the interaction of the adsorbent surface with these metal ion species. The highest adsorption capacity of SDTMA for Cd (II) ions was observed at pH 6, which is close to the pH based on zeta potential analysis. Thus, the interaction of dominant species (Cd 2+ and Cd(OH) + ) at pH &lt; 7, with the functional groups on the SDTMA surface, leads to an enhanced adsorption capacity at this optimum pH. The adsorption mechanism of porous adsorbents includes diffusion of ions to the external surface and into the pores of adsorbent, before ion exchange with the hydrogen ions associated with the carboxyl groups in SDTMA. The mechanism of CD(II) ion adsorption by SDTMA could also be due to complexation (Scheme 2), as well as physisorption and ion-exchange, and this may explain the results observed for adsorbent dosing, where increased accessibility of carboxyl groups from additional SDTMA may well increase the amount of complexation within the system.</p>
        <p>The proposed complex structure formed between pinewood sawdust treated with maleic acid (SDTMA) and Cd(II) ions.</p>
        <p>The adsorbent prepared within this study (SDTMA), formed via the treatment of pinewood sawdust isotherm models, with goodness of fit determined using the nonlinear regression. Analysis showed that the Sips model provided the best fit of the experimental data, while the maximum adsorption capacity was 180.4 mg g -1 , at 303 K and adsorption was a favourable process. The kinetics of adsorption of Cd(II) onto SDTMA were analysed using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich and Bangham kinetic models, with the data described well by the pseudo second-order model, suggesting overall chemical control of the adsorption process, which may be controlled by a combination of physisorption, ion-exchange and complexation. Consequently, SDTMA has been shown to be an effective adsorbent for the removal of Cd(II) ions from aqueous solutions, and demonstrates the potential of agricultural wastes in water remediation processes.</p>

        <p>wood sawdust raw materials (41 mg/g) and other various adsorbents previously reported in the literature [42,[53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62]. Figure 12 shows a comparison between the experimental isothermal data obtained in this study and the theoretical fits offered by the different two-and three-parameter isotherm models described above. Additionally, Tables 3 and4 present the error analysis and constants for the isotherm models used here. Isotherm type is determined by the value of RL determined from the Langmuir model data;</p>
        <p>irreversible when RL = 0, favourable for 0 &lt; RL &lt; 1, linear if RL = 1, or unfavourable in the case of RL &gt; 1.</p>
        <p>The calculated factor of dimensionless separation for Cd(II) ions onto SDTMA is 0.28, while RL was greater than zero but less than 1, therefore, indicating favourable adsorption.</p>
        <p>The value of n in the Freundlich model (Table 3) was 4.18, satisfying 0 &lt; n &lt; 10, which also indicates that adsorption of Cd(II) ions onto SDTMA is favourable. The value of 1 /n &lt; 1 suggests a slight suppression of adsorption at lower equilibrium concentrations.</p>
