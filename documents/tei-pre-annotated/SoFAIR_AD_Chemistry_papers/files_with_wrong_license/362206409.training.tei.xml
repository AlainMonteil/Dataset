        <p>We analyse the large-scale clustering in Fourier space of emission line galaxies (ELG) from the Data Release 16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. The ELG sample contains 173 736 galaxies covering 1170 deg 2 in the redshift range 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.1. We perform a BAO measurement from the post-reconstruction power spectrum monopole, and study redshift space distortions (RSD) in the first three even multipoles. Photometric variations yield fluctuations of both the angular and radial survey selection functions. Those are directly inferred from data, imposing integral constraints which we model consistently. The full data set has only a weak preference for a BAO feature (1.4σ ). At the effective redshift z eff = 0.845 we measure D V (z eff )/r drag = 18.33 +0.57 -0.62 , with D V the volume-averaged distance and r drag the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch. In combination with the RSD measurement, at z eff = 0.85 we find f σ 8 (z eff ) = 0.289 +0.085 -0.096 , with f the growth rate of structure and σ 8 the normalization of the linear power spectrum, D H (z eff )/r drag = 20.0 +2.4 -2.2 and D M (z eff )/r drag = 19.17 ± 0.99 with D H and D M the Hubble and comoving angular distances, respectively. These results are in agreement with those obtained in configuration space, thus allowing a consensus measurement of fσ 8 (z eff ) = 0.315 ± 0.095, D H (z eff )/r drag = 19.6 +2.2 -2.1 and D M (z eff )/r drag = 19.5 ± 1.0.

        <p>Star-forming ELGs are an interesting tracer for clustering analyses. Indeed, the star formation rate increases up to z ∼ 2, where red galaxies are rarer. Also, the strong emission lines, such as H α or the [O II] doublet, ease the redshift measurement -thus allowing reduced spectroscopic observing time. The eBOSS ELG sample, with 173 736 galaxies distributed in the redshift range 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 (effective redshift of z eff = 0.845), is the largest and highest redshift ELG spectroscopic sample ever assembled and the third one to be used for cosmology (Blake et al. 2011;Contreras et al. 2013;Okumura et al. 2016). The eBOSS ELG sample has already been used to study the evolution of star-forming galaxies (Guo et al. 2019) and the circumgalactic medium of ELGs (Lan &amp; Mo 2018). Details about the eBOSS ELG target selection can be found in Raichoor et al. (2016Raichoor et al. ( , 2017)). The DR16 ELG clustering catalogue is described in Raichoor et al.

        <p>The RSD analysis of the observed galaxy power spectrum allows joint constraints to be derived on the product f(z eff )σ 8 (z eff ), and ratios D H (z eff )/r drag and D M (z eff )/r drag , at the effective redshift of the sample z eff . In these combinations, f(z) is the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth factor with respect to the scale factor a = 1/(1 + z) (hereafter referred to as the growth rate of structure) and σ 8 (z) is the amplitude of the linear matter power spectrum measured in spheres of radius 8 Mpc h -1 at redshift z. We also use D H (z) = c/H(z), the Hubble distance related to the Hubble expansion rate H(z), D M = (1 + z)D A (z), the comoving angular diameter distance related to the proper angular diameter distance D A and r drag the comoving sound horizon when the baryon-drag optical depth equals unity. The BAO only analysis is sensitive to D M /r drag , D H /r drag , or a combination of both terms.

        <p>The RSD model we use is based on state-of-the-art two-loop order perturbation theory to ensure reliable modelling of the power spectrum up to mildly non-linear scales. Besides the standard survey window function, we also model the radial integral constraint (RIC) generated by the survey radial selection function being estimated from observed data. We carefully review potential sources of systematic errors, and apply correction schemes after validation based on mock catalogues. After mitigation of systematic effects, we measure the first three even Legendre multipoles of the pre-reconstruction power spectrum and the post-reconstruction monopole and compare these measurements with model predictions to derive cosmological constraints. We combine isotropic BAO and RSD analyses at the likelihood level in order to release the Gaussian assumption on the posteriors and strengthen our cosmological measurement.The RSD model we use is based on state-of-the-art two-loop order perturbation theory to ensure reliable modelling of the power spectrum up to mildly non-linear scales.

The density contrast field δ g (r) in equation ( 1) is interpolated on a 512 3 mesh following the triangular shaped cloud (TSC) scheme. In the following (see Section 5), the box size is 3000 Mpc h -1 and thus the Nyquist frequency is k N 0.5 h Mpc -1 , more than twice larger than the maximum wavenumber used in the RSD analysis (k = 0.2 h Mpc -1 ). We checked that using a 700 3 mesh (k N 0.7 h Mpc -1 ) does not change our measurement in a detectable way. Then, the term δ g (k) in equation ( 2) is calculated with a fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the interpolated density contrast and the interlacing technique of Sefusatti et al. (2016) is used to mitigate aliasing effects.

        <p>The observed galaxy density is modulated by the survey selection function. The resulting window function effect is accounted for in the model using the formalism of Wilson et al. (2017), Beutler et al. (2017b), and correctly normalized following de Mattia &amp; Ruhlmann-Kleider (2019). Indeed, because of the fine-grained veto masks of the eBOSS ELG survey and the conventional choice made to estimate the survey area entering the redshift density estimation, the value of I in equation ( 8) used to normalize the power spectrum estimation in equation ( 6) is inaccurate. We thus use this value in the normalization of window functions in the model, so that I divides both the power spectrum measurements and model, and compensate. Therefore, the estimation of I does not impact the recovered cosmological parameters. Fig. 1 shows the window function multipoles of the EZ mocks (reproducing the eBOSS ELG sample, see Section 6.2): the monopole has a non-zero slope even below 5 Mpc h -1 due to the fine-grained veto masks. For comparison purposes, we also plot the window function without veto masks applied; in this case, the monopole stabilizes faster on small scales. The area entering the estimation of I used to normalize the unmasked window function has been kept fixed to the masked case. Since veto masks remove more area in the South Galactic Cap (SGC) than in the North Galactic Cap (NGC, see Raichoor et al. 2017), the unmasked SGC window function is relatively lower than the masked case compared to NGC. In Section 7, we further check that veto masks do not bias cosmological measurements with our treatment of the window function.The observed galaxy density is modulated by the survey selection function.

Eleven types of mocks were produced for each HOD; in addition to the baseline (type 1), these include 50 per cent variations in the halo concentration in dark matter and the velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies (types 2, 3, 4, and 5), a shift in the position of the central galaxy (type 6) and assembly bias prescriptions (types 7, 8, and 9). In the last two types of mocks (types 10 and 11), galaxy velocities were upscaled (downscaled) by 20 per cent, for which we thus expected a 20 per cent increase (decrease) of the fσ 8 measurement. The galaxy density reached 3 × 10 -3 (h/Mpc) 3 , about 10 times the mean eBOSS ELG density, such that the shot noise is very low.Dark matter haloes were populated with galaxies following two halo occupation distribution (HOD) models: a standard HOD (SHOD), and an HOD quenched at high mass (HMQ, see Alam et al. 2020 for details).

        <p>We derived a covariance matrix from a set of 500 lognormal mocks produced with nbodykit, in the MDPL2 cosmology of equation ( 33), assuming a bias of 1.4 and with the same density of 3 × 10 -3 (h/Mpc) 3 . We checked that the agreement between N-body based and lognormal mocks was satisfactory on the whole k-range of the cosmological fit.We derived a covariance matrix from a set of 500 lognormal mocks produced with nbodykit, in the MDPL2 cosmology of equation ( 33), assuming a bias of 1.4 and with the same density of 3 × 10 -3 (h/Mpc) 3 .

        <p>Both N-body based and lognormal mocks were analysed with the fiducial cosmology of equation ( 10), as for the eBOSS ELG data. We thus accounted for the appropriate window function and GIC effect (Section 3.5) in the model, and we included the correction for the irregular μ distribution (Section 3.3) at large scales. As reported in Alam et al. (2020, fig. 4), the fitted cosmological parameters were found to be within 1σ of the expected values, even for mocks with rescaled galaxy velocities, where the offset in the fitted fσ 8 values corresponds to the 20 per cent offset in velocity. However, the obtained uncertainties were only half of those expected with the eBOSS ELG sample, which was not sufficient to derive an accurate modelling systematic budget. We thus focused on larger mocks.Both N-body based and lognormal mocks were analysed with the fiducial cosmology of equation ( 10), as for the eBOSS ELG data.

        <p>A first set of mocks using the SHOD and HMQ HODs was produced, with six types, corresponding to types 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 11 of the MultiDark-based mocks, with a density between 3 × 10 -3 (h/Mpc) 3 (SHOD) and 4 × 10 -3 (h/Mpc) 3 (HMQ).A first set of mocks using the SHOD and HMQ HODs was produced, with six types, corresponding to types 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 11 of the MultiDark-based mocks, with a density between 3 × 10 -3 (h/Mpc) 3 (SHOD) and 4 × 10 -3 (h/Mpc) 3 (HMQ).</p>
        <p>A second set of OuterRim mocks was produced based on results from models of galaxy formation and evolution (Avila et al. 2020). Three different HODs were considered: the mean number of satellite galaxies was fixed to a power law (in the halo mass), but central galaxies followed either a smoothed step function (erf, HOD-1), a Gaussian (HOD-2) or a Gaussian extended by a decaying power law (baseline), based on results obtained by Gonzalez-Perez et al. (2018). The fraction of satellite galaxies f sat was varied. Satellites were either directly assigned the positions and velocities of random particles in the dark matter halo (part.) or they were sampled from a Navarro, Frenk &amp; White (1996) profile (NFW); in the latter case the virial theorem (Bryan &amp; Norman 1998;Avila et al. 2018) was used to sample velocities. The concentration was varied and the probability law for sampling satellites was also changed (Poisson, nearest integer, binomial, e.g. Jiménez et al. 2019). These variations led to minor changes in the fitted cosmological parameters. Finally, velocities of satellite galaxies were biased with respect to dark matter by a factor α v (α v = 1 in the baseline case), which is referred to as the satellite velocity bias (Guo et al. 2015), or were given an infall component following a Gaussian of mean v t = 500 km s -1 and dispersion 200 km s -1 (Orsi &amp; Angulo 2018). The number density of the 24 mocks we analysed ranges between 2 × 10 -4 (h/Mpc) 3 (part. and some NFW) and 2 × 10 -3 (h/Mpc) 3 (NFW).A second set of OuterRim mocks was produced based on results from models of galaxy formation and evolution (Avila et al. 2020).

        <p>We analysed these mocks with the OuterRim cosmology, imposing periodic boundary conditions. Therefore, there is no window effect and we only included the correction for the irregular μ distribution (Section 3.5) at large scales. A Gaussian covariance matrix was calculated following Grieb et al.

        <p>We participated in a blind mock challenge dedicated to the ELG sample (see Alam et al. 2020, section 8). For simplicity, only velocities and HOD parameters were changed, while the background cosmology was kept fixed. Therefore, only the value of fσ 8 was blind. 30 to 40 realizations for each of the six types of mocks (three for SHOD and HMQ) were produced with a density of the order of the eBOSS ELG mean density [ 2 × 10 -4 (h/Mpc) 3 ]. The OuterRim boxes were analysed the same way as in Section 5.2. Though velocities were scaled by as much as 50 per cent, no significant systematic shift in fσ 8 could be seen, confirming the robustness of our RSD model.We participated in a blind mock challenge dedicated to the ELG sample (see Alam et al. 2020, section 8).

        <p>As Hou et al. ( 2020), Neveux et al. (2020), Gil-Marín et al. (2020), and Bautista et al. (2020), we test the dependence of the measurement of cosmological parameters with respect to the cosmology -dubbed as template cosmology -used to compute the linear power spectrum for the RSD model (P lin m (k), see Section 3.1). To this end, we reanalyse the first set of OuterRim mocks (types 1, 4, 5, and 6, with SHOD and HMQ HODs) presented in Section 5.2, but using different template cosmologies. We consider first the fiducial cosmology of the data analysis (10) and also scale each of the cosmological parameters (h, ω CDM , ω b , and n s ) of ( 34) by ±10 per cent to ±20 per cent [typically 30σ variations of Planck Collaboration VI (2018) CMB (TT, TE, EE, lowE, lensing) and BAO constraints].As Hou et al.

        <p>Note that for simplicity we do not change the fiducial cosmology (34) used in the analysis (power spectrum estimation and Gaussian covariance matrix) and thus rescale the fitted α and α ⊥ accordingly to determine σ 8 as in Section 4.2.Note that for simplicity we do not change the fiducial cosmology (34) used in the analysis (power spectrum estimation and Gaussian covariance matrix) and thus rescale the fitted α and α ⊥ accordingly to determine σ 8 as in Section 4.2.</p>
        <p>Results are shown in Fig. 3. Scaling parameters are well recovered. The best-fitting fσ 8 value is primarily sensitive to the template h and n s values. Taking the root mean square of the difference (averaged over all types, HODs, and lines of sight) to the expected values gives the following systematic uncertainties: 2.6 per cent on fσ 8 and 0.4 per cent on scaling parameters. Note that without the σ 8 rescaling described in Section 4.2 the systematic uncertainties related to the choice of template cosmology would have been twice larger for fσ 8 .Results are shown in Fig. 3.

        <p>We also test the robustness of the isotropic BAO analysis with respect to variations in the HOD and template cosmology. Again, we consider the first set of OuterRim mocks (types 1, 4, 5, and 6, with SHOD and HMQ HODs) presented in Section 5.2, apply them reconstruction (with the parameters set in Section 4.1), and measure their power spectrum using the OuterRim cosmology (34).We also test the robustness of the isotropic BAO analysis with respect to variations in the HOD and template cosmology.

        <p>Using the isotropic BAO model described in Section 3.6, we first find (with the OuterRim cosmology as template cosmology) a damping parameter nl value of 8 Mpc h -1 (4 Mpc h -1 ) to fit the prereconstruction (post-reconstruction) power spectrum.

        <p>We then perform the post-reconstruction isotropic BAO fits with the different template cosmologies introduced in Section 5.4. Results are shown in Fig. 4. The measured α value shows very small dependence with the template cosmology, as also found in e.g. Carter et al. (2020). The same is true for the HOD model. Taking the root mean square of differences between best fit and expected values gives a systematic uncertainty of 0.2 per cent on α, which we take as BAO modelling systematics.We then perform the post-reconstruction isotropic BAO fits with the different template cosmologies introduced in Section 5.4.

        <p>In addition, in order to quantify how typical the data BAO measurements are (see Section 8.1), we generate accurate mocks designed to match the ELG sample survey geometry. An OuterRim box (satellite fraction of 0.14, no velocity bias) is trimmed to the eBOSS ELG footprint, including veto masks and radial selection function. We then cut six nearly independent mocks for NGC and SGC with three different orientations. The original box was replicated by 20 per cent to enclose the total SGC footprint. As the ELG density in the OuterRim box is much larger than the observed ELG density, we draw four disjoint random subsamples for each sky-cut mock. The number of galaxies in the mock samples match that of the data to better than 1 per cent. Then, we randomly generate 1000 fake mock power spectra following a multivariate Gaussian. The Gaussian mean comes from the pre-and postreconstruction power spectrum measurements of the above sky-cut OuterRim mocks, and its covariance matrix is given by the baseline EZ mocks. These fake post-reconstruction power spectra will be used to quantify the probability of the BAO measurements of the data in Section 8.1.In addition, in order to quantify how typical the data BAO measurements are (see Section 8.1), we generate accurate mocks designed to match the ELG sample survey geometry.

        <p>Contrary to other BOSS and eBOSS surveys making use of the SDSS-I-II-III optical imaging data, ELG targets were selected from the Data Release 3 and 5 of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS; Dey et al. 2019) in the grz bands (see Raichoor et al. 2017). DECaLS photometry, which is at least one magnitude deeper than the SDSS imaging in all bands, will be used by the next-generation survey Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI; Collaboration 2016). However, the homogeneity of the imaging quality over the eBOSS ELG footprint was not fully under control in this early version of DECaLS, a point we will further discuss below.Contrary to other BOSS and eBOSS surveys making use of the SDSS-I-II-III optical imaging data, ELG targets were selected from the Data Release 3 and 5 of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS; Dey et al. 2019) in the grz bands (see Raichoor et al. 2017).

        <p>A synthetic (random) catalogue is built to sample the survey selection function of the weighted data. Angular coordinates of the synthetic catalogue are uniformly random, and random objects outside the footprint, including veto masks, are removed. Data redshifts are assigned to random objects, following the shuffled scheme proposed in Ross et al. (2012). The previously mentioned anisotropies of the DECaLS imaging quality induce fluctuations of the eBOSS ELG redshift density which shall be introduced in the synthetic catalogue (Raichoor et al. 2020). We found the main driver for these fluctuations to be imaging depth. We therefore assign data redshifts to randoms in three separate sub-regions (dubbed chunk z) of each tiling chunk defined according to their value of imaging depth. The depth-bins are chosen such that the redshift distribution is considered sufficiently (i.e. within shot noise and cosmic variance) constant within each chunk z. In the synthetic catalogue, w sys,i accounts for the tiling completeness while w cp,i and w noz,i are all set to 1. w sys,i is then scaled such that the weighted number of random objects and data objects match in each chunk z.A synthetic (random) catalogue is built to sample the survey selection function of the weighted data.

We checked that this result varies by less than 0.4 per cent when including pairs between 0 and 200 Mpc h -1 . In Appendix B, we provide a definition of the effective redshift more specific to the power spectrum analysis, which quantitatively gives the same value as that adopted in equation ( 36). We also compute the effective redshift corresponding to the cuts 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, which will be used in Section 8: z eff = 0.857 for the combined NGC and SGC (NGC alone: 0.860, SGC alone: 0.853). The typical variation (using equation 10) corresponding to the 0.8 per cent difference between the effective redshift of NGC and SGC is 0.2 per cent on fσ 8 , 0.4 per cent on D H /r drag and 0.6 per cent on D M /r drag , small compared to the statistical uncertainty (see Section 8).

In Appendix B, we provide a definition of the effective redshift more specific to the power spectrum analysis, which quantitatively gives the same value as that adopted in equation ( 36). We also compute the effective redshift corresponding to the cuts 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, which will be used in Section 8: z eff = 0.857 for the combined NGC and SGC (NGC alone: 0.860, SGC alone: 0.853). The typical variation (using equation 10) corresponding to the 0.8 per cent difference between the effective redshift of NGC and SGC is 0.2 per cent on fσ 8 , 0.4 per cent on D H /r drag and 0.6 per cent on D M /r drag , small compared to the statistical uncertainty (see Section 8). Fig. 6 displays the power spectrum multipoles as measured on the data (blue curve). In the following sections, we briefly recap the creation of EZ and GLAM-QPM mocks, as well as the implementation and correction of observational systematics. For more details, we refer the reader to Raichoor et al. (2020).</p>
        <p>The generation of EZ mocks is detailed in Zhao et al. (2020a). The 1000 EZ mocks (NGC, SGC) are built from EZ boxes of side 5 Gpc h -1 , with a galaxy number density of 6.4 × 10 -4 (h/Mpc) 3 at different snapshots z snap = 0.658, 0.725, 0.755, 0.825, 0.876, 0.950, 1.047 used to cover the redshift ranges 0.6-0.7, 0.7-0.75, 0.75-0.8, 0.8-0.85, 0.85-0.9, 0.9-1.0, and 1.0-1.1, respectively. The fiducial cosmology of these mocks is that of the

        <p>Mocks are trimmed to the tiling geometry and veto masks. We implement in the mocks the observational systematics seen in the data. The data redshift distribution is applied to the mocks in each chunk z. We introduce angular systematics by trimming mock objects according to a map built from the data observed density with a Gaussian smoothing of radius 1 deg. Contaminants, such as stars, or objects outside the redshift range 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 are added to the catalogues, such that the target density matches in average that of the observed data. Fibre collisions are modelled using an extension of the Guo, Zehavi &amp; Zheng (2012) algorithm implemented in nbodykit, accounting for the plate overlaps and target priority. We include the TDSS (Ruan et al. 2016) targets ('FES' and 'RQS1') which were tiled at the same time as eBOSS ELGs. Finally, some objects are declared as redshift failures following their nearest neighbour in the observed data. All systematic corrections (weighting scheme and n(z) dependence in the imaging depth) are applied the exact same way to the mocks as in the data clustering catalogues.Mocks are trimmed to the tiling geometry and veto masks.

        <p>Fig. 7 shows the different systematics and corrections applied successively to the EZ mocks. One can already see that angular photometric systematics (photo) are the dominant ones. Another important effect is due to the shuffled scheme used to assign redshifts to randoms from the mock data redshift distribution, which leads to the aforementioned RIC, clearly visible in the quadrupole and hexadecapole at large scale.Fig. 7 shows the different systematics and corrections applied successively to the EZ mocks.

        <p>The model presented in Section 3 neglects the evolution of the cosmological background within the redshift range of the eBOSS ELG sample. To test the impact of this assumption on clustering measurements, we first fit 300 EZ periodic boxes at redshift z snap = 0.876 (see Section 6.2), using a Gaussian covariance matrix, as in Section 5.2. We compare these measurements to those obtained on the mean of the no veto EZ mocks, that is including the (approximate) light-cone and global (tiling) footprint. In this case, we apply the corresponding window function treatment (Section 3.4) and the GIC (Section 3.5) in the model. To ease the comparison, which we present in Table 3, we extrapolate the best fits to the EZ boxes at redshift z snap = 0.876 to the effective redshift z eff = 0.845 of the EZ mocks, using their input cosmology of equation ( 37). The difference between Table 3. Comparison of the RSD measurements on EZ boxes at redshift z snap = 0.876 and extrapolated at z eff = 0.845 (given their cosmology), with those from the sky-cut EZ mocks, with and without veto masks. For the EZ boxes, we quote the mean and standard deviation of the best-fitting measurements, divided by the square root of the number of realizations (300). For the sky-cut mocks, error bars are given by the χ 2 = 1 level on the mean of the mocks. the extrapolated mean of the best fits to the EZ boxes and the best fit to the mean of the EZ mocks is 0.2 per cent on fσ 8 , 0.4 per cent on D H (z)/r drag and 0.2 per cent on D M (z)/r drag , fully negligible compared to the dispersion of the mocks (12 per cent, 6 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively, see Table 5), validating our modelling approximation of the eBOSS ELG survey as a single snapshot at redshift z eff = 0.845. We finally apply veto masks to EZ mocks and in the window function calculation. In this case, again, the change in best-fitting parameters is 0.1 per cent, compatible with the error bars (baseline versus no veto). We also checked that increasing the sampling of the window function in the s → 0 limit has virtually no impact (0.01 per cent) on the cosmological measurement.

        <p>Fibre collisions are shown to be the dominant observational systematics in the eBOSS QSO sample (Hou et al. 2020;Neveux et al. 2020).

We report in Table 5 the best fits to 2003 GLAM-QPM baseline mocks with only geometry and veto masks applied (baseline) and to the mocks where fibre collisions are simulated (fibre collisions).

        <p>The impact of fibre collisions can be mitigated following Hahn et al. (2017), if the fraction of collided pairs f s and the fibre collision angular scale D fc are known. In the Hahn et al. ( 2017) correction, f s = 1 corresponds to all galaxy pairs closer than the fibre collision angular scale being unobserved. Because of tile overlaps, this fraction is reduced. The fraction of collided pairs f s can then be estimated in several ways: (i) Tile overlap: The fraction of the survey area without tile overlap, estimated using the synthetic catalogue.

        <p>All these estimates are calculated with veto masks applied and are reported in Table 4, using 50 mocks (for EZ and GLAM-QPM simulated collision fraction). They all agree within 2 per cent.

Fig. 8 displays the ratio of the projected correlation function of the GLAM-QPM mocks with fibre collisions corrected by w cp,i to the true one (without fibre collisions): f s , given by the height of the step function (see Hahn et al. 2017), is in very good agreement with the above estimates provided in Table 4.

        <p>As mentioned in Section 6.2, the shuffled scheme, used to assign data redshifts to randoms is responsible for a major shift of the power spectrum multipoles (purple versus red curves in Fig. 7). As discussed in de Mattia &amp; Ruhlmann-Kleider (2019), this damping of the power spectrum multipoles on large scales is not specific to the shuffled scheme, but to any method measuring the radial selection function on the observed data itself. We report in Table 5 the cosmological measurements from RSD fits without (baseline, GIC) and with the shuffled scheme (shuffled, GIC), while keeping the GIC in the model: the induced systematic shift is 0.4 per cent on fσ 8 (4 per cent of the dispersion of the mocks), 4.4 per cent on α (66 per cent), and 3.9 per cent on α ⊥ (78 per cent).

        <p>We propose to mitigate these residual systematics by rescaling weighted randoms in HEALPIX7 (Górski et al. 2005) pixels such that the density fluctuations F (r) of equation ( 4) are forced to 0 in each pixel (a scheme which will be referred to as the pixelated scheme in the following). This leads to an angular integral constraint (AIC), which we model and combine with the RIC following de Mattia &amp; Ruhlmann-Kleider (2019). In Table 5, we report the RSD measurements without (baseline, GIC) and with the full angular and radial integral constraints (ARIC) modelled, applying the shuffled and pixelated schemes to the uncontaminated mock data, for two pixel sizes: nside = 64 ( 0.84 deg 2 ) and nside = 128 ( 0.21 deg 2 ). The combined radial and angular integral constraint is correctly modelled, generating only a small potential bias of 1.1 per cent on fσ 8 , 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent on scaling parameters (which amounts to 10 per cent, 8 per cent, and 7 per cent of the dispersion of the mocks, respectively) for nside = 64.

Pre-reconstruction α measurements on both EZ and GLAM-QPM mocks are biased slightly high, as can be seen from Table 6 (baseline pre-reconstruction versus baseline). This is in line with the expected shift of the BAO peak caused by the non-linearity of structure formation (Padmanabhan, White &amp; Cohn 2009;Ding et al. 2018).

        <p>One would notice that the mean error on α measurements on EZ and GLAM-QPM mocks (defined by the χ 2 = 1 level, see Section 4.3) is systematically and significantly lower than the dispersion of the best-fitting values. The value of the damping parameter nl = 4 Mpc h -1 is chosen to match the BAO amplitude seen in the reconstructed OuterRim mocks (see Section 5.5). However, the BAO amplitude is significantly less pronounced in the EZ mocks (see e.g. Raichoor et al. 2020), hence favouring a larger nl = 6 Mpc h -1 . When this value is used, the distribution of the residuals (αα )/σ of mocks with BAO detection is consistent with a standard normal distribution, as shown by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test8 of Fig. 10. Using a lower nl artificially decreases the error on the BAO fits to EZ or GLAM-QPM mocks. Since we determined nl on the more accurate OuterRim-based mocks, we conclude that statistical errors quoted on the data measurement are fairly estimated.One would notice that the mean error on α measurements on EZ and GLAM-QPM mocks (defined by the χ 2 = 1 level, see Section 4.3) is systematically and significantly lower than the dispersion of the best-fitting values.

        <p>Again, RSD + BAO measurements on contaminated (all syst, fc) mocks are strongly biased: 9.2 per cent on fσ 8 (86 per cent of the dispersion of the mocks), 2.1 per cent on α (41 per cent), and 1.6 per cent on α ⊥ (42 per cent). When applying the pixelated scheme (nside = 64), one recovers reasonable systematic shifts with respect to (baseline, GIC) of 2.5 per cent on fσ 8 , 0.6 per cent on α , and 0.5 per cent on α ⊥ . These shifts reduce further when using nside = 128, but we choose the pixelated scheme with nside = 64 as it induces a bias which we estimate small enough for our analysis since it represents 24 per cent of the dispersion of the mocks on fσ 8 , 11 per cent on α , and 13 per cent on α ⊥ . In addition, the pixelated scheme (which involves integrating over all scales of the model correlation function) has only been tested up to nside = 64 with N-body based mocks in de Mattia &amp; Ruhlmann-Kleider (2019).

        <p>We finally test the robustness of our analysis when using a covariance matrix measured from the GLAM-QPM mocks (without angular photometric systematics), from EZ mocks without systematics (no syst. cov), and when shifting the k-bin centres by half a bin (0.005 h Mpc -1 , all syst. + 1/2 k-bin). In all these cases, best fits to the EZ mocks remain stable.We finally test the robustness of our analysis when using a covariance matrix measured from the GLAM-QPM mocks (without angular photometric systematics), from EZ mocks without systematics (no syst. cov), and when shifting the k-bin centres by half a bin (0.005 h Mpc -1 , all syst. + 1/2 k-bin).

        <p>As decided in Section 5.5, we take nl = 4 Mpc h -1 as fiducial value for the BAO damping and BAO templates are computed within the fiducial cosmology (10), except otherwise stated. Fig. 12 shows the BAO oscillation pattern fitted to the observed ELG NGC + SGC data. One would note that NGC does not show a clear BAO feature, contrary to SGC. The best-fitting α and its 1σ error are provided for both SGC and NGC + SGC fits in Table 7. For both fits, α ± σ lies well in [0.8, 1.2],9 the criterion used in Section 7.6 to qualify detections in the mocks. However, in the NGC alone, the best-fitting α value is 0.79, such that the aforementioned criterion is not met. The same test, using the same BAO template in fiducial cosmology (10), is applied to EZ mocks (with nl = 6 Mpc h -1 , to match their BAO signal amplitude) and to sky-cut OuterRim mocks of Section 5.5 (with nl = 2.4 Mpc h -1 , to match their BAO signal amplitude), as reported in Table 8 (α ± σ ∈ [0.8, 1.2] line). Sky-cut OuterRim mocks (hereafter OR mocks), based on N-body simulations, provide the expected BAO detections in the absence of non-Gaussian contributions due to systematics. 10 In contrast, EZ mocks include known data systematics, but their BAO amplitude is lower than expected given their cosmology. Altogether, we expect the correct BAO detection rate to lie between values derived from EZ mocks and OR mocks. One notices that 9 per cent of the EZ mocks and 2.5 per cent of the OR mocks fail to meet the α ± σ ∈ [0.8, 1.2] criterion in both the NGC and SGC. Therefore, the probability that α does not lie in [0.8,1.2] within errors, for either the NGC or the SGC, ranges from 5 per cent (OR mocks) to 17 per cent (EZ mocks), such that, with this criterion, the behaviour of the data is not very unexpected. This is in line with conclusions drawn in the configuration space BAO analysis (Raichoor et al. 2020).As decided in Section 5.5, we take nl = 4 Mpc h -1 as fiducial value for the BAO damping and BAO templates are computed within the fiducial cosmology (10), except otherwise stated.

        <p>To further quantify the BAO signal we compute the χ 2 difference between the best fits obtained with the wiggle and no-wiggle power spectrum templates (see Section 3.6). The χ 2 profiles using the wiggle and no-wiggle power spectrum templates are shown in Fig. 13. Combining NGC and SGC we find χ 2 = -1.95 (1.4σ ) at a bestfitting value denoted α NSGC in the following. Note however that the best-fitting α value may not be relevant to compute the χ 2 criterion when too far from the true one if the data (or mock) vector is too noisy.

We also provide the χ 2 taken at the expected α value, given our fiducial cosmology, α exp (α exp = 1 for data). We find that for NGC + SGC, the mean χ 2 (α = α NSGC ) is lower in the mocks, meaning a better BAO detection. However, 18 per cent EZ mocks and 7 per cent OR mocks have larger χ 2 values, i.e. worse BAO detection, than the data (see N(&gt; χ 2 (α = α NSGC )) line in Table 8). So according to this criterion, the behaviour of the data is not very unexpected. A similar conclusion holds when taking χ 2 at α = α exp (see N(&gt; 8).

        <p>We have seen that contrary to SGC the poor BAO detection in the NGC is statistically unlikely (even given the known observational systematics implemented in the EZ mocks). Let us now discuss whether one can combine the two caps. We note that NGC photometry is shallower than SGC and thus more prone to (potentially unknown) photometric systematics (Raichoor et al. 2020). SGC only and combined NGC + SGC fits are similar, to the 1.1 per cent level (0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 in Table 7), which is statistically expected, as seen in 755/1000 EZ mocks (considering both tails). Hence, there is no hint of a strong, unexpected systematic shift in the combined fit, due the addition of potentially contaminated NGC data. We also note that this 1.1 per cent shift is smaller than 1.3 per cent, the uncertainty related to photometric systematics included in our systematic budget (see Table 9), and hence is already accounted for if the NGC was the major source of photometric systematics. As a conclusion, we do not see any reason to reject NGC data in the fit. Moreover, combining NGC + SGC turns out to be more optimal than considering SGC alone, even given the poor BAO detection in NGC. To check this, we select EZ mocks with χ 2 (α = α NSGC ) &gt; 0 in the NGC but χ 2 (α = α NSGC ) &lt; 0 in the SGC among mocks for which the NGC + SGC combination fulfils α ± σ ∈ [0.8, 1.2]. The dispersion of α measurements in the obtained sample of 130 mocks is 0.048 for NGC + SGC, less than 0.058 for SGC alone. In addition, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (similar to that of Fig. 10) does not show any misestimation of error bars (p-value of 0.533 for the residuals to be consistent with a standard normal distribution). A similar reduction of error bars is seen in data in Table 7 ( +0.025 -0.028 versus +0.032 -0.035 ). Hence, we find it legitimate to combine NGC and SGC measurements.We have seen that contrary to SGC the poor BAO detection in the NGC is statistically unlikely (even given the known observational systematics implemented in the EZ mocks).

        <p>To further check that error bars are still correctly estimated in the low signal-to-noise regime, we select NGC + SGC EZ mocks for which χ 2 (α = α NSGC ) is larger than that observed in the data (while still restricting to α ± σ ∈ [0.8, 1.2]). Again, in this sample of 165 EZ mocks, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows no hint for a misestimation of error bars (the p-value for the residuals to be consistent with a standard normal distribution is 0.459). Therefore, the method to estimate statistical uncertainties in data appears to be correct. We note however that data statistical error bars ( +0.025 -0.028 , see Table 7) are smaller than those seen in mocks on average (σ 0.033, see Table 6); 246/1000 EZ mocks have smaller statistical error bars than data (using nl = 4 Mpc h -1 for both data and mocks). In a sample of EZ mocks for which χ 2 (α = α NSGC ) is within ±1 of the data χ 2 (α = α NSGC ), which may be considered as representative of the data affinity for BAO, we find 6/157 mocks to have smaller statistical error bars than the data.11 Due to the low average BAO amplitude in the EZ mocks and the additional residual systematics in the data, this fraction slightly underestimates the probability to obtain smaller error bars than in data. Altogether, though small, data statistical error bars are not too unlikely.To further check that error bars are still correctly estimated in the low signal-to-noise regime, we select NGC + SGC EZ mocks for which χ 2 (α = α NSGC ) is larger than that observed in the data (while still restricting to α ± σ ∈ [0.8, 1.2]).

        <p>We now turn to stability tests performed on data. Beforehand, we emphasize that despite the low significance of the BAO signal, a robust measurement of the BAO position is possible because the relative amplitude of oscillations is imposed as a prior in the BAO model (Section 3.6). In other words, though a model without BAO is not disfavoured by the data, a model with BAO far from the maximum of the likelihood is a significantly worse fit to the data.We now turn to stability tests performed on data.

        <p>In Raichoor et al. (2020, fig. 10), variations of the redshift density with photometric depth were noted to be relatively higher in the low-redshift end, 0.6 &lt; z 0.7. We therefore test the robustness of our measurement with the lower z-limit. Best fits do not move significantly with the lower z cut (given the change in the sample statistics), as can also be seen in Fig. 13. For example, between 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 and 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 the best-fitting α moves by 0.4 per cent. This is not significant as a larger shifts happen in 378/1000 (considering both tails: 741/1000) EZ mocks. We thus use the full redshift range 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 for our isotropic BAO measurement.In Raichoor et al.

        <p>The α measurement remains very stable with the assumed nl value in SGC only. For NGC + SGC, some 0.8 per cent shift (27 per cent of the statistical uncertainty) is obtained between nl = 4 Mpc h -1 and nl = 6 Mpc h -1 . A larger shift happens for 97/1000 (considering both tails: 214/1000) EZ mocks. To account for the uncertainty in the expected amplitude of the BAO signal, we include this shift as an additional uncertainty.The α measurement remains very stable with the assumed nl value in SGC only.

        <p>We estimate the potential residual systematics due to the imperfect modelling of the variations of the survey selection function with imaging quality (see Section 6.1) by comparing the measurement obtained with the baseline correction to that without any mitigation. Namely, random redshifts are taken separately in each chunk (instead of chunk z) to measure the data power spectrum. The covariance matrix is built from mocks where we do not introduce photometric systematics nor variations of the redshift density with chunk z. We take care to change the model window functions (see Section 3) accordingly. A shift in α of 1.3 per cent, which we take as systematic uncertainty, is noticed between these two configurations. One would notice that a variation of 0.6 per cent is seen in the SGC alone. Hence, the shift of the NGC + SGC best fit appears to be mainly driven by the NGC, as can be expected since photometry is shallower in the NGC than in the SGC.We estimate the potential residual systematics due to the imperfect modelling of the variations of the survey selection function with imaging quality (see Section 6.1) by comparing the measurement obtained with the baseline correction to that without any mitigation.

        <p>The residual systematics remaining after the redshift failure correction (see Section 6.1) are similarly estimated by comparing the measurement obtained with the baseline correction to that without any mitigation (no w noz,i ). Namely, no w noz,i are applied to measure the data power spectrum, while we do not introduce redshift failures in the mocks to construct the covariance matrix. This leads to a shift in α of 0.2 per cent; a larger variation is seen in 438/1000 (considering both tails: 851/1000) EZ mocks, making it quite likely. Note however that data and EZ mock shifts are expected to match since a mock object is deterministically declared a redshift failure if the redshift of its nearest neighbour in the data could not be reliably measured. As mentioned in Section 7.8, a second set of mocks was produced with redshift failures being randomly drawn from the model fitted to the data; in this case, we find a larger variation in 378/1000 (considering both tails: 826/1000) EZ mocks. Hence, the shift seen in the data is well explained by the mocks. We conservatively include it in the systematic budget to account for the uncertainty in the redshift failure correction.The residual systematics remaining after the redshift failure correction (see Section 6.1) are similarly estimated by comparing the measurement obtained with the baseline correction to that without any mitigation (no w noz,i ).

        <p>Changing the covariance matrix for that based on GLAM-QPM mocks, which does not include angular nor radial photometric systematics leads to a small α shift of 0.4 per cent in the no chunk z case (no chunk z G-Q cov versus no chunk z). Similarly, in the baseline case, using a covariance matrix built from GLAM-QPM or EZ mocks without systematics (only the shuffled scheme) induces small shifts of 0.2 per cent (GLAM-QPM cov versus baseline). A larger shift is observed in the former case for 283/1000 (considering both tails: 732/1000) EZ mocks, in the latter case for 377/1000 (considering both tails: 713/1000) EZ mocks. The parameter covariance matrix correction equation (A22) already leads to an increase of 0.7 per cent of the statistical error, which is higher than obtained by summing the shifts above in quadrature (0.3 per cent). We therefore do not include any systematic uncertainty related to the choice of the covariance matrix. Dividing the number of mocks used to build the covariance matrix by 2, we find a shift in α of 0.5 per cent (500 mocks in cov versus baseline). This would lead to a 1.9 per cent increase of the error if added in quadrature, while the increase of error bars required to account for the change in covariance matrix between these two configurations is 1.5 per cent. Hence, the shift seen in the fit is compatible with a statistical fluctuation and we conclude that the estimation of the covariance matrix is robust enough for this measurement.Changing the covariance matrix for that based on GLAM-QPM mocks, which does not include angular nor radial photometric systematics leads to a small α shift of 0.4 per cent in the no chunk z case (no chunk z G-Q cov versus no chunk z). Similarly, in the baseline case, using a covariance matrix built from GLAM-QPM or EZ mocks without systematics (only the shuffled scheme) induces small shifts of 0.2 per cent (GLAM-QPM cov versus baseline). A larger shift is observed in the former case for 283/1000 (considering both tails: 732/1000) EZ mocks, in the latter case for 377/1000 (considering both tails: 713/1000) EZ mocks. The parameter covariance matrix correction equation (A22) already leads to an increase of 0.7 per cent of the statistical error, which is higher than obtained by summing the shifts above in quadrature (0.3 per cent). We therefore do not include any systematic uncertainty related to the choice of the covariance matrix. Dividing the number of mocks used to build the covariance matrix by 2, we find a shift in α of 0.5 per cent (500 mocks in cov versus baseline). This would lead to a 1.9 per cent increase of the error if added in quadrature, while the increase of error bars required to account for the change in covariance matrix between these two configurations is 1.5 per cent. Hence, the shift seen in the fit is compatible with a statistical fluctuation and we conclude that the estimation of the covariance matrix is robust enough for this measurement.</p>

Indeed, we checked that analysing a power spectrum in our fiducial cosmology with an OuterRim template leads to a preferred nl 5.4 Mpc h -1 . The measurement obtained with nl = 6 Mpc h -1 and OuterRim cosmology (OR cosmo nl = 6 Mpc h -1 ) is indeed close (within 0.2 per cent) to the measurement using nl = 4 Mpc h -1 and our fiducial cosmology [0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 (fiducial)].

        <p>Overall, despite the mild preference for BAO in the eBOSS ELG sample, the BAO measurement appears relatively robust. The final error budget is reported in Table 9. Since the 0.1 per cent α shift attributed to model non-linearity is closer to a bias than a systematic uncertainty, we decided to be conservative and to add it linearly to the statistical uncertainty. All other contributions to the systematic budget are uncertainties due to the model accuracy (modelling systematics) or our limited knowledge of the survey selection function (photometric systematics, fibre collisions, redshift failures) or are analysis choices (damping term). We thus add them in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty.Overall, despite the mild preference for BAO in the eBOSS ELG sample, the BAO measurement appears relatively robust.

The good agreement between configuration and Fourier space measurements is shown by the data cross in Fig. 16, lying close to the diagonal.

        <p>First, the fine-grained veto masks applied to the eBOSS ELG data led us to revise the way window functions are normalized in the model. We also noticed that measuring the expected redshift distribution from observed data itself (using the shuffled scheme) led to a significant bias of cosmological parameters, which we corrected by modelling the induced RIC as in de Mattia &amp; Ruhlmann-Kleider (2019). Fibre collisions have been found to have a moderate impact, which we modelled following Hahn et al. (2017). Finally, residual angular systematics due to the inhomogeneous photometry, which could not be treated following the standard technique of template regression, were mitigated using the pixelated scheme as discussed in de Mattia &amp; Ruhlmann-Kleider (2019). For this study, to test our analysis pipeline, we implemented the survey geometry and realistic systematics into mock catalogues: depth-dependent radial selection function, angular photometric systematics, fibre collisions and redshift failures. We proved on mocks that our analysis is robust to these systematics when including all the corrections mentioned above. We derived residual systematic uncertainties from both our mock studies and robustness tests run on data.First, the fine-grained veto masks applied to the eBOSS ELG data led us to revise the way window functions are normalized in the model.

        <p>In this section, we justify the corrections applied to the parameter covariance for our combined NGC and SGC cosmological fit. Formula equation ( 28) is (formally) incorrect when combining two independent Gaussian likelihoods (e.g. NGC and SGC). Indeed, an intuitive use of equation ( 28) would take n b as the number of bins in either NGC or SGC and n p the total number of parameters. Then, however, the constraint n p ≤ n b inherent to this formula appears artificial. Indeed, there is no issue with having n p &gt; n b as long as n p is less than the total number of bins. Another approach would be to take n b as the total number of bins in NGC and SGC; though this would be correct if we estimated the combined NGC and SGC covariance from mocks, this does not apply to our case where we impose the cross-covariance between NGC and SGC to be zero. Therefore, we have to revise equation (28) in the context of a blockdiagonal covariance matrix.In this section, we justify the corrections applied to the parameter covariance for our combined NGC and SGC cosmological fit.

        <p>Some concern may be raised about a possible coupling between the data power spectrum measurements and the covariance matrix built from the 1000 EZ mocks. Indeed, angular systematics were implemented in these mocks based on a map of the observed ELG density (smoothed by a Gaussian beam of radius 1 deg). By construction, this systematic map includes data clustering angular modes which diffuse in the clustering of the contaminated EZ mocks. To check the importance of this effect, we generate a new systematic map based on the angular target density measured on one contaminated EZ reference mock, and contaminate the other 999 EZ mocks with this new map. Best fits to the reference mock using the original covariance matrix and using the new one are compared.Some concern may be raised about a possible coupling between the data power spectrum measurements and the covariance matrix built from the 1000 EZ mocks.

        <p>Performing RSD fits to the SGC, we find small shifts of 3.5 per cent for fσ 8 , 0.2 per cent for α and 0.3 per cent for α ⊥ , which are not significant since larger shifts are seen in 116/999, 471/999, and 440/999 EZ mocks (considering both tails: 219/999, 901/999, and 783/999).Performing RSD fits to the SGC, we find small shifts of 3.5 per cent for fσ 8 , 0.2 per cent for α and 0.3 per cent for α ⊥ , which are not significant since larger shifts are seen in 116/999, 471/999, and 440/999 EZ mocks (considering both tails: 219/999, 901/999, and 783/999).</p>
        <p>Redshift failures are also implemented in the mocks based on the observed data. We check the potential bias due to this tuning following the same procedure as for photometric systematics. With both photometric systematics and redshift failures coming from one mock, we find small shifts in SGC RSD fits of 1.9 per cent for fσ 8 , 1.2 per cent for α , and 0.3 per cent for α ⊥ , which are again not significant since larger shifts are seen in 279/999, 257/999, and 418/999 EZ mocks (considering both tails: 498/999, 463/999, and 783/999). We therefore see no evidence for a systematic bias due to coupling between data measurements and the covariance matrix built from contaminated EZ mocks.Redshift failures are also implemented in the mocks based on the observed data.
