        <p>During operation in challenging, extreme or harsh environments, such as those encountered in high or low temperature, nuclear, offshore, space, and deep mining environments, the robustness and stability of materials and devices are extremely important. Over recent decades, significant effort has been invested into improving the robustness and stability of materials through either structural design, the introduction of new chemistry, or improved manufacturing processes. Inspired by natural systems, the creation of self-healing materials has the potential to overcome these challenges and provide a route to achieve dynamic repair during service.During operation in challenging, extreme or harsh environments, such as those encountered in high or low temperature, nuclear, offshore, space, and deep mining environments, the robustness and stability of materials and devices are extremely important.

        <p>For intrinsically self-healing materials, reversible Diels-Alder (DA) cycloadditions are a commonly employed mechanism due to their inherent simplicity, reversibility and repeatability. [16] Reactions between furan and maleimide, [17] or anthracene and maleimide, [18] have been used for self-healing, where the thermal reversibility of the reaction imposes limitations on its application areas. The retro-DA reaction of furan-maleimide adducts occurs at approximately 120 o C, and therefore above this temperature the mechanical properties of these materials decline due to a reduction in the number of crosslinks. Anthracene-maleimide adducts are cleaved at higher temperatures, up to 250 o C, which is often beyond the decomposition temperature of the polymers. [19] This has been overcome by using anthracene and maleimide moieties to achieve high temperature self-healing in carbon fibre reinforced polymers composites (CFRP) at 250~300 o C. [16] As shown in Figure 4(Aa), 9-anthracenemethanol and N-(2-hydroxethyl)-maleimide were cross-linked prior to their reaction with hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) to synthesise a viscous liquid premonomer (HDTA), which eliminated the the need for a need for solvent needss or melting requirements forin theto processing of bulk specimens. PThe polyurethanes with a higher molar ratio of HDTA/HDI exhibited improved self-healing properties, as healing requires crack propagation to formoccur predominantlyimarily through the Diels-Alder bonds.For intrinsically self-healing materials, reversible Diels-Alder (DA) cycloadditions are a commonly employed mechanism due to their inherent simplicity, reversibility and repeatability.

        <p>Materials, structures and devices often need to operate in extreme or harsh environments, in applications such as nuclear, offshore, industrial plants, space, and deep mining. Extreme conditions typically refers to temperatures outside the range -40 to 125 °C, low or high pressure (such as a vacuum or 200 bar, respectively), intense levels of radiation, shock and vibration, high electric or magentic fields, saturated salt concentrations, highly acidic or alkaline environments (pH ~ &lt;2 or &gt;11), and corrosive environments. [1] The materials, components and devices that operate in such conditions need to be sufficiently robust and durable in order to maintain their performance and sustain the harsh working conditions. Furthermore, for challenging areas that are difficult to reach, such as oil fields, the deep ocean, or remote locations, it is desirable for materials to be self-sensing, adaptive, self-healing and perform autonomously, which can prevent people from working in potentially harmful operations, whilst saving energy and reducing operational costs.Materials, structures and devices often need to operate in extreme or harsh environments, in applications such as nuclear, offshore, industrial plants, space, and deep mining.

        <p>Most polymers are electrically or thermally insulating, and thermally stable in a temperature range of -80 and 300 o C. These characteristics allow polymers to sustain chemical, mechanical, thermal, electrical, or radiation exposure to some extent. Beyond these normal conditions, a new environment that pushes the capabilities of these materials to their limits can be considered as a harsh environment, which raises new challenges for developing high performance polymers and devices, including the introduction of self-healing. Self-healing polymers refer to materials that are able to recover their structure and properties partially or fully after damage. Therefore, the ability to self-heal provides these materials with the potential for improved reliability, stability and durability. An example of a challenging environment is the sealing or adhesive materials used for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, which are exposed to acidic liquid solutions, high humidity (up to 100% relative humidity), hydrogen gas, coolants (e.g. synthetic hydrocarbons, perfluorocarbons, fluorosilicone fluids), large temperature cycles (between -40 and 100 o C), electrochemical environments and mechanical stresses. During operation, any gas or fluid leakage between the components due to the degradation of the seals and adhesives can damage the fuel cells and lead to safety concerns; however, there are many other examples. Figure 1 provides a snapshot of the types of difficulties experienced by materials within a variety of extreme environments. The aim of this review is to overview the current technologies that exploit self-healing materials and devices to operate in such conditions, and their current limitations and directions for future development.Most polymers are electrically or thermally insulating, and thermally stable in a temperature range of -80 and 300 o C.

        <p>Self-healing materials are classified into two categories: extrinsic and intrinsic self-healing.Self-healing materials are classified into two categories: extrinsic and intrinsic self-healing.</p>
        <p>The extrinsic self-healing process relies on the introduction of pre-embedded healing agents, often carried in microcapsules or microvascular fibres, which act to release the healing agents upon rupture and react to bind damaged surfaces. Microcapsules are limited to the infilling of microscopic cracks and the healing process only takes place in locations where fractured capsules are present. Microvascular materials are able deliver more healing fluid than capsules, due to the supply of healing agents by a microvascular network that allows repair of repeated damage and restoration of larger volumes. The strategies used to achieve extrinsic healing are summarised in Figure 2, which shows the range of capsule-assisted and microvascular assisted approaches; the mechanisms have been discussed in detail in recent excellent reviews. [2], [3] However, extrinsic approaches are irreversible, and the embedding of microcapsules or microvascular materials raise further technical challenges for balancing processing, interfaces, mechanical and other functional properties of the composites.The extrinsic self-healing process relies on the introduction of pre-embedded healing agents, often carried in microcapsules or microvascular fibres, which act to release the healing agents upon rupture and react to bind damaged surfaces.

        <p>In contrast, intrinsic self-healing processes are performed through the use of reversible dynamic covalent bonds or supramolecular interactions within the polymer structure, which have the capacity to interact and reform the microstructures under specific conditions, so that they perform multiple healing cycles autonomously. [5] As shown in Figure 3Aa, intrinsic selfhealing of polymers can be achieved by dynamic covalent bonds via associative or dissociative exchange reactions, [6] such as disulfide metathesis, imine transamination, radical-based exchange systems, or reversible Diels-Alder reactions. Supramolecular interactions include hydrogen or halogen bonds, ionic interactions, π-interactions, host-guest interactions, metalligand interactions and hydrophobic interactions. [7] In addition, through surface functionalisation of nanoparticles, exchangeable reactions can also occur at the interfaces of nanoparticles and polymer matrices to assist in self-healing at interfaces. The detailed introduction of the dynamic reactions for covalent polymer networks for self-healing and reprocessable polymers can be found from recent detailed reviews, [5,8,9] along with the latest applications of self-healing polymers in smart devices. [10,11] The ability of a polymer to intrinsically self-heal depends on its chain mobility and the exchange kinetics of its dynamic bonds. When the two new surfaces make contact with each other, dynamic bonds exchange and the mobility of the polymer chains allows for structural reformation to recover properties. However, to heal damage such as a mechanical crack, there is generally a need for an intimate contact between the separated surfaces to allow the polymer chains to interact, diffuse or react. The introduction of shape-memory properties by tuning the phase morphology or crystalline domains can allow shape recovery and enable fractured surfaces to re-connect with each other, thereby assisting in the healing process. [12] The efficiency of the self-healing process depends on the nature of the reversible bonds and the healing conditions, which can be enhanced by a combination of multiple healing mechanisms, such as shape-memory assisted self-healing (Figure 3Bb), soft-hard microphase separation (Figure 3Cc) or using nanocomposites (Figure 3Dd). Now that the range of healing mechanisms have been introduced, the range of potential hostile environments that self-healing may be needed is described.In contrast, intrinsic self-healing processes are performed through the use of reversible dynamic covalent bonds or supramolecular interactions within the polymer structure, which have the capacity to interact and reform the microstructures under specific conditions, so that they perform multiple healing cycles autonomously.

        <p>Recently, a series of thermostable self-healing linear polyurethane elastomers have been reported, which use retro-Diels-Alder reactions initiated by thermal and mechanical stimuli between anthryl and maleimide groups. [20] The polyurethanes bore pendant anthryl groups which covalently cross-linked with bismaleimide cross-linkers, as shown in Figure 4(c). To evaluate the healing process, the cross-linked specimens were cut and kept at 90 o C. The polyurethane chains and hydrogen bonds rearranged aswith the expansion of the crack surfaces expanded during heating and the heat treatment led to the recombination of the Diels-Alder bonds, which reformedgenerated the structure of the network structure structure and regeneratedstored its mechanical properties. The healing efficiency reached a maximum of 91% with respect to ultimate tensile strength for the polyurethane with a 1:1 ratio of anthryl to maleimide functional groups, respectively. With regards to the thermal stability, decomposition was observed above 250 o C, which was ascribed to the decomposition of the urethane bonds.Recently, a series of thermostable self-healing linear polyurethane elastomers have been reported, which use retro-Diels-Alder reactions initiated by thermal and mechanical stimuli between anthryl and maleimide groups.

        <p>A photopolymerization-based additive manufacturing technique to form self-healable elastomer structures with free-form architectures has been developed. [28] The process depends on a molecularly designed photo-elastomer ink with both thiol and disulfide groups. The thiol groups facilitate thiol-ene photopolymerization reactions during the additive manufacturing process and the disulfide groups enable disulfide metathesis reactions during the self-healing process. 3D soft actuators were manufactured using rapid additive manufacturing of singleand multi-material self-healable structures, as shown in Figure 78.

The results show the photo-elastomer can be an effective solution for fabricating self-healing free-form architectures.</p>

        <p>In addition to developing polymer matrices with intrinsic self-healing properties, extrinsic approaches are also used to achieve high temperature healing. For example, a trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), a strong Brønsted acid, was encapsulated in silica microspheres and mixed with an epoxy monomer to form a self-healing agent. [29] The selfhealing epoxy that contains both epoxy-and TfOH-loaded capsules did not undergo decomposition at temperatures below 300 °C, although for the TfOH-loaded capsules a weight change was observed due to the volatilization of TfOH. The matrix epoxy obstructed the escape channels of the volatile TfOH and the composite was therefore able to withstand high temperature exposure. Cationic chain polymerization formed the basis of the curing mechanism of the epoxy when catalysed by the strong Brønsted acid. A self-healing system based on a 10 wt% epoxy loaded-microcapsules and 0.6 wt% TfOH loaded-microcapsules exhibited a maximum healing efficiency of 79% after 100 seconds with respect to impact strength. This level of healing efficiency was possible even after 10 months of open-air storage, indicating there was no surface ageing, and that TfOH did not exert a noticeable negative impact on the healed epoxy. Therefore, the healing system was stable for long-term storage at room temperature and also thermally stable within a high temperature environment. However, since the microcapsules can only release a limited amount of healing agent, the system is best suited for the elimination of only small scale micro-cracks. It was noted that the balance between the rate of curing and the speed of healing agent delivery would require further consideration for larger scale damage sites; there is potential to examine the use of a microvascular network (Figure 3B) using this healing chemistry.In addition to developing polymer matrices with intrinsic self-healing properties, extrinsic approaches are also used to achieve high temperature healing.

        <p>Polymer chain mobility is important to the self-healing process and enabling the recovery of properties after damage. At temperatures below the glass transition temperature, 𝑇 𝑔 , of a polymer, the chains have restricted mobility, thereby making it more challenging for polymers to self-heal. For example, the trans-Siberian railway, reaching from Moscow to Vladivostok (over 9000 km), frequently experiences temperatures lower than -20 °C and in aerospace applications, aircraft parts can be exposed to temperatures as low as -60 °C. [30] It is also critical that self-healing materials can function in extreme environments with temperature fluctuations between -150 and 150 °C. This has led to high demands on the performance of self-healing material, which require (i) chemical stability and high thermal stability of the self-healing components (catalysts and vessels filled with healing agents) and (ii) high healing efficiencies at low temperature. [31] Extrinsic healing methods are often applied for low-temperature self-healing, via the use of microcapsules, hollow vessels and conductive heating elements. [2,32] Alternatively, lowtemperature intrinsic self-healing methods have included hydrogen bonding, azide/alkyne click reactions and metal-ligand interactions. [33][34][35] This section will discuss the progress made in these areas coupled with their apparent limitations.Polymer chain mobility is important to the self-healing process and enabling the recovery of properties after damage.

        <p>Extrinsically self-healing materials often employ liquid resins or solvents that are microencapsulated within the matrix. The curable resin is released into the damaged area and subsequent polymerization of the resin is triggered by an embedded catalyst, thereby healing the damaged area. [36] This method has been adapted to produce materials that can arecan selfhealable in at low-temperature environments. For instance, microencapsulated diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A and diglycidyl tetrahydro-o-phthalate epoxy resins, with mercaptan as a hardener, were used as a two-component healing agent embedded in an epoxy matrix, with benzyl dimethylamine as the healing catalyst. [37] The microcapsules were able to interface with the matrix via hydrogen bonding through polar amine and hydroxyl groups on their melamineformaldehyde shells. This interaction promoted crack penetrationthe penetration of cracks through the encapsulated healing agent during mechanical damage. In terms of recovery of fracture toughness, the healing efficiencies was greater than 82% at 20 o C after 3 hours and over 100% after 12 hours. The self-healing process slowed down with decreasing temperature, but continued to exhibit an 86% recovery at -10 o C after 36 hours. These indicated that high Formatted: Font color: Dark Red Formatted: Font color: Dark Red healing efficienciesy are can obtainablebe acquired at low capsule contents (2.5 wt% epoxyloaded capsules and 2.5 wt% hardener-loaded capsules).

However, it was observed that the temperature of -10 o C is the lower limit, which is not sufficiently low for colder applications, such as aerospace. It should be noted that the self-healing performance of the system was evaluated at room temperature, which can enhance fluid transport throughout the damaged region, yielding artificially high values of healing efficiency. Another similar example is the study of the polymerization of a 5-ethlidene-2-norbornene/dicyclopentadiene healing agent at -50 o C for aerospace applications, [38] where a healing efficiency of 72% was reported.

        <p>The low-temperature self-healing behaviour of a microcapsule-type protective coating has also been demonstrated.

[32] The design involved embedding the two components into a glass fibre-reinforced laminate composite with vessels to deliver and release the healing agents, with a thin conductive layer to supply heat by Joule heating and provide a suitable temperature for healing; this is shown Figure 89. The conductive layer was fabricated from either a porous copper foam sheet or porous carbon nanotube sheet. For the system containing carbon nanotube sheets, an applied voltage between 10 and 16 V achieved a steady-state temperature in the range of 20 to 85 o C, which de-iced the composite in 90 s and enabled curing within 24 hours to achieve healing. After 24 hours of healing at -60 o C, the composite with carbon nanotube sheets exhibited average healing efficiencies of approximately 107% and 96% with respect to fracture energy and peak load respectively. An Only a small electrical current of only 200 mA was required to generate the heat, reducing the probability of severe thermal hotspots that could lead to damage. This vessel-based design was advantageous compared to capsule-based designs as healing agents could be continuously pumped into the vessels and the vessel network had only a minor effect on the tensile strength. This provides a novel solution to solve the problem of effective low-temperature self-healing for applications such as in-flight aircraft and satellites, as well as offshore appliances such as wind turbines.

        <p>An intrinsically self-healing matrix that utilizes associative or dissociative chemical bonds has the ability to break and reform when damage occurs; the chemical bonds can include reversible dynamic covalent bonds or non-covalent interactions. The combination of different dynamic bonds provides opportunities to expand the self-healing thermodynamics and kinetics by the selection of the dynamic bonds. For example, Kalista et al. took advantage of hydrogen bonding and ionic association interactions to produce a specific class of poly(ethylene-comethacrylic acid) (EMAA) copolymers and ionomers with the ability to autonomously selfheal ballistic projectile punctures at low-temperature within a wide operational temperature range. [39] A range of EMAA copolymers varying from non-ionic to highly neutralized were studied to explore the relationship between ionic content, morphology and the self-healing response to ballistic impact. The mobility and strength of the associated regions of the nonneutralized non-ionic copolymers and of the ionomers with partially neutralized methacrylic acid groups arose from the introduction of hydrogen bonding and ionic association interactions respectively. During ballistic puncture testing, the energy was transferred to the punctured film and could be stored elastically to facilitate closure of the hole; energy can also be lost via neutralization were highly ionic and this led to a decrease in the self-healing ability since an increase of ionic domains led to a more densely packed system, thereby leading to a decrease in chain mobility. A moderate ionic content improved the self-healing properties by providing both strength and chain mobility at low temperatures. This work both demonstrated healing over a wide temperature range with a low-temperature limit and rapid healing. This makes the material attractive for use applications such as combat aircraft fuel tanks or as a resilient protective barrier of protection in oil tankers or other containment applications.An intrinsically self-healing matrix that utilizes associative or dissociative chemical bonds has the ability to break and reform when damage occurs; the chemical bonds can include reversible dynamic covalent bonds or non-covalent interactions.

        <p>Similarly, Yang et al. designed a conductive organo-hydrogel with antifreeze self-healing ability through the use of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.

        <p>Hydrogen bonding, coupled with ionic or electrostatic interactions, have proven to be effective for extreme low temperature healing. In addition, metal-ligand interactions are also effective in low-temperature self-healing materials. For example, a network of poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer chains cross-linked by three different interactions: a strong pyridyl-iron interaction, and two weaker carboxamido-iron interactions through both the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the carboxamide groups. [34] The iron-ligand bonds readily easily break and re-form, whilst the iron centres remain boundattached to the ligands through the stronger interactions with the pyridyl ring, enabling reversible unfolding and unrefolding of the chains, as shown in Figure 9AB10. This enabled the material to heal at temperatures as low as -20 o C with a healing efficiency of 68% for the fracture strain after a period 72 hours where the two severed pieces were in close contact. The maximum fracture strain reached up to 4500% due to the metalligand intrachain and interchain interactions. In addition, surface ageing and moisture did not significantly affect the material, as is often seen with hydrogen bonding. [40] These features, coupled with the fact that the material has a high dielectric constant (r ~ 6.4) and dielectric strength (18.8 MV m -1 ), make it extremely suitable for application towards self-healing artificial muscle actuators.

        <p>Safety is a major concern for structurally integrated systems such as aircraft, jet engines and power plants. During operation, complex structures experience a variety of forms of alternating stresses, or are subjected to demanding environments where time dependent degradation processes occur, such as creep and fatigue. When a material or structure is subjected to loading/unloading cycles, the fatigue process can initiate progressive and localised structural damage, such as crazes, microcracks or delamination. The damage can continuously grow until defects reach a critical size that ultimately leads to final fracture.Safety is a major concern for structurally integrated systems such as aircraft, jet engines and power plants.

        <p>Structural polymeric composites are subjected to fatigue loading in their service lifetime. One example is the adhesive failure at the interfaces of different components of composites, whereby the adhesive loses its adhesion to one of the bonding surfaces as a result of the hydration of the chemical bonds which form the connection between the adhesive and the bonding surface [43] , as shown in Figure 101Aa. This can be mitigated with surface preparation techniques, while adhesive debonding can be difficult to detect using non-destructive techniques. A different mode of failure, cohesive failure, can also be taken into consideration.Structural polymeric composites are subjected to fatigue loading in their service lifetime.

        <p>Cohesive failure is the breakdown of intermolecular bonding forces, occurring primarily in the bulk layer of an adhesive substance, [43] see Figure 101Bb, or combined adhesion and cohesion failure (Figure 101Cc). Other crack growth mechanisms include matrix cracking and fiber/matrix debonding which mainly affect fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites, as seen in Figure 101Dd. FRP laminated composites frequently undergo delamination as a failure mode, resulting from cyclic fatigue loading or low velocity impact events. [44] In order to mitigate the aforementioned events of polymeric structural materials, researchers have sought to incorporate self-healing mechanisms as a means to retard crack growth and extend the service lives of the materials. This section will discuss the progress made in this area coupled with their apparent limitations. Microcapsules act as an extrinsic means to introduce self-healing functionalities into polymeric materials to prevent and heal fatigue damage. White et al. pioneered this method of healing in 2001 with the first structural polymeric material capable of healing autonomously, utilizing a living ring-opening metathesis polymerization and invoking the use of a transition metal catalyst (Grubbs' catalyst). [36] In self-healing elastomers, the propagation of fatigue cracks due to fatigue loading is retarded by a range of mechanisms, such as hydrodynamic crack tip shielding, adhesive bonding and artificial crack closure. [45] An additional mechanism for torsional fatigue relates to theis based on frictional contact between crack faces, that are induced and accentuated by the healed polymer delivered uponto the crack plane. Following this principle, Keller et al. synthesized a self-healing material which consisted of a microencapsulated vinyl-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) resin containing platinum catalyst and a microencapsulated initiator (methylhydrosiloxane). [46] There was Sprofoundsignificant surface abrasions were present on the crack faces of the specimens containing the active healing chemistry, which. These abrasions and were associated with an operative sliding-crack-closure mechanism., Thiswhich reduced the effective stress at the crack front and led to a noticeable observed reductions of the terminal crack length in the torsion fatigue specimens. A second mechanism was proposed where the healing agent polymerizes and interacts with surface asperities on the crack faces to escalatefacilitateintensify the closure mechanism, thereby producing sharp increases in torsional stiffness. The generation of new polymers with the aforementioned shielding mechanisms reduced the apparent crack tip loading to slow crack propagation and the authors reported a 24% reduction in total fatigue crack growth after 5 hours of curing. [46] Furthermore, self-healing epoxies undergo similar shielding mechanisms. Epoxy resins strongly adhere to most inorganic surfaces typically due to strong polar attractions to oxide or hydroxyl surfaces. An extrinsically self-healing epoxy adhesive was reported for bonding steel substrates, using encapsulated dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) monomer and Grubbs' catalyst particles dispersed in a thin epoxy matrix. [47] The steel bonding surfaces was subject to mechanical abrasion, cleaning, and the application of a silane agent coupling was applied to promote cohesive failure through the self-healing adhesive. The incorporation of incorporation of microcapsules and catalyst particles into the adhesive corporation promoted crack path deflection from the substrate/adhesive interface into the adhesive layer for the self-healing. With these additions, the virgin fracture toughness increased by 26%, and self-healing specimens recovered 56% of their virgin fracture toughness after 24 hours of healing at room temperature. Furthermore, the self-healing samples exhibited complete crack arrest after 150,000 cycles, compared to that of the pure resin that failed at less than 62,000 cycles. This work demonstrates an increase in the lifetime of the material using self-healing to mitigate against progressive fatigue damage.Cohesive failure is the breakdown of intermolecular bonding forces, occurring primarily in the bulk layer of an adhesive substance, [43] see Figure 101Bb, or combined adhesion and cohesion failure (Figure 101Cc).

The final approach demonstrated a 75% extension of the fatigue life of the modified CFRP, as the healing cycle after each interruption slightly recovered the modulus of the fatigued sample and delayed the damage progression of damage in of the composite structure. The composite withstood 56,000 cycles using the interrupted healing cycles without deterioration of the in-plane mechanical properties of the composite. This provides an example of the utility of intrinsic methods to retard fatigue damage.

        <p>In environmental bodies of water, the pH of the water varies due to natural and manufactured factors. Acidic water is ubiquitous due to natural acidification, industrialization and mines among other things.

        <p>To circumvent these challenges, Xia et al. synthesised a hyperbranched polymer with multiple hydrophilic and hydrophobic terminal groups which possessed the ability to self-heal under water, more favourably in a low-pH environment. [50] The lipophilic polymer was made of hyperbranched polyurethane (HBPU), mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) and acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS). The hydrogen bonds between MSA units and the hydrophobic entanglement between ABS chains built up reversible crosslinks within the polymer networks, see Figure 11. These contributed to the strength and self-healing ability of the polymer. In addition, the hyperbranched structure enabled easy macromolecular movement in water. Water absorption of the polymer decreased with decreasing pH due to the increasing hydrophobicity of the system with increased protonation of the mercaptosuccinic acid. The acidity of the water was utilized to be beneficial to the process. Polymer samples were healed for 24 hours underwater and the healing efficiencies were reported as 87%, 65% and 48% with respect to tensile strength for pH 4, 7 and 9, respectively. This work demonstrated the use of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions to create a high performance self-healing polymer with affinity towards low-pH environments which could be applied to sealing elements, flexible hosepipes and linings. However, the long-term stability of the polymer matrix in the different water conditions and the surface ageing remains a challenge;, this is likely to be due to the hydrogen bonding present in the system. permission.

        <p>Cao et al. later developed a system which consisted of poly(vinylidene fluoride-cohexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) as the base polymer to build underwater self-healing polymers which could heal at the extremities of both acidic and basic conditions, as well as in air. [52] The system possessed strong dipole-dipole interaction bonding constants between the C-F bonds due to the electronegativity of fluorine. This provided the material a significant ionic character, removing the need for metal cations or ionic components that are likely to be affected by water molecules. In addition, the C-F bond possessed a strong electrostatic nature rendering a poor hydrogen bonding acceptor, decreasing the effects of the water environment. Hence, this polymer system showed a resistance to bond disruption in water due to the large amount of C-F bonds present. With regard to self-healing ability, a dibutyl phthalate plasticizer was used to reduce the 𝑇 𝑔 of the PVDF-HFP. This plasticizer was highly hydrophobic and compatible with the polymer, and was therefore stable in water. The polymer exhibited healing efficiencies of 22% and 30% when healed underwater with respect to fracture toughness at 3 and 24 hours of healing, respectively. These values were similar to those recovered from healing in air and in extremely acidic (pH ~ 1.3) and basic (pH ~ 13) waters for the same amount of time. Whilst the healing efficiency values are seemingly lower, they are stable in much harsher aqueous environments of extremely acidic and basic conditions, whilst still continuing to perform consistently in air and seawater. It was demonstrated that the polymers exhibited similar surface ageing in both air and water, however the swelling of the polymer system remains a concern for its applications.Cao et al. later developed a system which consisted of poly(vinylidene fluoride-cohexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) as the base polymer to build underwater self-healing polymers which could heal at the extremities of both acidic and basic conditions, as well as in air.

        <p>Polymeric swelling can lead to adverse effects on material properties by reducing the integrity of the chemical bonds. To combat this, Yoshie et al. used catechol functionalised acrylate polymers to prevent water uptake to reduce swelling-induced mechanical instability and improve self-healing functionality. [53] As shown in Figure 123A (a), after coordination with common Ca 2 or Mg 2+ in seawater, the resultant metallopolymers showed enhanced mechanical toughness of 5 MPa (MJ m -3 ) and self-healing efficiency of ~80% without obvious swelling due to the metal-catechol complexes and catechol-mediated interfacial hydrogen bonding. [53] This concept was improved by using p-phenyldiboronic acid (PDBA) as a crosslinker for the poly(dopamine acrylamide-co-n-butyl acrylate) polymer through non-ionic borate ester bonds [54] , see Figure 123B (b). The P-PDBA swelled only up to 2 wt% after three days of being submerged in seawater. This marginal swelling was key to its self-healing ability since the absorbed water slightly shifts the equilibrium dynamics of the esterification between catechol and boronic acid surface groups towards hydrolysis. The exposure of free catechol and boronic groups on the fracture surface leads to the formation of boronate ester bonds by esterification. The healing efficiency was reported to be 91% after three days of being submerged in seawater. This work demonstrated the potential of the catechol-based system with high self-healing efficiency and long-term stability, which is suitable for use in marinebased industries and applications.Polymeric swelling can lead to adverse effects on material properties by reducing the integrity of the chemical bonds.

        <p>A barrier coating is often applied to protect the metal surfaces from direct contact with environment, block the penetration of moisture or oxygen to the substrate surface, or even release corrosion inhibitors to slow down the corrosion process. However, coatings can easily lose these functions once they are pierced, cracked, or scratched, and a self-accelerating corrosion process can initiate from the metal surface as a result of an the attack by moisture or corrosive ions, which make it difficult to predict and prevent. Anti-corrosion coatings with selfhealing functions that are able to sustain external attacks such for UV, moisture, oxygen, heat or a corrosive environment, as well as have additional functions such as self-cleaning, pHsensing, or anti-fouling are in high demand. Frequently, these functionalities are complementary to eachone another. [57] Self-healing anticorrosion coatings are often based on an extrinsic self-healing mechanism and have been explored in sol-gel hybrid coatings and polymeric coatings, such as epoxy or polyurethane based composite coatings. The self-healing functions can be realized by incorporation of microcapsules loaded with healing agents, or encapsulated corrosion inhibitors, which will respond and inhibit the electrochemical reactions at the exposed metal surfaces. [58] Since the use of heavy metals such as Cr (VI), Cd, Pb and Hg are strictly controlled in anti-corrosion coatings due to their toxicity and environmental concerns, corrosion inhibitors such as phosphates, nitrites, molybdates, tungstates, vanadates, borates and rare earth salts, or organic corrosion inhibitors such as benzotriazole, mercaptobenzothiazole, imidazoline, 8hydroxyquinoline and aliphatic amines have been widely investigated.; [59] Mmore environmentally friendly inhibitors such as tannins, alkaloids, amino acids, and natural dyes have also attracted attention. [60] A variety of types of micro-/nano-containers have been studied for controlled-release of corrosion inhibitors. Natural or synthetic clays, such as montmorillonite, layered double hydroxide [61] , halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), graphene oxide, silica or polymeric capsules have often been used as nanocontainers in coatings.A barrier coating is often applied to protect the metal surfaces from direct contact with environment, block the penetration of moisture or oxygen to the substrate surface, or even release corrosion inhibitors to slow down the corrosion process.

Anti-corrosion coatings with selfhealing functions that are able to sustain external attacks such for UV, moisture, oxygen, heat or a corrosive environment, as well as have additional functions such as self-cleaning, pHsensing, or anti-fouling are in high demand. Frequently, these functionalities are complementary to eachone another. [57] Self-healing anticorrosion coatings are often based on an extrinsic self-healing mechanism and have been explored in sol-gel hybrid coatings and polymeric coatings, such as epoxy or polyurethane based composite coatings. The self-healing functions can be realized by incorporation of microcapsules loaded with healing agents, or encapsulated corrosion inhibitors, which will respond and inhibit the electrochemical reactions at the exposed metal surfaces. [58] Since the use of heavy metals such as Cr (VI), Cd, Pb and Hg are strictly controlled in anti-corrosion coatings due to their toxicity and environmental concerns, corrosion inhibitors such as phosphates, nitrites, molybdates, tungstates, vanadates, borates and rare earth salts, or organic corrosion inhibitors such as benzotriazole, mercaptobenzothiazole, imidazoline, 8hydroxyquinoline and aliphatic amines have been widely investigated.; [59] Mmore environmentally friendly inhibitors such as tannins, alkaloids, amino acids, and natural dyes have also attracted attention. [60] A variety of types of micro-/nano-containers have been studied for controlled-release of corrosion inhibitors. Natural or synthetic clays, such as montmorillonite, layered double hydroxide [61] , halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), graphene oxide, silica or polymeric capsules have often been used as nanocontainers in coatings.</p>
        <p>For example, sol-gel silica -zirconia hybrid coatings were used to protect 2024 aluminium alloys, where the silica nanoparticles can be surface-modified by covering layer-by-layer with polyelectrolyte and inhibitor layers. When using halloysite nanotubes as the nanocontainer, corrosion inhibitors such as benzotriazole [62] , 8-hydroxyquinoline or 2mercaptobenzothiazole [63] were loaded inside the lumen and the outer surface of the halloysite nanotube was further covered layer-by-layer with polyelectrolyte multilayers. The silicazirconia coatings containing the nanocontainers were able to release entrapped corrosion inhibitors in response to pH changes, and prevented the corrosion process after 24h of immersion in a dilute saline solution, showing good self-healing properties; [64] this system therefore provided an enhanced long-term corrosion protection.For example, sol-gel silica -zirconia hybrid coatings were used to protect 2024 aluminium alloys, where the silica nanoparticles can be surface-modified by covering layer-by-layer with polyelectrolyte and inhibitor layers.

        <p>For epoxy coating protected steel substrates, a dual-loaded halloysite (HHNT) containing a primary corrosion inhibitor imidazole (IM) in the inner lumens, and coating a secondary inhibitor dodecylamine (DDA) on the halloysite surface together with polyelectrolyte multilayers were investigated. As shown in Figure 145, the hybrid epoxy/HHNT (3 wt%) exhibited corrosion inhibition efficiencies of 99.8% for steel substrates, compared to 92% for the coating containing imidazole-loaded halloysite. The high anti-corrosion properties of hybrid coatings are attributed to the synergetic effect of the loaded inhibitors in halloysite and their efficient release signalled by localized pH change of the corrosive medium. In addition, the surface coating with multilayer of polyelectrolytes improved the dispersion of the halloysite nanocontainers. [65] Halloysite nanotubes loaded with three different inhibitors (Korantin SMK, Halox 520 and (NH4)2TiF6) were compared in epoxy composite coatings for steel substrates. By employing a neutral salt-spray test (5% NaCl, 35 °C), the epoxy coating containing 5 wt% of inhibitorloaded halloysite nanotubes showed improved anti-corrosion performance compared to a commercial epoxy coating containing 20 wt% of zinc phosphate. The addition of the free inhibitors into the coating without the use of halloysite nanotubes led to a deterioration of the corrosion protection level. The halloysite nanocontainer-impregnated coatings were able to sustain performance for over 1000 hours in a salt spray test. [66] When aminopropyltriethoxysilane modified halloysite nanotubes were double-doped with Zn 2+ and imidazole dicarboxylic acid (IDC), the modified epoxy ester coating provided a corrosion-inhibition efficiency of 90% for mild steel in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution in 24 hrs. After salt spray testing, a smaller disbonded area was observed for the scratched epoxy ester film bearing the double-doped halloysite nanotubes. The IDC acid carries two anionic carboxylic acid groups, which improved the release behaviour at an elevated pH, which usually occurs at cathodic sites. [67] The enhanced anticorrosion performance was ascribed to the precipitation of zinc hydroxide and a complex of Zn 2+ /Fe 2+ -IDC in the coating. [68] Figure Nyquist plot. Adapted with permission.

        <p>The overall coating performance can be affected by the extent of the uptake and release of containers, the prevention of premature leakage, the compatability between the container and coating matrix, and the cost and procedure. [69] Inorganic nanoparticles show benefit in terms of a controlled release of inhibitors for self-healing protective coatings, low cost and good mechanical reinforcement and hardness. However, their dispersion and compatibility within a polymer matrix are technically challenging for producing a homogeneous coating. In addition, the optimisation of the inhibitor loading and controlled release also require further investigation.The overall coating performance can be affected by the extent of the uptake and release of containers, the prevention of premature leakage, the compatability between the container and coating matrix, and the cost and procedure.

        <p>In comparison to inorganic nanoparticles, polymer microcapsules can be designed to be pHsensitive and rupture to release corrosion inhibitors in response to a pH change. Since corrosion leads to acidity changes on the reaction sites of the metal substrate, the aqueous solution near the cathode becomes basic due to reduction reactions of oxygen and/or protons. [69] A pHsensitive microcapsule composed of a cross-linked polyester shell and containing cerium nitrate as the inhibitor was designed to release the inhibitors in response to a hydrolysis reaction. [56,70] The under-film corrosion of a steel sheet was suppressed by addition of pH sensitive microcapsules to the coating matrix. The subsequent release of cerium ions was confirmed on a corroding steel surface. [70] It has also been reported that oleyl phosphate can be used as an effective dispersant for the dispersion of poly(urea-formaldehyde)-based microcapsules in an epoxy coating. [71] A microcapsule content of at least 15 wt% was required to efficiently restore the epoxy matrix, whilst providing corrosion protection to underlying low-carbon steel when the particles were not well dispersed. However, only 5 wt% of the microcapusules are needed to obtain good selfhealing and anticorrosion efficiencies when adding 0.5 wt% of oleyl phosphate as the dispersant, due to the improved dispersion of the microcapsules in the epoxy.In comparison to inorganic nanoparticles, polymer microcapsules can be designed to be pHsensitive and rupture to release corrosion inhibitors in response to a pH change.

        <p>Recently, a self-healing graphene microcapsule-thickened oil coating was reported to form a dynamic network and improve the stability of the metal substrate. Upon the introduction of damage to the coating, the oil flows rapidly to cover the exposed area, reconnecting the particle network. The flow properties of the oil-based coatings make them applicable for surfaces with complex geometries which help form a barrier coating that is free from pin-holes, both in air and in acidic water. The coating could self-heal repeatedly, even after scratching at the same spot 200 times. [72] A single layer epoxy nanocomposite coating containing titania nanotubes, loaded with dodecylamine as an inhibitor, and an epoxy monomer as the self-healing agent, showed combined self-healing ability and the corrosion inhibition effect on a carbon steel. The coated steel substrates were tested before and after scratching in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution for different times of immersion. The blank epoxy coating delaminated and deteriorated after five days, while the epoxy-coated steel that contained the healing additives exhibited a decreased corrosion rate after immersion in saline water for five days. The combined effect was based on a release of the monomer, the self-healing agent, and its successive crosslinking with amine immobilized in the nanotubes, as well as the release of the dodecylamine in the loaded nanotubes. After 10 and 15 days of immersion, the degree of corrosion was not fully controlled due to the insufficient dodecylamine content inside of the titania nanotubes. [73] Supramolecular chemistry was investigated for corrosion and biofouling prevention and has been discussed in a recent review. [74] The reversibility of supramolecular interactions offers both self-healing and responsiveness properties to coatings, although the non-covalent bonds may offset the barrier and stability of the coatings. It is proposed that partial replacement of covalent bonds with non-covalent bonds (up to 25%) may introduce a self-healing function without losing the barrier coating properties. [75] Therefore, the current status of the application of supramolecular chemistry in corrosion and biofouling prevention are mainly focused on forming microcapsules through supramolecular polymers, host-guest inclusion compounds, organic-inorganic hybrid materials, crown ethers or layer-by-layer assembled multilayers. and showed better performance than BTA-loaded halloysite and polyurethane/poly(ureaformaldehyde) microcapsules filled with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI@PU/PUF).Recently, a self-healing graphene microcapsule-thickened oil coating was reported to form a dynamic network and improve the stability of the metal substrate.

        <p>Self-healing under a vacuum or low pressure environment presents several unique challenges to self-healing materials. Firstly, their self-healing response to damage must be rapid, within seconds or even fractions of a second of the actual damage taking place since the environmental conditions maintained by the barrier material needs to be persevered upon damage. Examples where vacuum environments are important range from building materials, such as vacuum insulation panels, to aerospace environments in low earth orbit. Secondly, their self-healing mechanism must be autonomous upon the introduction of damage. Autonomy is needed since the location of damage may be inaccessible, and the time required to repair the damage needs to be as fast as possible. [78] As a result, three routes have been explored to date, which includes an oxygen dependent approach, an oxygen independent approach and a thermal approach. The oxygen dependent approach utilises oxygen that is leaking between environments from impact damage to initiate a polymerisation reaction to seal the hole. Zavada et al. used oxygen-initiated thiol-ene reactions between trialkylborane resins to polymerise immediately after the introduction of a puncture. Under an atmospheric oxygen atmosphere concentration (21%), the polymerisation reached 80% conversion within 30 seconds. [79] The healing mechanism involves oxygen that reacts with the tributylborane to form alkyl and alkoxy radicals. These radicals propagate the thiol-ene reaction by reacting further with trialkylboranes. [80] Due to the sensitivity of tributylborane to oxygen, the rate of the reaction was high, reported as 1.5 × 10 8 M -1 s -1 .Self-healing under a vacuum or low pressure environment presents several unique challenges to self-healing materials.

        <p>Further testing by placing the trialkylborane resin in a tri-layered structure was investigated to simulate a spacecraft wall.

        <p>The second approach uses an oxygen independent pathway and utilizes either a curing agent or an acid catalyst to heal a puncture. A curing agent is able to react with the epoxy structure to seal a hole and prevent any further loss of vacuum. This can be implemented for vacuum insulation panels using a five layered structure, using a separator to prevent the epoxy and the curing agent from prematurely reacting, as shown in Figure 189. [81] Vacuum insulation panels are building materials which help improve the heating efficiency of buildings due to a higher thermal resistance compared to traditional building insulation materials. [82] However, once damaged by accidental cuts in service or during installation, the subsequent loss of the vacuum within the panel leads to a loss of their insulation properties.

        <p>As an example, an Epon 8111 structure using a poly(ethyleneimine) curing agent was utilised in a vacuum insulation panel. The vacuum panel was punctured using either a needle or a screw and upon puncturing with a needle, the air pressure inside the vacuum increased as the needles were hollow, allowing air leakage. However, in both cases where a needle and a screw was used, self-healing was able to take place within ten seconds to prevent further air ingress to the vacuum panels. [81] In addition, microvasularised polymer sheets containing two microvascular networks were designed to self-heal by combining two epoxy resins, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), with an acid catalyst. In addition, whilst the vascular system was designed to heal larger macroscopic cracks, a microcapsule network was also established using the same system to heal smaller microscopic cracks, as seen in Figure 1920.As an example, an Epon 8111 structure using a poly(ethyleneimine) curing agent was utilised in a vacuum insulation panel.

        <p>Another route to self-healing under vacuum environments is to utilise a thermal approach to polymerise and seal damage due to atomic oxygen in a low earth orbit environment. Atomic oxygen can degrade materials by breaking covalent bonds due to their high energy. [85,86] This is particularly useful in the case of spacecraft where the temperature on the surface of the spacecraft can fluctuate between -100 °C to +100 °C depending on whether the space craft is in the earth's shadow or not. [85,87] Therefore, atomic oxygen resistant 2-ureido-4[1H]pyrimidinone (UPy) functionalised polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) coatings were developed by Wang et al. The UPy groups exhibited four potential hydrogen bonding sites, allowing temperature dependent self-healing to be utilised. [88] At 80 °C, the hydrogen bonds could be overcome so that they could break and then reform upon cooling to heal cracked surfaces from damage to the coating. A maximum crack width healing of 1.1 μm was found when subjected to 100 °C for 2 minutes. Due to the dynamic interactions present for self-healing, the UPy-POSS coating was found to be able to undergo multiple self-healing cycles. [88] Overall, research into self-healing under vacuum environments is still in its early infancy.Another route to self-healing under vacuum environments is to utilise a thermal approach to polymerise and seal damage due to atomic oxygen in a low earth orbit environment.

        <p>Long term exposure to ultra-violet (UV) radiation can lead to significant degradation of a large range of materials. UV radiation can result in photo-oxidative degradation that leads to breaking of polymer chains, production of radicals, reduction in molecular weight and causes deterioration of mechanical properties after an unpredictable amount of time. [89] Polymeric materials are used for infrastructure and vehicle applications due to their low cost and ease of manufacturing, where they are exposed to solar radiation. This radiation is particularly more harsh in a space environment, where there is no stratosphere filter for higher frequency or shorter wavelength UV radiation; this can commonly induce the formation and propagation of microcracks in polymeric materials. [90] The extreme environment in this sense refers to an environment in which there is constant exposure to UV radiation. Researchers have developed methods to combat UV-triggered degenerative processes by taking advantage of light as the self-healing source, this is particularly important in situations where human intervention is inconvenient. Photo-crosslinking reactions, photoinduced metathesis and material heating are some possible effects of light irradiation that can initiate the self-healing process. [91] The advantages of light-stimulated self-healing include an ability to operate remotely/autonomously, low cost and it can exploit readily available light sources to provide localized healing whereby damaged areas can be repaired without disrupting undamaged areas. [92,93] The use of UV to act as the self-healing mechanism for extrinsic healing using microcapsules has been reported widely, and can be used to heal either UV induced degradation or mechanical damage. Guo et al. encapsulated an epoxy resin and a cationic photo-initiator into a single SiO2 microcapsule through a combined interfacial/in situ polymerization strategy, which was embedded into an epoxy resin coating. [90] Microcrack formation from UV light led to microcapsule rupture, leading to the release of the epoxy resin and photo-initiator simultaneously due to a capillary effect which subsequently fills the crack. When irradiated, the epoxy groups are consumed due to their ring-opening reaction. There was an 89% conversion of the epoxy groups in 30 minutes of radiation. This self-healing system also showed resistance to long-term thermal cycling which is significant for aerospace applications.Long term exposure to ultra-violet (UV) radiation can lead to significant degradation of a large range of materials. UV radiation can result in photo-oxidative degradation that leads to breaking of polymer chains, production of radicals, reduction in molecular weight and causes deterioration of mechanical properties after an unpredictable amount of time. [89] Polymeric materials are used for infrastructure and vehicle applications due to their low cost and ease of manufacturing, where they are exposed to solar radiation.

[96] When the polyurethane was irradiated with 350 nm UV light, the double bonds of 4methylcoumarin gradually dimerized to form cyclobutane rings, resulting in destruction of the conjugation between the double bonds and phenyl groups, see Figure 201. Conversely, when the polyurethane was irradiated with 254 nm UV light, the cyclobutane derivatives are recovered to 4-methylcoumarin monomers, decreasing dimerization. To evaluate the selfhealing properties, room temperature tensile tests were conducted on the initially cross-linked (350 nm) polyurethane specimens.

[99] The photothermal effect controlled the shape memory process by tuning the temperature of the crystalline phase and activated the self-healing process through crystal melting and recrystallization. A film of an initial defined shape was stretched at 80 o C to 400% strain, which was followed by cooling to room temperature to fix the temporary shape.

        <p>The presence of microcracks and defects in a polymer can lead to electrical treeing under the presence of an electric field, causing leading to short service lifetimes and failure and short service lifetimes. [106] The electric field at which electrical treeing propagates can be hard to predict, leading to failure at a much lower electric field than for an undamaged polymer. This is especially challenging for high voltage cabling, such as undersea power cabling or within modern aircraft. Modern aircraft contain up to 200 miles of cabling, and severe damage is caused through vibrations, flexing and salt corrosion. The defects caused by this damage can act as sites for failure. In addition, electrical aging of the protective polymer sheath can occur, creating free radicals within the polymer and propagating the failure of the polymer. [107] This was shown to be inhibited in oxygen free environments as molecular oxygen assists with free radial degradation.

        <p>To date, both intrinsic approaches, through dynamic bonds, and extrinsic approaches, through microcapsules and oil based systems have been utilised to successfully recover damage initiated from electrical fields. [109] The use of microcapsules has been demonstrated by Lesaint et al. as a method for inhibiting electrical treeing. They introduced urea-formaldehyde based microcapsules into epoxy resin prior to casting filled with dicyclopentadiene, as shown in Figure 23. As the electrical tree propagated through the epoxy resin, the microcapsules ruptured and filled the tree. However, as noted by the authors, the ability of the healing agent to fill the cracks of the tree depends on the viscosity of the liquid, surface tension of the epoxy crack walls and the partial pressure for filling the region. [106] Thus, most of the site can be healed to delay further failure. [110] However, any unfilled regions act as sites for initiation of electrical released from the microcapsule rupture, as shown in Figure 223. [111] Hybrid core-shell microcapsules were synthesised via one-step Pickering emulsion polymerization between ureaformaldehyde and TiO2, incorporating the latter to protect the bisphenol A epoxy acrylate healing agents from electroluminescence during electrical treeing. The luminescence was thought to arise from the recombination betweenof charge carriers injected from the electrodes and , in addition withthe impact excitation of polymer molecules by accelerated electrons. In this system, Weibull breakdown voltages of the healed polymers (35.2 kV) yielded higher values than their original counterparts (33.5 kV). These qualities are attractive for integration into dielectric materials for electronic and energy applications.To date, both intrinsic approaches, through dynamic bonds, and extrinsic approaches, through microcapsules and oil based systems have been utilised to successfully recover damage initiated from electrical fields.

        <p>As an alternative to microcapsules, a naturally derived 'drying oil' from alkyl benzene fluid and tung oil was demonstrated by Basu et al. which reacted upon exposure to air. The drying oil filled the space before curing and repaired the site through a curing reaction. After healing, the breakdown voltage of the healed site recovered to 85 kV m -1 . In addition, they proposed an unsaturated oil-based system, in which crosslinking the oil acted as the repair mechanism instead of curing. However, the crosslinking process was too slow to repair successfully cables in a real-world environment. [112] Alternatively, an intrinsic self-healing functionality for electroactive polymers can allow them to withstand high electric fields. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a class of electroactive polymers that are that able to deform due to the electrostatic interaction between two electrodes with opposite electric charge; this was, which wasfirst demonstrated in 1880 by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen by who spraying sprayed charges onto a piece of natural rubber. [113] It has attracted much interest and research on actuator configurations, material properties and enhancement of actuator performance over the past decade. Structural defects occur in Ultra-thin self-clearable carbon nanotube based electrodes for improved performance of dielectric elastomer actuators were developed in 2008. [114] These ultra-thin electrodes exhibit fault-tolerance in dielectric elastomers through the local degradation of carbon nanotubes during dielectric breakdownelectical breakdown at a voltage of 3 kVunder a 3 kV voltage, which can be implemented in dielectric elastomer artificial muscles and soft robots. To enable enable ease ofy manufactureing, Michel et al. [115] developed a printable, and self-healing electrode based on 20 wt% reduced graphite nanoplatelets in silicone for dielectric elastomer actuators. The actuator electrode strength could be recovered aAfter dielectric breakdown voltage of under aat an applied voltage of 2.4 kV applied voltage, the electrical properties could be recovered, withand no memory or hysteresis effect is observed in the during furtherfuerther cyclic actuation testing and breakdown. To achieve high strain actuation, Liu et al. [116] developed highly conductive and compliant self-healing liquid metal electrode for high strain dielectric actuators. With the additional self-healing capacity, the dielectric elastomer actuator was more fault tolerant and resilient to extreme non-ideal environmentsal conditions. The actuator was able to achieve a 360% strain with an electrode breakdown voltage as high as tobefore the electrode brokedown under aat an applied voltage of 3.5 kV applied voltage, with highlighting potential uses infor artificial muscles, flexible electronics and wearable device based applicationss.As an alternative to microcapsules, a naturally derived 'drying oil' from alkyl benzene fluid and tung oil was demonstrated by Basu et al. which reacted upon exposure to air.

Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a class of electroactive polymers that are that able to deform due to the electrostatic interaction between two electrodes with opposite electric charge; this was, which wasfirst demonstrated in 1880 by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen by who spraying sprayed charges onto a piece of natural rubber. [113] It has attracted much interest and research on actuator configurations, material properties and enhancement of actuator performance over the past decade. Structural defects occur in Ultra-thin self-clearable carbon nanotube based electrodes for improved performance of dielectric elastomer actuators were developed in 2008. [114] These ultra-thin electrodes exhibit fault-tolerance in dielectric elastomers through the local degradation of carbon nanotubes during dielectric breakdownelectical breakdown at a voltage of 3 kVunder a 3 kV voltage, which can be implemented in dielectric elastomer artificial muscles and soft robots. To enable enable ease ofy manufactureing, Michel et al. [115] developed a printable, and self-healing electrode based on 20 wt% reduced graphite nanoplatelets in silicone for dielectric elastomer actuators. The actuator electrode strength could be recovered aAfter dielectric breakdown voltage of under aat an applied voltage of 2.4 kV applied voltage, the electrical properties could be recovered, withand no memory or hysteresis effect is observed in the during furtherfuerther cyclic actuation testing and breakdown. To achieve high strain actuation, Liu et al. [116] developed highly conductive and compliant self-healing liquid metal electrode for high strain dielectric actuators. With the additional self-healing capacity, the dielectric elastomer actuator was more fault tolerant and resilient to extreme non-ideal environmentsal conditions. The actuator was able to achieve a 360% strain with an electrode breakdown voltage as high as tobefore the electrode brokedown under aat an applied voltage of 3.5 kV applied voltage, with highlighting potential uses infor artificial muscles, flexible electronics and wearable device based applicationss.</p>
        <p>A new self-healing dielectric elastomer actuator was developed using a two-phase dielectric utilising an open-cell silicone sponge design that was saturated with silicone oil. [117] Upon damage, the oil flows into the voids, thereby reforming the dielectric structure. The sponge acts to hold the oil in place and reinforces stability, while the oil maintains integrity of the dielectric layer. During testing, the actuator was initially subjected to a voltage was of 3.0 kV at a frequency of 1 Hz and incrementally increased to failure at a 5 kV applied voltage. The actuator healed and the same strain was achieved after the driven voltage decreased to 3 kV within 1s.A new self-healing dielectric elastomer actuator was developed using a two-phase dielectric utilising an open-cell silicone sponge design that was saturated with silicone oil.

        <p>High magnetic field environments possess a unique challenge for self-healing polymers, since it requires a stimulus to initiate self-healing. As seen in a number of examples throughout this review, an external energy source is often required to initiate self-healing, such as heat or light, which presents a danger if additional equipment is needed to provide the energy source and a large magnetic field is present -especially if the location of the damage is in a difficult to reach or is located in obscured position. [123] Therefore, the extrinsic modification of polymers by incorporating magnetic fillers into a thermoplastic polymer matrices provides an intriguing approach to introduce self-healing in a high magnetic field environment. With regards to intrinsic modification, there is currently no work to introduce self-healing with a magnetic field stimulus and is worthy of future interest.High magnetic field environments possess a unique challenge for self-healing polymers, since it requires a stimulus to initiate self-healing.

        <p>A thermoplastic silicone based copolymer of monomethacryloxypropyl terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) and 6-methyl-2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidone-bearing methacrylate was mixed with up to 20 wt% of iron oxide (Fe3O4) particles via solution mixing. [128] The applied healing stimulus was an alternating magnetic field (AMF) to elastomers after 20 mins, and demonstrated a recovered tensile strain of 78% and a recovered tensile stress of 70%. The magnetic based self-healing approach showed better self-healing than directly heating the elastomers to 55 °C. This was attributed to the 2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidone hydrogen bonding limiting the thermo-reversibility of the polymer, indicating that a larger increase in the thermal energy is required to promote the rearrangement of hydrogen bonding, as shown in Figure 25.A thermoplastic silicone based copolymer of monomethacryloxypropyl terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) and 6-methyl-2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidone-bearing methacrylate was mixed with up to 20 wt% of iron oxide (Fe3O4) particles via solution mixing.

        <p>Exploiting the shape memory properties of polymers for self-healing under a magnetic field is a novel approach to repair polymers for biomedical applications, such as coated guidewires. [132] The so called 'SMASH' polymers (shape memory assisted self-healing) enable the polymer to firstly change to its original shape under an external stimulus, which is then followed by the healing stage. [133] After failure of a poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) polymer containing Mn0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 nanoparticles through excessive strain, the application of an alternating magnetic field triggered a shape memory response to recover its original shape. After shape recovery, chain entanglement took place at the polymer interface for the two pieces to heal; the healing time was 10 minutes. In addition, an attached chromophore in the sample changed colour due to strain induced damage causing disaggregation of the chromophore. [132] Upon selfhealing, the chromophore also returned to its original colour to provide a visual signal. The addition of a strain sensing chromophore could be utilised in general for polymers in harsh environmental conditions or when in a poorly accessible locality to demonstrate when they are under strain or beginning to fail.Exploiting the shape memory properties of polymers for self-healing under a magnetic field is a novel approach to repair polymers for biomedical applications, such as coated guidewires.

        <p>Such polymers can limit the need for human intervention in order to repair components and devices within these environments, which can be potentially high risk or threating to life. In addition, their use can reduce the cost of expensive repairs for inaccessible or remote components, prolong their service life, and maintaining their operational performance.

        <p>however, this approach is irreversible and limited to a single healing operation. Extrinsic microvascular networks allow multiple self-healing events, however, their fabrication can be difficult, time consuming and expensive. In comparison, intrinsic self-healing in extreme environments relies on the macromolecular design of polymer structures. High self-healing efficiencies and, theoretically, an infinite number of self-healing cycles can be achieved through dynamic covalent bonds or non-covalent interactions. This latter approach offers versatile opportunities for a smart and truly biomimetic design.however, this approach is irreversible and limited to a single healing operation.

        <p>Over the last 25 years, advances in synthetic polymer chemistry and the development of reversible deactivation radical polymerisation (RDRP) methods have provided unprecedented control over the molecular weight, composition, architecture, and functionality of polymeric materials. However, to date there have been limited reports where these techniques have been used in the development of polymers that can function and self-heal in extreme environments.Over the last 25 years, advances in synthetic polymer chemistry and the development of reversible deactivation radical polymerisation (RDRP) methods have provided unprecedented control over the molecular weight, composition, architecture, and functionality of polymeric materials.

        <p>Future work in this area should focus on using the synthetic control offered by RDRP techniques, such as reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerisation and atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP), to design polymers that have the functionality for dynamic bonding evenly distributed through each polymer chain, or that are confined in single blocks, [136] or the terminal groups of large dendritic structures. These techniques offer the potential to build on and optimise the results achieved through the functionalisation of commercial materials to enable mass manufacture and low-cost processing of self-healing polymers.Future work in this area should focus on using the synthetic control offered by RDRP techniques, such as reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerisation and atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP), to design polymers that have the functionality for dynamic bonding evenly distributed through each polymer chain, or that are confined in single blocks, [136] or the terminal groups of large dendritic structures.

        <p>Each extreme environment presents a specific technical challenge which must be overcome within the polymer design for successful and efficient self-healing to take place. For example, the low temperature environment represents kinetic challenges for the rate of the reaction. In extreme environments such as the deep ocean there is an additional challenge of requiring selfhealing mechanisms that are not disrupted by the presence of water molecules, high salinity, or high-pressure. Due to the limited investigations on self-healing materials for extreme environments, many pathways remain unexplored for each environment, and there are opportunities for the development of new structures and chemistries that allow for the range of current, and well understood, healing mechanisms to be extended into extreme environments.Each extreme environment presents a specific technical challenge which must be overcome within the polymer design for successful and efficient self-healing to take place.

        <p>In addition to the self-healing mechanism, the physical, thermal and viscoelastic properties of the polymer must be carefully considered for each different extreme environment. For example, to achieve healing in a high intensity UV light environment, polymer chains need to be designed which are also resilient to photo-induced chain scission. Therefore, for each extreme environment presented, careful consideration of the responsiveness of polymer chains needs to be considered. Nevertheless, there are also opportunities to take advantage of the unique conditions of each extreme environment to create new self-healing mechanisms; this can include exploiting the thermal energy associated with high temperature operation, the presence of high energy UV light and high electrical/magnetic fields. In terms of self-healing under a magnetic field, approaches to date have focussed on the Néel relaxation of fillers, and there is currently no intrinsic self-healing approach that utilises the magnetic field to stimulate selfhealing.In addition to the self-healing mechanism, the physical, thermal and viscoelastic properties of the polymer must be carefully considered for each different extreme environment.

        <p>This can be facilitated by the creation of higher technology readiness (TRL) prototypes that demonstrate structures or devices that self-heal in extreme environments to highlight the potential of the technology, for example in aircraft skins or marine structures.
