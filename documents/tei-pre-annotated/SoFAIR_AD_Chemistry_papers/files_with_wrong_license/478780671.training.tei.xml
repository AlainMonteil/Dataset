        <p>Toluene is one of the pollutants that are dangerous to the environment and human health and has been sorted into priority pollutants; hence the control of its emission is necessary. Due to severe problems caused by toluene, different techniques for the abatement of toluene have been developed.</p>
        <p>Catalytic oxidation is one of the promising methods and effective technologies for toluene degradation as it oxidizes it to CO2 and does not deliver other pollutants to the environment. This paper highlights the recent progressive advancement of the catalysts for toluene oxidation. Five categories of catalysts, including noble metal catalysts, transition metal catalysts, perovskite catalysts, metal-organic framework (MOFs)-based catalysts, and spinel catalysts reported in the past half a decade (2015-2020), are reviewed. Various factors that influence their catalytic activities, such as morphology and structure, preparation methods, specific surface area, relative humidity, and coke formation, are discussed. Furthermore, the reaction mechanisms and kinetics for catalytic oxidation of toluene are also discussed.</p>
        <p>Toluene is a volatile organic compound (VOC) known to be harmful to human health and the environment (Carrillo and Carriazo 2015;Liu et al. 2015;Narayanan et al. 2015;Romero et al. 2015). Naturally, toluene is found in tolu trees and crude oil. It is generated in some anthropogenic activities like manufacturing processes of fuels and coke. It is commonly used in the production processes of paint, adhesives, fingernail polish, rubber, and lacquers. It is also used in benzene, plastics, nylon, and polyurethane production, and in the synthesis reaction of toluene diisocyanate, benzoic acid, trinitrotoluene (TNT), and benzoyl chloride, thus playing a crucial role in daily human life and industrial development for the past several decades (Zhang et al. 2019a). However, due to its toxicity and volatility, toluene has been recorded in Pollutant Released and Transfer Register (PRTR) in many countries (Nunotani et al. 2020).</p>
        <p>The toluene concentration in ambient air is not the same in different areas. In rural areas, it has been found generally to be &lt; 5 µg/m 3 , while in urban sites it could be in the range of 5 to 150 µg/m 3 ; but its concentration may be even higher in the areas closer to the emission sources (Bravo et al. 2002). Exposure to toluene may cause serious health problems such as brain and nervous system disorders that can be temporary, like dizziness, headaches, or unconsciousness. For repeated exposure of the concentrations prohibited by international solvent, some effects like vision and hearing loss, cognitive impairment, and incoordination may be permanent (Lerner et al. 2012). Long-term exposure for pregnant people can cause mental growth and abilities retardation in children, and sometimes spontaneous abortions may take place. Other serious problems related to human health may include liver, immune, reproductive, and kidney effects (Lerner et al. 2012).</p>
        <p>Besides, toluene has been found to have carcinogenic, mutagenic, developmental, and teratogenic effects on humans and animals. Toluene is also harmful to the environment, where it contributes to the formation of photochemical smog, climate change, and destruction of the ozone layer (Zhang et al. 2016;Xu et al. 2015b). Therefore, effective technologies to remove toluene from contaminated gas streams are needed to improve the ambient air quality as well as to protect human health.</p>
        <p>From the literature, various approaches for abatement of toluene have been proposed and reported, including thermal or non-thermal catalytic oxidation, adsorption (Hu et al. 2017;Uzuki et al. 2018;Mekki and Boukoussa 2019;Song et al. 2019;Yin et al. 2019), and photocatalytic oxidation, etc. (Mills and O'Rourke 2012;Sun et al. 2017;Qiu et al. 2018;Lee et al. 2019;Zhu et al. 2019a;Xie et al. 2020). The adsorption process has been widely used due to the lowest cost, simplicity to easy design and operation; however, it suffers from well-recognized restrictions, including the limited adsorption capacity, relative humidity (RH) impact, and pollutants released during regeneration of the material by desorption (Peta et al. 2018;Thanh et al. 2018a).</p>
        <p>Photocatalytic oxidation has been applied for the abatement of toluene due to its advantages like a wide range of applications, higher mineralization ability, lower oxidation temperature, simple conditions to operate, and little secondary pollutants released (Li et al. 2020;Li &amp; Ma 2021;Ezeh et al 2018); but it was reported to have drawbacks, which mainly include its high recombination rate of holes and electrons or photons and the narrow overlap between the sunlight and photocatalyst's absorption spectrum (Xie et al. 2020;Tomatis et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>Toluene's catalytic oxidation has been widely used as an alternative solution due to its high efficiency in removing toluene as it can convert it entirely to CO2 and H2O with no release of other secondary pollutants to the environment (Hoseini et al. 2019;Zhang et al. 2019b). But in practical application, this technique is still facing different challenges. One is synthesizing a catalyst that can achieve 100% toluene conversion at a possible lower reaction temperature for energy saving.</p>
        <p>Current catalytic technology for removing toluene and other VOCs from coal-fired flue gas is the selective catalytic reduction with NH3 (NH3-SCR), which normally uses the V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalysts but needs high temperature above 340 °C and the efficiency for the oxidation of VOCs is still lower than 50% (Wu et al. 2016;Han et al. 2019). During the industrial process implementation, energy is the first issue to think about, especially for the treatment of exhaust gases (Gan et al. 2019). Efficient thermal catalysts can lower the operating temperatures to save the auxiliary fuel consumption and the need for advanced thermal insulation or thermally stable construction materials (Tomatis et al., 2019). Besides, the cost of a catalyst and its ability to tolerate the moisture in the reaction atmosphere are also important factors to be taken into account for practical uses. Up to the present, a significant number of active catalysts for toluene oxidation or combustion have been reported, and it has seen that total oxidation of toluene can be achieved catalytically at low temperature (Torrente-murciano et al. 2017;Zhu et al. 2018a) and even at room temperature (Liu et al. 2015;Ryu et al. 2019); thus it appears to be a promising technique for removing toluene. Previous reviews of toluene's catalytic oxidation have commonly focused on only one type of catalyst. For instance, Lyu et al. (2020) reviewed toluene catalytic removal, but they focused only on Mn-based catalysts. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2015) reported catalytic oxidation of toluene by focusing only on one type of catalyst (mesoporous silica-based catalysts).</p>
        <p>Up to now, there is almost no article available that comprehensively reviewed various types of catalysts used for thermal oxidation of toluene particularly in flue gases. The recent one was reported by Cui et al. (2016) where they focused on the status and progress of treatment technologies of toluene in the industrial waste gas; however, that article is with short English abstract but the full paper is only available in the Chinese language, which makes it difficult to be shared with the international research communities.</p>
        <p>According to the reported literature, it can be easily seen that significant advancement in catalytic oxidation of toluene has been done using different methods. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no report has made on the review of catalytic oxidation techniques of toluene in detail, considering different types of catalysts. Thus, this literature review will be beneficial to the environmental researchers better to understand recent progress on catalytic oxidation of toluene.</p>
        <p>Besides, it may further attract researchers' attention and encourage them to conduct studies on toluene remediation technologies. This review emphasizes the current progressive research over a half-decade on catalysts for toluene oxidation especially including noble metal-based catalysts, transition metal-based catalysts, perovskite catalysts, metal-organic framework (MOFs)-based catalysts, core-shell catalysts, and spinel catalysts; also, reaction mechanisms are summarized, and future perspectives are identified.</p>
        <p>Noble metal-based catalysts generally have better catalytic activity for toluene combustion than transition metal oxides catalysts (Santos et al. 2010). Noble metals like platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), gold (Au), and silver (Ag) are commonly used in the toluene's catalytic oxidation, where they work as active phases of the catalysts. These materials can be utilized as single metals or bimetallic composites loaded on different supports, as is shown in Tables 1 and2, and they have been found to have the highest toluene oxidation activity at low temperatures, even less than 100 °C (Torrente-murciano et al. 2017;Zhu et al. 2018b). Nonetheless, noble metals are extremely expensive with limited resources, and this will make noble metal-based catalysts costly, which will be a limitation for their wide industrial application. Thus, to overcome this challenge, numerous research efforts have been done to improve the catalyst by raising the spread of noble metals on their supports through different preparation techniques. Therefore, the one-step synthesis method could be a promising solution to increase the dispersion of active phases on the support during the preparation of noble metal-based catalysts (Fu et al. 2016) as the traditional wet impregnation method showed limitations in the doped particles' stabilization and distribution (Sun et al, 2019;Debecker et al. 2010).</p>
        <p>Pt-based catalysts are mostly used as monometallic catalysts supported on various supports for toluene oxidation (Table 1). They show an excellent activity for the removal of toluene at reaction temperatures ranging between 150 and 200 °C (Table 1). Pt has been found to be an excellent active element for aromatic structure oxidation (Peng et al. 2016). Pt catalysts supported with different supports, including zeolites, CeO2, Al2O3, and molecular sieves, have been prepared and tested for toluene oxidation (Chen et al. 2013;Peng et al. 2016;Gan et al. 2019). The size and dispersion of Pt on the support surface significantly influence the catalyst activity. To study the effect of Pt size on the catalytic activity, various sizes of Pt nanoparticles (1.3 to 2.5 nm) were synthesized and loaded on CeO2 as support. Structural and chemical properties were highly depended on Pt size, and it was realized that the dispersion of Pt decreases with the increase of its size. The prepared catalysts were tested on 1000ppm of toluene with 48000 mL•g -1 •h -1 of GHSV.</p>
        <p>Pt-1.8/CeO2 exhibited better catalytic activity where it was able to reach T50 and T90 at 132 and 143 °C respectively, due to the balanced concentration of oxygen vacancy and dispersion of Pt (Peng et al. 2018). Similarly, the role of Pt particle size for total toluene oxidation over Pt/ZSM-5 was investigated and various catalysts with different sizes (1.3-2.3 nm) of Pt particles were synthesized and tested (Chen et al. 2015a). Of the tested catalysts, a catalyst of 1.9 nm of mean particle diameter showed the highest performance where 98% of toluene conversion was observed at 155 °C with gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 60,000 mL•g -1 •h -1 . The most increased activity of Pt-1.9/ZSM-5 was ascribed to the balanced dispersion of Pt and the proportion of Pt 0 in the catalyst. To explain this, the relationship between Pt 0 and Pt size was studied and it was found that Pt 0 proportion was increased with the size of Pt particle, which was ascribed to the interaction between the active metal and support (An et al. 2013). Smaller nanoparticles of Pt could have higher interaction with support which results in a high chemical state of Pt species. On the contrary, larger nanoparticles of Pt have weak interaction with support, leading to the formation of more species of Pt 0 which are the active centers for the complete oxidation of toluene (Chen et al. 2014).</p>
        <p>On another side, the dispersion of Pt strongly influences the activity of the catalyst. Again, the dispersion of Pt is decreased with the increase of Pt size (Chen et al. 2015a). Thus, the balance between the dispersion of Pt and the proportion of Pt 0 can affect the catalytic activity of the catalyst.</p>
        <p>Recently, zeolitic mesoporous materials were prepared to attempt the combination of zeolitic and mesoporous properties (Kim et al. 2010). Pt particles were immobilized on the material surface and tested for toluene destruction. Mesoporous beta zeolite-supported Pt was found to exhibit the highest performance compared to the other catalysts synthesized on beta zeolite. The highest activity was ascribed to the dispersion of Pt and the ratio of Pt 0 /Pt 2+ (Chen et al. 2013). Pt 0 proportion of Pt catalyst supported on mesoporous ZSM-5 could be enhanced by the doping of alkali metals such as Na, Cs, and K, which could also ameliorate the activity of the catalyst (Chen et al. 2015b).</p>
        <p>The catalytic activity of Pt catalysts could be promoted by different dopants like tungsten as reported by Hou et al. 2019, who studied the tungsten effect for promoting the toluene catalytic activity of monolith Pt/Ce0.65Zr0.35O2 and it was found that the incorporation of tungsten in monolith Pt/Ce0.65Zr0.35O2 facilitated the decrease of 30 °C to the required temperature for the total conversion of toluene compared to the one needed by Pt/Ce0.65Zr0.35O2 for degrading 1000ppm of toluene under 12000 h -1 of GHSV. The best performance of this catalyst was due to the increase of surface acidity and adsorbed oxygen caused by the addition of WO3.</p>
        <p>Toluene oxidation can also be catalytically affected by the shape of the support for Pt-based catalyst. For instance, the shape effect of Pt/CeO2 on toluene oxidation was investigated and three different shapes of CeO2 such as nanoparticles, nanorods and, nanocubes were used (Peng et al. 2016). It was found that the amount of Ce 3+ is estimated to be 32.9%, 29.7% and 27.3% for Pt/CeO2-r, Pt/CeO2-p and Pt/CeO2-c, respectively. The high concentration of Ce 3+ ions on the surface of Pt/CeO2-r sample reflects the high concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. For pure CeO2 supports, the reduction of surface or subsurface oxygen occurs with the maxima at 428 °C, 380 °C and 510 °C for CeO2-r, CeO2-p and CeO2-c, respectively. And the total H2 consumptions follows such a sequence: CeO2-r (718 μmol g -1 ) &gt; CeO2-p (275 μmol g -1 ) &gt; CeO2-c (89.6 μmol g - 1 ), indicating that the reduction of CeO2 is influenced significantly by the exposed shape. It also indicated that more subsurface lattice oxygen of Pt/CeO2-r had been reduced, which was probably due to the spillover effect on the subsurface oxygen below the Pt species. The H2-TPR study clearly demonstrated that the incorporation of Pt would activate the lattice oxygen on surface/subsurface of CeO2 and promote the reducibility, especially for Pt/CeO2-r. In the moisturized environment, Pt-based catalysts are negatively affected by deactivation due to water adsorption on the support (Sedjame et al. 2014). In some cases, the utilization of supports that are hydrophobic can be advantageous as they can be involved in the expulsion of water vapor from the surfaces of the catalyst.</p>
        <p>From the reported research work, Pt catalysts have shown more activity at a lower temperature compared to other noble metals catalysts for toluene oxidation. However, few studies have reported the Pt effect on the active oxygen of the catalysts. For the exploration of their potentials, further research can focus on the quantitative analysis and the improvement of active surface oxygen by different dopants to increase the catalyst performance.</p>
        <p>Au is less expensive compared to Pd and Pt. Au-based catalysts catalyze the oxidation of toluene at a higher reaction temperature (200 -400 °C), but under some circumstances, it can work at a lower temperature (&lt; 100 °C). For example, the removal of toluene using supported nanogold/metal oxides catalysts was investigated, and it was shown that the prepared gold-catalysts (nano-Au/Fe2O3/GAC and nano-Au/CeO2/GAC) were able to achieve toluene removal of 80% at the reaction temperature of 75 °C (Thanh et al. 2018). There are different methods to synthesize Au-based catalysts, such as chemical vapor deposition, deposition-precipitation, and cation adsorption methods (Liotta 2014). From the literature, it has been found that compared to other supports, gold catalysts supported on metal oxide supports showed excellent performance towards toluene oxidation (Carabineiro et al. 2015;Sun et al. 2019a).</p>
        <p>The catalytic performance of Au catalysts can be influenced by a few factors such as the types of supports and the size of dispersed Au particles (Han et al. 2014). In one investigation, the support effect on the performance of Au particles for the oxidation of toluene was studied where MgO, Fe2O3, NiO, and La2O3 were used as supports to prepare gold-based catalysts, and it was realized that the activity of the prepared catalyst was majorly affected by reducibility and the size of the crystal while the gold oxidation state did not show any distinctive impact on the catalyst's activity (Carabineiro et al. 2015). Catalysts of Au immobilized on 3DOM structured materials were studied and it was found that 3DOM perovskite materials like LaSrCoOx and LaSrMnOx are suitable supporting materials of Au particles due to their structured 3D pores and high surface area (Jiang et al. 2017). In another separate study, Au catalyst supported on La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 was explored and the prepared catalyst showed excellent performance towards the oxidation of toluene where the conversion of 50 and 90% were reached at a temperature of 205 and 220 °C, respectively (Jiang et al. 2015).</p>
        <p>Previous investigators have determined that the incorporation of transition metal oxides to supported noble metal catalyst (SNMC) could enhance the catalytic activity for the oxidation of VOC, and this was found to be the case for toluene oxidation. Au/MnOx/3DOM SiO2 as a highly effective gold-based catalyst for the oxidation of toluene was studied and it was determined that Mnx/3DOM-SiO2 and Au/3DOM-SiO2 were less active than their corresponding Au/MnOx/3DOM-SiO2 where the conversion of 90% was reached at 255 °C when GHSV and toluene concentration were 20,000 mL•g -1 •h -1 and 1000ppm respectively (Yang et al. 2015a).</p>
        <p>Similarly, among the three prepared catalysts (Au/3DOM La0.6Sr0.4MnO3, MnOx/3DOM La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 and Au/MnOx/3DOM La0.6Sr0.4MnO3) under the same reaction conditions (GHSV of 20,000 mL•g -1 •h -1 and toluene concentration of 1000ppm), Au/MnOx/3DOM La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 nanocatalyst showed the highest activity for total toluene oxidation (T50 = 205 °C and T90 = 220 °C) due to its larger surface area, high concentration of adsorbed oxygen, and powerful interaction of Au nanoparticles or Manganese oxides and 3DOM LSMO (Jiang et al. 2015). A gold-based catalyst supported on mesoporous ferrisilicates (MFS) was also synthesized for total oxidation of toluene and the results showed that the complete toluene oxidation achieved at 374 °C, and the catalytic activity of the catalyst increased with the iron content (Benais-Hamidi et al. 2015).</p>
        <p>A literature search showed the absence of coke formation as a byproduct of incomplete combustion of toluene. However, the reported works on the utilization of Au catalysts at a lower temperature are still scarce. Therefore, more studies are required to find out the potential of Aubased-catalyst that can help the oxidation of toluene at a lower temperature. Furthermore, other research can focus on other dopants that can help Au to create more surface-active oxygen on the catalyst to increase its activity at a lower reaction temperature.</p>
        <p>Pd catalysts are used for the oxidation of toluene and exhibit high thermal and hydrothermal resistance compared to the rest of the noble metals-based catalysts (Huang et al. 2008). Pd catalysts supported on different supports like metal oxides and porous silica have been shown to have high activity for this kind of reaction. Their highest performance has been attributed to a dual role of Pd where Pd metal sites are active for the degradation of toluene and PdO supplies an extra source of oxygen on the surface. Besides, Pd supported catalysts are more stable than Pt-supported catalysts for toluene degradation (Liu et al. 2013).</p>
        <p>Porous silica has been reported as good support of Pd nanoparticles and ZSM-5 was found to be stable and coke-resistant for Pd supported catalysts. In this case, the dispersion of Pd and redox potential can be influenced by the acidity of support (He et al. 2012a). The quantitative moles of the acid sites, corresponding to the amounts of adsorbed ammonia measured by NH3-TPD, were positively correlated with the improved dispersion and accelerated oxidation of Pd, both of which had the cumulative effects on toluene oxidation. The importance of acidic sites of zeolite was to anchor the dispersed form of PdO (He et al. 2014). It was found that the main role of zeolite's protons is to maintain Pd 2+ formed through the reaction between PdO particles and zeolite protons to form Pd 2+ cations (PdO + 2H + → Pd 2+ + H2O) (Okumura et al. 2000). To understand the effect of acidity on the catalytic performance of the catalysts, the catalyst's acidic properties were explored and it was found that the increase of acidity on the surfaces of the catalyst facilitates the oxidation of toluene (Hou et al. 2019). To explain this, possible pathways for the degradation of toluene were investigated and showed the adsorption of toluene to take place first, followed by its oxidation to benzaldehyde, benzoic acid then undergoes the formation of small molecules (carbonates and carboxylates) and end up with CO2 and H2O production (Rui et al. 2017). Since carbonates and these intermediates are acidic, it is hard for them to be adsorbed on the catalyst's acidic surfaces. It is very easy for these formed intermediates to be desorbed from the surfaces of the catalyst and this facilitates the positive improvement of the oxidation reaction of toluene (Hou et al. 2019). For mesoporous materials like MCM-48, KIT-6, and SBA-15, pore size distribution is narrow with high specific surface area, and Pd aggregation was found to be at a low rate compared to other supports (Bendahou et al. 2008;Wang et al. 2008). The preparation method can also affect the dispersion of Pd on its support. Various preparation techniques such as impregnation and grafting techniques were investigated in order to understand the impact of the preparation method on Pd dispersion during the synthesis of Pd supported on SBA-15. The grafting technique was found to help in the formation of well-dispersed Pd particles on SBA-15 (He et al. 2010). The solvent utilized in the synthesis was also found to exhibit a significant effect on the dispersion of Pd. To understand the impact of various solvents on Pd dispersion on its support different solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, water, dimethyl sulphoxide, ethanol, and tetrahydrofuran were investigated and the highest dispersion was shown on the catalyst synthesized by the use of N,Ndimethylformamide (He et al. 2010). Another synthesis approach was reported to use two solvents where they combine hydrophilic solvent like water and hydrophobic solvent like hexane. By using this technique, SBA-15 supported Pd catalyst was prepared and the acid sites on the catalyst showed advantages to the dispersion of Pd. Besides, the prepared catalyst was found to possess good thermal stability and excellent tolerance to moisture. Of the tested catalyst prepared in this way, the best one was observed to convert toluene totally at 210 °C with GHSV of 32,000 h -1 (He et al. 2012b).</p>
        <p>Compared to the activity of Pd catalysts having a single type of pores on the support, Silica materials bearing two different kinds of pores, such as micro-and mesopores were found to favor the highest activity of the Pd catalyst when used as support. For instance, total toluene conversion was achieved at 200 °C when silica material holding up both meso-and micropores was used as support of the Pd catalyst. That reaction temperature was lower than that of catalysts having a single type of pores (He et al. 2012c). Okumura et al. 2003 studied how Pd catalysts' catalytic activity can be affected by the acid-base property of metal oxide support and found that the electronic interaction between supports and Pd particles had an outstanding effect on the catalytic performance of the catalyst.</p>
        <p>The highest performance of Pd supported on bimodal mesoporous silica for toluene degradation was investigated and Pd/BMS-15 was found to exhibit high catalytic activity towards toluene oxidation compared to Pd/MCM-48 and Pd/MCM-41 catalysts. Besides, the prepared catalyst (Pd/BMS-15) also showed improvement in hydrothermal stability at high GHSV (70,000 h -1 ) for 1000ppm of toluene concentration (Qiao et al. 2015). The support effect over Pd supported catalysts for toluene oxidation was studied where three different supports, including SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and TiO2 were used for the investigation of the effect of support on the performance and properties of Pd supported catalyst. The investigation was conducted for 1000ppm of toluene concentration and 28,000 h -1 of GHSV. The results showed the following order in catalytic performance: 1wt%Pd/TiO2 &gt;1wt%Pd/SiO2 &gt;1wt%Pd/γ-Al2O3 corresponds to T90 = 208°C &lt; T90 = 224°C &lt; T90 = 240°C. The size of particles and the concentration of palladium on the surface of the support were found to be affected by the strong interaction of support and palladium. The Pd/TiO2 catalyst's excellent activity was attributed to the large size of the particles and the highest concentration of palladium on the surface of the support (Kim et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>The importance of basic sites with mechanistic studies of Pd-based catalyst supported on modified-Al2O3 towards complete oxidation of toluene was studied. In that study, three different metal oxides of Ba, Zr, and Mg were used for modifying Al2O3 support for Pd catalysts under the reaction conditions of 500ppm toluene and 24,000 mL/g.h of GHSV. The results showed that the Pd/Al2O3 performance was catalytically promoted in the following order: Pd/MgO-Al2O3 &gt; Pd/BaO-Al2O3 &gt; Pd/ZrO2-Al2O3 &gt; Pd/Al2O3. The highest catalytic activity (T50 = 185°C and T90 = 209°C) of Pd/MgO-Al2O3 was due to PdO dispersion caused by its decrease in size (from 4.3 nm to 2.2 nm) observed after doping with MgO, which makes much Pd 2+ to be present in the catalyst (Weng et al. 2019). The preparation technique effect on the activity and surface features of the OMS-2 supported Pd catalysts was also investigated where three different preparation methods including deposition-precipitation (DP), pre-incorporation (PI), and ion-exchanging (EX) were used to prepare Pd/OMS-2-DP, Pd/OMS-2-PI, and Pd/OMS-2-EX respectively with the same metal loading of 0.5wt%, and the results showed that Pd/OMS-2-DP indicated excellent catalytic performance compared to others where T50 = 240°C and T90 = 285°C. The highest catalytic activity was due to the highest acidity, Pd loading surface, concentration of adsorbed oxygen, and higher oxygen mobility (Liu et al. 2017). Zhao and Dong (2018) used SiH4 to increase the stability of Pd/Al2O3 in the aqueous oxidation reaction of toluene. In their work, they successfully prepared Si-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts using SiH4 treatment, and the stability of prepared catalysts were significantly improved. From the reviewed literature, it can be noted that there are few reports about the impact of active phase's oxidation state on the catalytic performance. Thus, further studies can focus on the regulation of oxidation state of catalysts to develop more active Pd catalysts for low-temperature toluene oxidation.</p>
        <p>Like other noble metals, Ag-based catalysts have been used for oxidizing toluene. From the reported literature, there are few reports about silver catalysts towards toluene oxidation. However, Ag-based catalysts perform well for catalytic oxidation of toluene where it can achieve toluene conversion of 93% at a low reaction temperature of 62 °C (Zhu et al. 2018b). Silver catalysts supported on modified ceria for toluene removal at 40,000 h-1 of GHSV and 1000ppm of toluene concentration were investigated. It was observed that the silver-based catalyst supported on Mn2O3 with 0 to 2.1 of Ag loading range, 0.06 wt%Ag/Mn2O3 showed high activity yet poor stability for the oxidation of toluene; however, after the addition of CeO2, the catalyst exhibited very good catalytic stability which was due to timely refilling of the surface reactive lattice oxygen molecules (Zhang et al. 2019b). This shows that the addition of transition metal oxide to supported Ag catalyst could influence the performance of the catalyst for this reaction. Qin et al. 2017 used three different conditions for pretreatment such as O2 at 500 °C, H2 at 500 °C, and O2 at 500 °C followed by H2 at 300 °C to study their effect on the catalytic performance of SBA-15 supported silver catalysts (Ag/SBA-15) for the oxidation of 1000ppm toluene over GHSV of 37500 h -1 . Their results showed that big Ag particles were formed at the surface of the support by the pretreatment under H2 at 500 °C. After the pretreatment for O2 at 500 °C, both Ag2O and Ag were formed, but the treatment of H2 at 300 °C followed by pretreatment under O2 at 500 °C leads to Ag2O reduction and re-dispersion of Ag, resulting in the formation of smaller particles of Ag. Thus, it can be concluded that various pretreatment conditions could highly affect silver-based catalysts' structure, which in turn affects their adsorption capacity and catalytic performance for toluene combustion. The effects of support structures on the interaction between OMS-2 support and Ag and the catalytic activity were investigated, and the results revealed that the loaded Ag exercised crucial influence on catalyst physicochemical properties, and the catalytic activity was highly improved (Fu et al. 2018). It should be noted that few works on Ag-based catalysts for toluene oxidation were reported; thus further research on their application for toluene oxidation is required.</p>
        <p>It has been found that supported noble metals alloy performs well for toluene oxidation compared to supported single noble metals. Thus, some kinds of literature show that the catalytic performance of noble metal-based catalysts could be furtherly increased by the addition of a second noble metal (Fu et al. 2016). Au-Pd/3DOM Co3O4 for catalytic oxidation of toluene was studied.</p>
        <p>In that study, gold-palladium alloy with a mass ratio of Au:Pd = 1:1 was supported on 3DOM Co3O4 to make nanocatalysts, which achieved better performance than the supported single metals (Pd or Au) catalyst. Of the tested catalysts, 1.99wt% AuPd/3DOM Co3O4 showed excellent performance for catalytic toluene degradation where the temperatures to achieve 10%, 50%, and 90% conversion of toluene were 145, 164, and 168 °C at 40,000 mL•g -1 •h -1 of space velocity, respectively. In comparison with supported single metal (Au or Pd) catalyst, the prepared nanocatalysts of 3DOM Co3O4 supported with Au-Pd showed good catalytic stability and higher tolerance of moisture for the oxidation of toluene. Besides, the apparent activation energies of xAuPd/3DOM Co3O4 (33-41 kJ mol -1 ) was encountered to be less than the one of single Au or Pd supported on 3DOM Co3O4 (52-112 kJ/mol), and it was concluded that the highest activity of 1.99wt% AuPd/3DOM Co3O4 was related to the ability of oxygen activation and strong interaction of the noble metal with 3DOM Co3O4 (Xie et al. 2015a).</p>
        <p>Pt-Pd bimetallic synthesis immobilized on MCM-41 mesoporous materials (Pt-Pd/MCM-41) with super catalytic activity for toluene degradation was also investigated. The results revealed that the prepared Pt-Pd/MCM-41 catalyst exhibited higher catalytic performance in comparison with single Pt metal immobilized on MCM-41 (Pt/MCM-41) or Pd supported on MCM-41 (Pd/MCM-41) with the same amount of the metal of 0.3wt%. The total oxidation of toluene was reached at 180 °C for 0.2Pt-0.1Pd/MCM-41 under 10,000 h -1 of GHSV and 500ppm toluene. It was also shown that the bimetal catalyst held large surface content of Pt (0) and a small size of doped metal owing to the synergistic effect between the two noble metals, which resulted in reducibility improvement and high capacity of adsorbing oxygen (Fu et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>From Table 2, it is easily seen that the combination of gold (Au) and palladium (Pd) supported on different supports is the one that is mostly used for toluene oxidation. Meanwhile, some of the noble metals can be combined with other metals to increase their catalytic activity. For instance, the combination of Au-Co supported on SBA-15 for catalytic degradation of toluene was investigated and it was found that the prepared catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity for toluene combustion where total degradation of toluene was reached at the reaction temperature of 300 o C.</p>
        <p>It indicated that mesoporous materials provide extensive surface area support, and gold particles get active supports from cobalt. Such a bimetallic catalyst helps overcome the deficiency of specific surface area for reducible transition metal oxides (Wu et al. 2015). Similarly, Pt immobilized on highly-dispersed ceria and activated carbon for complete VOCs degradation was also investigated and platinum was promoted by ceria and high dispersion was achieved on activated carbon as support. The prepared catalyst showed better performance for toluene oxidation compared to platinum supported on bulk ceria due to the optimum synergistic energy between high dispersion of ceria with particles of platinum (Abdelouahab-reddam et al. 2015). The higher performance of platinum-supported catalysts could be attributed to the better Pt dispersion on supports (Rui et al. 2017). Hou et al. 2019 studied the tungsten effect for enhancing the catalytic activity of monolith Pt/Ce0.65Zr0.35O2 catalysts for toluene decomposition. Their study found a decrease of 30 °C in the temperature for complete combustion of toluene using the monolith Pt-WO3/Ce0.65Zr0.35O2 catalyst as compared to its counterpart without tungsten. The superior catalytic performance of Pt-WO3/Ce0.65Zr0.35O2 was attributed to its excellent low-temperature reducibility, greater surface for adsorbing high concentration of oxygen, and higher strength of the acidic medium. Supports like silica materials were investigated to support bimetallic catalysts for deep degradation of toluene (Fu et al. 2016). For example, SiO2 supported Pd-Pt catalyst for toluene combustion was studied and it was determined that during the reaction, the prepared catalyst (0.25%Pd-0.25%Pt/SiO2) had very limited coking and high activity for the reaction under reaction conditions of 60,000 mL/g.h GHSV and 1000ppm toluene. That catalyst's performance was determined to be ameliorated by the addition of oleic acid to the solution of metal salt during the preparation of the catalyst, which was associated with the enhancement of Pd metal in the formed catalyst (Wang et al. 2017a).</p>
        <p>The recent industrial application needs catalysts with outstanding catalytic performance, economy, and simple to design. Nowadays, it is still a pressing challenge to synthesize such catalysts. It seems that the fabrication of a catalyst based on the co-doping of noble metals and transition metals can be a solution owing to the high activity of noble metals, and the availability and low cost of transition metals. Thus, it is recommended to explore the noble metals' fusion with transition metals to develop cost-effective catalysts operational at low temperatures as it is noted that no much research has been done on the combination of noble metals and transition metals.</p>
        <p>Further work can focus on the effect of the second metal on the creation of active surface oxygen of the catalyst. Other work can focus on dominant metals that can provide the maximum active sites during the catalyst preparation based on the combination of noble and transition metals. A deep study on the structure-activity relationship and synergistic effect of noble-transition metal catalyst is also needed as it can be more beneficial for clearing some doubt like how various structures and morphologies get formed which may result in different catalytic activities.</p>
        <p>As stated earlier, noble metal-based catalysts have been commercially widely utilized in catalytic oxidation of toluene due to their highest activity compared to other metals. However, they are limited by their high cost and high metal load (Aboukaïs et al. 2016;Yang, Deng et al. 2016;Zhao et al. 2019a). To increase their catalytic performance with lower metal loading, various techniques to reduce the metal size in the nanometer scale like nanoparticles resulted in improving the active surface areas, and mixing of noble metals with non-noble metals (Wu et al. 2015;Torrentemurciano et al. 2017) or other noble metals (Xie et al. 2015b;Fu et al. 2016;Barakat et al. 2018) have also attracted serious research attention. Core-shell structured catalysts have shown to be one of the promising techniques to increase the catalyst activity and diminish its cost. Particularly, core-shell structured catalysts based on two metals, like Ag@Pd and Au@ Pd, can optimize the use of Pd metal in the shell and help in the cost reduction of the catalyst. It can also help catalytic activity improvement through electronic alteration and reduced metal segregation of bimetallic structures (Chen et al. 2016;Abdel-Fattah et al. 2017;Kang et al. 2018).</p>
        <p>Bimetallic core-shell based catalysts have exhibited high catalytic performance towards toluene oxidation with lower metal loading. For instance, TiO2 supported the core-shell structure of Ag and Pd bimetallic based catalyst for toluene oxidation was reported, and it was found that the prepared catalyst of Ag@Pd/TiO2 exhibited higher catalytic activity for toluene oxidation in comparison with monometallic Pd/TiO2 catalyst with Pd loading 25% wt (Li et al. 2018). Figure 2 shows the preparation technique of Ag@Pd supported on TiO2. Today, studies on Ag@M (M=Pt, Pd, Ru) core-shell catalysts have been conducted for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cell cathodes and production of hydrogen from the decomposition of formic acid (Wang et al. 2015). However, the reports about the utilization of those catalysts in the oxidation of toluene are still very few. Thus, more research about their activity on toluene oxidation might be worthy of being explored.</p>
        <p>Current studies are focusing on the innovation of cheap catalysts with high catalytic performance at low temperatures. Generally, transition metals are less expensive as compared to noble metals.</p>
        <p>They are also abundant in nature and more resistant to poisons, but they usually have lower catalytic activity as compared to noble metal-based catalysts (Du et al. 2018;Feng et al 2018). The most useful and effective transition metals for toluene oxidation are Mn, Co, and Ce, and other metals like Fe, Cu, Ni, and Cr are not as effective as Mn, Co and Ce based on the experimental results. Transition metals can be used as single metal-based catalysts with or without support (Li et al. 2016a;Rokici et al. 2016;Wei et al. 2017;Xie et al. 2018;Ren et al. 2019;Zhu et al. 2019a).</p>
        <p>The supported transition metal-based catalysts have been shown to have higher catalytic activity compared to unsupported catalysts (Li et al. 2016). To increase the catalytic activity of transition metal-based catalysts, two (Georgescu and Bombos 2016;Du et al. 2018;Jiang and Xu 2019;Zhang et al. 2019c) or three (Dou et al. 2019) transition metals can be mixed to make one catalyst with high performance. Tables 3 and4 summarize reported single and mixed transition metalbased catalysts, respectively. From Table 3, it is easily seen that Mn and Co-based catalysts are mostly used as single metal-based catalysts for catalytic oxidation of toluene. Table 4 shows that</p>
        <p>Mn is mostly mixed with other metals to make the bimetallic or trimetallic-based catalysts. Up to now, the catalytic activity of single transition metal-based catalysts is still low compared to noble metal-based catalysts; however, mixed transition metal-based catalysts can achieve comparable catalytic performance to noble metal-based catalysts.</p>
        <p>As described earlier, transition metals can be used as single metal-based catalysts and have been shown to perform well for catalytic oxidation of toluene (Wook et al. 2016;Qin et al. 2018). The The preparation method of a transition metal-based catalyst can be another factor affecting its catalytic performance (Lin et al. 2018). It can also be affected by transition metal concentration on the support (Rokici et al. 2017) as well as the morphology of the catalysts (Ren et al. 2018).</p>
        <p>It has been reported that mixed metal oxide catalysts exhibit better catalytic performance compared to single metal oxides. For example, two different single oxides (CeO2, Co3O4) were combined to study their synergistic effect on catalytic oxidation of toluene, and it was found that CeO2-CoOx exhibited outstanding catalytic activity compared to pure CeO2 and Co3O4 (Zhang et al. 2019d). Dou et al. (2019) used environmentally friendly bacterial cellulose to synthesize CuO-CeO2-ZrO2</p>
        <p>catalyst by a modified sol-gel method. The prepared catalyst exhibited excellent stability and catalytic activity towards toluene oxidation where the total toluene conversion was reached at 220 °C for 1500ppm toluene and 24,000 h -1 of GHSV. Their highest activity was ascribed to the presence of many oxygen vacancies, a strong synergistic effect between metal-oxides, and hierarchical porous structure.</p>
        <p>A modified hydrothermal method was used to synthesize Mn-Ce oxide catalysts for lowtemperature toluene degradation and it was shown that the manganese-cerium ratio played an essential role in catalysts preparation, textual properties, and catalytic performance. The creation of Mn-Ce solid solution distinctly increases the surface area and pore volume of the catalyst.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, it has been found that Ce in Mn-Ce oxide played a key function in toluene adsorption, but Mn was found to be important in toluene oxidation; hence the synergy of Mn and Ce ameliorates the process of the catalytic reaction (Du et al. 2018).</p>
        <p>The activity of mixed metal oxide catalysts could depend on the preparation method (Genty et al. 2015) and the concentration of one of the mixed metals. Different CeaMnOx catalysts were synthesized for investigating the Ce concentration effect on the catalyst performance towards toluene oxidation under 20,000 mL/g•h of GHSV and 1000ppm of toluene. The results showed that the performance order was Ce0.03MnOx &gt; Ce0.02MnOx &gt; Ce0.04MnOx &gt; Ce0.05MnOx &gt; MnOx.</p>
        <p>Among the tested catalysts, Ce0.03MnOx showed the highest performance (T50 = 215°C and T90 = 225°C which are lower than those of MnOx), stability, and high resistance to H2O owing to abundant oxygen molecules on the surface and species of Mn 4+ (Zhao et al. 2019b).</p>
        <p>Perovskite catalysts belong to non-noble metal-based catalysts with ABO3 as a formula in general, where A represents rare earth or alkaline earth ion, B represents transition metal ions (Figure 1).</p>
        <p>Other metal ions with similar radius can partly replace A and B so that their crystal structure remains unchanged (Zang et al. 2019). Perovskites based catalysts have been found to achieve excellent catalytic performance similar to noble metal-based catalysts, but their very low surface area limits their practical applications in catalytic combustion. Both intrinsic elements like surface area, surface oxygen imperfection, A/B site, crystal structure, and extrinsic conditions such as preparation techniques are known to significantly affect the catalytic activity of perovskite oxides type of catalysts. The preparation methods are known to be correlated with the low surface area, especially for the long-time reaction at high temperatures (Tomatis et al. 2016). Thus, it has been reported that the increase of their surface area can be achieved by improving the preparation methods, decreasing synthesis temperature, and applying supports of a high surface area (Li et al. 2009;Tomatis et al. 2016). The effect of synthesis method on the catalytic performance of perovskite-type catalysts towards toluene oxidation was studied through synthesizing highly active SmMnO3 Perovskites by using four different preparation methods, including impregnation, sol-gel, co-precipitation, and self-molten-polymerization techniques (Liu et al. 2019a). The experimental results showed that the perovskite synthesized by the self-molten-polymerization method exhibited the best catalytic capacity compared to others. The highest catalytic activity of that catalyst could be ascribed to its high concentration of adsorbed oxygen species, high surface ratio of Mn 4+ /Mn 3+ (0.95) and lower temperature reducibility. That catalyst showed long-term stability towards toluene oxidation by maintaining the conversion of toluene &gt;99.9% at 270 °C for 42 hours. Its oxidation reaction depended on the synergistic effect between adsorbed oxygen, lattice oxygen, and oxygen vacancies.</p>
        <p>The in-situ DRIFTs results indicated that the lattice oxygen on the surface of catalyst could undergo electron transfers and form adsorbed oxygen species due to the activation by oxygen vacancies (Liu et al. 2019a).</p>
        <p>Meng et al. 2016 selected Lan+1NinO3n+1 layered type of perovskite as a powerful catalyst for toluene degradation to study the behavior of active oxygen species involved in the catalytic activity.</p>
        <p>Their results demonstrated the order in toluene catalytic degradation of LaNiO3 &gt; La4Ni3O10 &gt; La2NiO4 with 90% conversion of toluene at 250, 310, and 350 °C, respectively. This shows the impact of transition metal parts on perovskite catalytic performance.</p>
        <p>The effect of some metals on perovskite-type oxides' catalytic activity with a formula of LaMn1-xBxO3 (B=Cu, Fe and x=0, 0.3, 0.7), and La0.8A0.2Mn0.3B0.7O3 (A=Sr, Ce and B=Cu, Fe)</p>
        <p>was investigated and the experimental results revealed that Fe-based perovskite-type of catalysts showed better catalytic performance than Cu-based perovskite-type of catalysts when subjected to 1000ppm with GHSV of 6000 h -1 . The replacement of Sr and Ce in the A-site place of the catalysts increased their catalytic activity for toluene oxidation, and the highest activity was shown by La0.8Ce0.2Mn0.3Fe0.7O3 where T50 and T100 were 179 °C and 202 °C respectively (Tarjomannejad et al. 2016). Sr 2+ and Fe 3+ -doped LaMnO3 perovskites catalysts (La0.9Sr0.1Mn0.9Fe0.1O3) have been synthesized, and that catalyst showed the highest performance comparable to many noble metal catalysts in toluene catalytic oxidation, due to the presence of enriched surface oxygen vacancies and mobile lattice oxygen (Weng et al. 2018).</p>
        <p>The catalytic activity of perovskite-type catalysts can be increased by doping different transition metals like Mn, Cu, and Fe (Meng et al. 2016;Suárez-vázquez et al. 2018). The performance of perovskite catalyst can also depend on the treatment method; for example, Yang et al. (2018) found that LaCoO3 perovskite catalyst treated with acetic acid exhibited high catalytic performance compared to untreated LaCO3 where a decrease of 40 °C of the required temperature to convert 90% of toluene, was observed. It has been found that double-type perovskite catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity for toluene oxidation than single perovskite catalysts (Pan and Chang 2019).</p>
        <p>The synthesis steps' effect on the catalytic performance of LaBO3 (B: Mn, Fe) towards toluene degradation was reported, where three successive synthesis steps, such as solid-state synthesis (SSR), high-energy ball milling (HEBM), and low-energy ball milling (LEBM) in wet conditions, were investigated. The results revealed that the catalytic performance for toluene oxidation rises at each step, and the performance order was found to be SSR &lt; HEBM &lt; LEBM (Heidinger et al. 2019). The supported perovskite catalysts were reported to exhibit higher catalytic performance than the unsupported perovskite catalysts (Giroir-Fendler et al. 2016). Table 5 shows the summary of perovskites-based catalysts reported on catalytic oxidation of toluene, and from this table, it can be easily seen sol-gel method followed by calcination is the technique mostly used for the preparation of perovskite-type catalysts.</p>
        <p>The catalytic activity of perovskite can be tuned by changing its chemical composition because it can hold metal elements of around 90% with no destruction of the structure. Furthermore, the perovskite oxide's capacity for being stable at high temperatures enables them to be fitted for thermal oxidation (Chen et al. 2019a). Therefore, more efforts can be put into the advancement of perovskite catalysts with high performance, including control of morphology, dissolution selectivity, replacement of A and/or B sites as well as the combination with precious metals.</p>
        <p>Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown prominently as versatile precursors that can be applied to make functional MOF-derived materials for toluene catalytic oxidation. MOFs composed of inorganic metal nodes and rigid organic linkers have captivated much attention to make the metal oxides via the pyrolysis of organic linkers due to their adjustable, well-defined, and highly porous structures (Peedikakkal et al. 2017;Luo et al. 2018;Chen et al. 2019b;Sun et al. 2019c).</p>
        <p>MOF-based catalysts have been reported to have an excellent catalytic performance for toluene oxidation similar to noble metal-based catalysts where a single metal can be used to fabricate a functional MOF-based catalyst (Zhao et al. 2019d), but mixed metal oxide can achieve higher catalytic performance than a single one (Sun et al. 2019b).</p>
        <p>MnOx-CeO2-MOF and MnOx-MOF as derived catalysts from MOFs were investigated. In that study, MnOx-CeO2-CP by co-precipitation and MnOx-D by thermal decomposition of MnOOH were synthesized for comparison and tested for 1000ppm toluene and 60,000 mL/g.h of GHSV.</p>
        <p>The results showed that MOF-based catalysts (MnOx-CeO2-MOF and MnOx-MOF) exhibited higher catalytic performance towards the oxidation of toluene compared to MnOx-CeO2-CP and MnOx-D, and the order in catalytic performance was MnOx-CeO2-MOF &gt; MnOx-MOF &gt; MnOx-CeO2-CP &gt; MnOx-D (Sun et al. 2019b). The highest surface area and plentiful oxygen vacancies resulted from the integration of Ce into MnOx, and this resulted in excellent low-temperature reducibility and high oxygen mobility, which would induce high content of Mn 4+ on the surface leading to the excellent activity of the catalyst (Sun et al. 2019b).</p>
        <p>The MnOx/Cr2O3 mixed metal catalyst by pyrolysis of MIL-101-Cr precursor for toluene oxidation was investigated, and it was found that with the incorporation of MnOx into Cr2O3, the MnOx/Cr2O3-MOF showed the obviously increased catalytic performance for the oxidation of toluene in comparison with commercial Cr2O3 or pure Cr2O3 pyrolyzed by MIL-101-Cr (Chen et al. 2019b). The as-prepared composite catalyst showed good stability, and the toluene conversion could be remained at 85% for at least 240 hours without any catalyst deactivation. The better durability and tolerance of the prepared catalyst were probably attributed to good stability for crystal structure, oxygen vacancies, and reducibility (Chen et al. 2019b). Table 6 represents the summary of the reported MOF-based catalysts for toluene oxidation and their synthesis methods.</p>
        <p>Up to now, few articles have been reported on MOF-based catalysts, and only non-noble metal catalysts derived from the metal-organic framework have been investigated; however, it is possible to make noble metal-based catalysts derived from MOFs, and this can help to decrease the catalyst cost, which will be more economical for industrial application.</p>
        <p>Spinel-based catalysts are metal oxides with a composition of AB2O4 and possess a defect-rich structure (Tomatis et al. 2016). These catalysts have been reported to be less expensive and exhibit high catalytic activity towards toluene oxidation at low temperatures (Wang et al. 2018). As the synthesis method would affect the morphologies of the catalysts, it plays a crucial role in the preparation of the spinel catalysts with higher surface area and required crystal structure (Tomatis et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>A template-free autoclave technique was used to synthesize a 3D flower-like morphology Co2.25Mn0.75O4 spinel catalyst. The as-prepared catalyst has been found stable and exhibits good catalytic activity, and the total conversion of toluene was achieved at the reaction temperature of 239 °C, and no obvious change was found within 70 h of the reaction (Wang et al. 2018). The high activity with the stability of the prepared spinel catalyst on toluene oxidation was associated with its high surface area, porous structure, the interaction between Mn and Co, and rich surface oxygen vacancies. In situ DRIFTS results showed the probable reaction pathway for synthetic Mn-Co based catalyst, by which toluene was firstly dissociated to benzyl radical, benzaldehyde, benzene, oxalic acid, and finally converted to CO2 and H2O (Wang et al. 2018). Dong et al. (2019) synthesized nanoflower CoMn2O4 spinel catalyst using the oxalic acid solgel method to investigate its performance in the catalytic toluene oxidation for GHSV of 22,500 mL/g.h and 500ppm of toluene concentration, and they found that compared to other metal oxides like Co3O4, MnOx, and Co3O4/MnOx, the synthesized spinel catalyst showed lower activation energy of 35.5 kJ/mol, better catalytic performance (total conversion achieved at 220 °C), higher surface area, richer cationic vacancy, and larger oxygen species mobility. The stability test showed that the prepared spinel catalyst was very stable, and it was able to keep toluene conversion above 98% at 220 °C for about 700 min. Different types of oxygen species showed various roles in catalytic oxidation of toluene. Therefore, in situ designed-temperature programmed (TP) methods were used to study the participation of surface lattice oxygen, bulk lattice oxygen, and gaseous oxygen in catalytic toluene oxidation over CoMn2O4 spinel catalysts. More specifically, the gaseous oxygen moves to the bulk phase lattice and then migrates to the surface to form the surface lattice oxygen on CoMn2O4, the last of which deems to be the main active oxygen species in actual toluene oxidation reaction (Dong et al. 2019).</p>
        <p>A series of Mn3-xFexO4 defected spinels were synthesized by controlling the integration of Fe ions into the Mn3O4 crystal structure via self-polymerizable monomer adjustment of the molten Mn-Fe salt dispersion. It was found that Fe doping raised the defected lattices, oxygen vacancy concentration, specific surface area, mesoporosity, and catalytic properties compared to Cu ions doping (Liu et al. 2019b). Mn2.4Fe0.6O4 spinel catalyst showed the highest catalytic performance for toluene oxidation where 90% conversion achieved at 224 °C for GHSV of 60,000 mL/g.h and 1000ppm toluene and no change have been found within 120 h, which confirms its stability (Liu et al. 2019b).</p>
        <p>In summary, from the reported literature, spinel catalysts showed good catalytic activity towards toluene oxidation and, they have shown thermal stability and durability in the reported experimental conditions; however, few types of research have been conducted on their application in toluene catalytic degradation.</p>
        <p>The success of catalytic oxidation of toluene is attributed to numerous factors that include the reaction conditions and the activity of catalysts. The activity of the catalyst is mainly affected by various factors, including morphology and structure, preparation techniques, degree of crystallinity, surface reducibility, surface area, active components or sites, and stability (Zhang et al. 2019e). The combination of these factors is desirable for a highly active catalyst to achieve effective toluene degradation.</p>
        <p>The catalyst's morphology and structure play a crucial role in enhancing its catalytic performance.</p>
        <p>The catalyst structure can affect other properties like surface area, pore size, and the available active sites on the surface. The performance of manganese oxide catalysts with a square tunnel structure has been mainly influenced by the size of tunnels (Molina et al. 2017). Similarly, the active sites on the catalyst surface depend on the catalyst type. The shape effect of Pt/CeO2 on the toluene degradation was investigated where three different CeO2 shapes such as nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanocubes were used, and it was found that Pt/CeO2-rods samples exhibited the highest catalytic activity compared to others due to greatest reducibility and high oxygen vacancies concentration on the surface. The experimental results showed that the performance of the prepared catalysts depends on the morphology of the catalyst (Peng et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>Similarly, The CeO2 morphology effect on catalytic degradation of toluene was studied. In that study, three different morphologies of CeO2 catalysts (cube, hollow sphere (HS), and rod) were prepared. The prepared catalysts were investigated for catalytic oxidation of toluene, and their activities were compared. Of the tested catalysts, CeO2-HS showed better catalytic performance for toluene combustion compared to the rod and cube-shaped catalysts, which achieved 90% of toluene conversion at 207 °C. Better performance of CeO2-HS catalyst was ascribed to its high surface area and large oxygen vacancies, which are essential for catalytic degradation of toluene.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, CeO2-HS showed good stability of the catalyst, reusability, and higher water tolerance (Feng et al. 2019). As shown in Figure 3, the activity of CeO2 catalysts depends on the morphology of the catalyst.</p>
        <p>The morphology effect of Ag/MnO2 catalyst on catalytic degradation of toluene was also investigated. In that study, three morphologies (wire-, rod-and tube-like) of Ag/MnO2 catalyst were prepared and tested for toluene oxidation. The experimental results showed that the tested catalyst's catalytic performance depended on the its morphology, and the wire-like Ag/MnO2 exhibited higher catalytic activity towards toluene oxidation, which could achieve the complete toluene degradation at 220 °C. The highest performance of this catalyst was attributable to the strong interaction of Ag and MnO2, which led to the high dispersion of hemispherical shape Ag particles of small size, strong reducibility and formation of abundant active lattice oxygen (Li et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>Various methods of synthesizing catalysts, including precipitation, co-precipitation, facile sol-gel method (Peta et al. 2018), hydrothermal methods, and micro-emulsion processes (Zhang et al. 2019f), are currently in use. Recently, researches have mostly focused on the improvement and modification of catalyst preparation techniques to increase their activity and catalytic performance (García et al. 2019;Peng et al. 2019;Wu et al. 2019b). Synthesis techniques and reaction conditions can be able to customize catalysts' textural properties, structures, and morphologies to influence their activity in oxidation reactions (He and Balasubramanian 2008;Okumura et al. 2003;Wang et al. 2008).</p>
        <p>The grafting technique as one of the preparation methods used for preparing catalysts was found to help in the evolution of well-dispersed Pd particles on SBA-15 (He et al. 2010). The solvent utilized in the synthesis was also found to exhibit a significant influence on Pd's dispersion, where the highest dispersion was shown by the use of N,N-dimethylformamide (He et al. 2010). Other techniques for synthesis were reported to use an approach of two solvents where they combine hydrophilic solvent like water and hydrophobic solvent like hexane. Using this technique, the SBA-15 supported Pd catalyst was prepared, and the acid sites on the catalyst were determined to be related to Pd dispersion. Besides, the prepared catalyst was found to possess good thermal stability and excellent tolerance to moisture. Of the tested catalyst prepared in this way, the best one was shown to convert toluene totally at 210 °C with GHSV of 32000 h -1 (Yu et al. 2019;He et al. 2012b).</p>
        <p>MnOx-CP by co-precipitation and MnOx-D by thermal decomposition of MnOOH were synthesized for comparison (Sun et al. 2019a). The experimental results showed that MnOx-CP exhibited higher catalytic activity towards toluene degradation as compared to MnOx-D. The XPS and H2-TPR shows that the relative percentage of Mn 4+ and low-temperature reducibility of MnOx-CP were higher than those of MnOx-D, respectively. All these demonstrate that the synthesis method might affect the interaction of MnOx and support through electron transfer, which would impact the catalytic activity of those catalysts. The influence of various synthesis techniques on the textural properties of calcium tungstate (CaWO4) and its catalytic properties in the toluene degradation was investigated where CaWO4 crystals were synthesized by microwaveassisted hydrothermal (MAH) and polymeric precursor methods (PPM). The experimental results showed that CaWO4 synthesized by MAH, compared to CaWO4 sample synthesized by PPM, have higher oxygen mobility that appears to be a key factor for excellent catalytic activities (Alencar et al. 2018).</p>
        <p>The surface area of catalysts is an important morphological parameter affecting the catalytic oxidation of toluene. Catalysts with a high surface area tend to exhibit better removal efficiencies. Liu et al. 2018 investigated specific surface area impact on SnO2 texture bulk and surface properties with their effect on catalytic performance towards toluene degradation. Experimental results demonstrated that a catalyst's textural properties such as pore volume and surface area greatly affect its catalytic oxidation performance for toluene. It was shown that the adsorption capacity and surface-active oxygen amount increase with the enhancement of the surface area, which significantly increases the catalytic performance. To further study the effect of surface area, five were prepared, for which the last number shows the surface area of each in m 2 /g. From Figure 4A, it is shown that the performance enhances in the following order: SnO2-2 &lt; SnO2-50 &lt; SnO2-91 &lt; SnO2-150 &lt; SnO2-217. This shows that the higher the surface area, the higher the catalyst activity, which implies that the catalyst's surface area could play an important role in the reaction activity of toluene combustion (Liu et al. 2018;Yusuf et al. 2020). To understand the surface area impact on inherent performance, Arrhenius plots were collected, as shown in Figure 4B. From Figure 4C, it is observed that both Rs (reaction rate normalized by catalyst weight) and Rw (reaction rate normalized by catalyst surface area) improved with the increase of surface area. In addition, the impact of surface area on the catalyst activity was particularly discussed by Ren et al. (2018)</p>
        <p>The medium RH has a significant effect on the efficiency of toluene oxidation, but high RH influences water molecules to compete with toluene on the active sites of the catalyst. This diminishes the catalyst activity by blocking the active surface of the catalyst. Fang et al. (2009) reported a comparative study that the T90 under 90% RH increased by 6.4 -15 % than the dry air atmosphere for toluene degradation. Hydrophobic supports have been found to have the advantage of avoiding the adsorption of moisture on the catalyst surface (Wu and Chang 1998). Thus, the catalyst's active site could not be blocked, and the activity of the catalyst would be maintained.</p>
        <p>Wu and Chang 1998 demonstrated that the higher hydrophobicity of the support, the lower the temperature required for the complete conversion of toluene. To understand this, they prepared three different catalysts with different hydrophobic supports and found out that the one with high hydrophobicity showed the complete degradation of toluene at 150 °C while the other two with less hydrophobicity achieved the completion oxidation at 180-200 °C. They also proposed that the oxidation rate of toluene could be increased by the elimination of formed water from the reaction system (Wu and Chang 1998). On the contrary, water vapor was found to help in the catalyst's activity recovery by enabling the desorption of carbonates from the active surface of the catalyst via the adsorption competition (Wang et al. 2015). Zhu and Andersson (1989) investigated the effect of H2O vapor on toluene oxidation over V2O5 and concluded that the addition of water of the appropriate amount enhanced the catalyst performance for toluene oxidation and selectivity of benzoic acid. Similarly, Ma et al. (2016) confirmed that toluene conversion and highest benzaldehyde yield could be increased by H2O added to the feed, and this phenomenon could be attributed to the effect of H2O adsorption on the catalyst surface that can behave as a hole trap forming surface adsorbed hydroxyl radicals and suppress the electron-hole recombination so as to enhance the catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants (Yusuf et al.2020). Different catalysts possess various physiochemical properties and catalytic activities, hence it is worth of investigating how the water vapor may promote the catalytic performance when designing the catalysts to be used.</p>
        <p>The formation of coke (carbon compounds) is frequently observed during the oxidation of VOCs. These compounds were found to lower the catalyst activity and block the active catalyst site when deposited on the pores and surface of the catalyst. The formation of coke and its removal for catalytic oxidation of toluene on CuNaHY zeolites was investigated (Antunes et al. 2001). In this study, the total burning of coke at 1020 o C using pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to determine the amount and characterize the composition and distribution of coke molecules deposited on the catalyst within 6 h after start of reaction. It was observed that the percentage of deposited coke started to rise with reaction temperature (150-250 °C) and then quickly decreased when the reaction temperature increased further as shown in The temperature effect on the formation of coke was also described in the oxidation of o-xylene over Pd/HY (Magnoux and Guisnet 1999). It was observed that when the reactant oxidation is very fast, the formed coke becomes low. From the experimental observation, the amount of coke retained on the catalyst might also depend on the acidity of the support as the presence of acidic sites might influence the dispersion of active elements (Dégé et al. 2000). The formation of coke was widely reported on zeolites, and various methods were specifically designed to quantify and characterize coke formation on these materials (Beauchet et al. 2007;Pinard et al. 2013). Coke formation could be avoided by enhancing the operating temperature above 290 °C, and the deactivated catalysts could be regenerated by increasing the temperature to destroy the retained coke (Magnoux and Guisnet 1999).</p>
        <p>Halogen-containing compounds are utilized as essential precursors, agents for controlling the morphology (Tanada et al. 1999), and raw materials for making various catalysts, especially noble metal catalysts (Xu et al. 2015b). However, different noble metal catalysts such as Pt catalysts have been found to be deactivated by halogenated compounds like Cl and F containing compounds where these anions block Pt active sites (Gracia et al. 2002;Nie et al. 2014). As described in section 2, noble metal catalysts have shown good catalytic activity towards the oxidation of toluene, and Pt catalysts exhibit better catalytic performance than others. Nevertheless, Pt active sites in the catalysts are easily deactivated by halogens. Gracia et al. 2002 investigated the chlorine effect on Pt catalysts for oxidation reaction and revealed that the presence of chlorine seriously affected the catalyst activity where the catalyst with chlorine was ten times less active than the catalyst without chlorine. Nie et al. 2014 also showed that the adsorbed F -ions on the Pt catalyst surface decrease the catalyst performance and may lead to total deactivation. Halogens such as F, Cl, Br, and I in halogen-containing VOCs deactivate the catalysts during their catalytic oxidation or when they are mixed with other VOCs like toluene (Deng et al. 2020;Lv et al. 2020). Zhu et al. 2016 studied the effect of halogen poisoning on Pt-TiO2. In their work, Pt catalysts supported on TiO2 were prepared with or without halogens like Cl -, F -, Br -and I -ions.</p>
        <p>Experimental results showed that the activity of halogen-free catalysts was much higher than the activity of halogen-containing catalysts. By comparing the catalytic activity of halogen-containing catalysts, the results showed their activity in the following order: F-Pt &gt; Cl-Pt &gt; Br-Pt &gt; I-Pt. The strong halogen adsorption on the Pt nanoparticle surface was the cause of poisoning (Zhu et al. 2016). The mechanism for halogen poisoning showed that the coordination bonds are formed between the adsorbed halogen ions and atoms of Pt by electron transfer into unoccupied 5d orbit of Pt atom, then inhibiting the adsorption of oxygen and lead to the catalyst inactivation (Zhu et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>Halogen poisoning does not affect metal catalysts at the same level. For instance, Cao et al. 2018 studied the deactivation mechanism of Pd-, Pt-and Ru-TiO2 catalysts for dichloromethane oxidation. Their results showed that Pt/TiO2 had lower performance and was easily get poisoned, while Ru/TiO2 showed high resistance for chlorine poisoning. Compared to noble metals catalysts, transition metal catalysts are resistant to halogen poisoning (Yang et al. 2015b;Yang et al. 2019b).</p>
        <p>The resistance of transition metal catalysts to poison may occur due to their higher active surface area (Spivey 1987). Zhao et al. 2020 showed that zeolites such as ZSM-5 and BEA are resistant to the adsorption of chlorine due to their large surface area. Huang et al. (2015) reported CeO2-based catalysts for Chloro-aromatics degradation and found that CeO2 catalyst's stability was highly dependent on the Deacon activity where species of chlorine could be eliminated as Cl2.</p>
        <p>A kinetic model is an important tool for the simulation of toluene combustion/oxidation and the evaluation of toluene degradation efficiency under different operational conditions. There are three types of kinetic models for catalytic degradation of toluene: Power law (PL), Langmuir, and Marsvan Krevelen (MVK) models. The Power-law model appears not to provide the description of reaction chemistry and there is no direct connection to the mechanisms of reactions. Langmuir model is built on E-R (Eley-Rideal) and L-H (Langmuir-Hinshelwood) mechanisms. E-R mechanism supposes that the reaction occurs between the adsorbed oxygen and gaseous toluene rather than the toluene which is adsorbed. The L-H mechanism supposes that the adsorbed oxygen reacts with adsorbed toluene. MVK model describes the adsorbed toluene reacts first with oxygen inside the catalyst and then the reduction of metal oxides takes place; after that, the reduced metal oxides undergo reoxidation by gas phase oxygen. Based on the literature, the MVK model is more widely used when it comes to the degradation of toluene by various metal-based catalysts (Lyu et al. 2020).</p>
        <p>Understanding the reaction mechanism of catalytic oxidation of toluene by different types of catalysts is one of the key points for developing a suitable catalyst of low cost, high performance, and good stability. As mentioned earlier, there are different types of catalysts for toluene oxidation, and those catalysts may have different reaction mechanisms due to their various structure and composition that may influence different intermediate species formation. In general, the proposed reaction mechanisms for catalytic toluene degradation fall into two major categories: Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) model (major) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) model (minor) (Kamal et al. 2016). In the MVK model (Figure 6a), which is also called the redox mechanism, the reaction occurs between the adsorbed toluene and the catalyst's lattice oxygen instead of gaseous oxygen. This model assumes that toluene oxidation occurs in two steps. In the initial step, the metal oxide reduction results from the reaction between oxygen in a catalyst and adsorbed toluene, while in the next step, there is a reoxidation of reduced metal oxide caused by gaseous oxygen available in the feed (Zang et al. 2019). In the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) model (Figure 6b), the reaction occurs at the catalyst surface. The first step of this model is the adsorption of toluene and oxygen on the surface of the catalyst, then the redox process takes place later. In this mechanism, the toluene adsorption and catalyst's surface oxygen are necessary because the reaction occurs between these two types of adsorbed molecules (Zang et al. 2019). Thus, different catalysts will have different reaction mechanisms and kinetics due to their compositions. Hosseini et al. 2012 reported that toluene oxidation reaction follows the L-H model when Pd-Au/TiO2 is used as a catalyst. In this reaction, the toluene molecule has been found to compete with the oxygen molecule for getting adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. The reaction mechanism and reaction pathway of toluene degradation over MnOx-M-350 catalyst was studied. During the study, XPS results of O1s showed that the majority of oxygen species on the catalyst's surface were lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen (Guo et al. 2019). Firstly, the reaction occurs at the catalyst's surface where the C-H bond of -CH3 from adsorbed toluene reacts with the lattice oxygen as stated by the MVK mechanism, resulting in benzaldehyde intermediates generation where their aldehyde groups are further oxidized to benzoic acid intermediates that will react with adsorbed oxygen to give CO2 as shown in Figure 7. CoMn2O4 spinel catalyst. In the proposed mechanism, the first step is the oxidation of adsorbed toluene to alkoxide caused by surface oxygen, followed by the oxidation of alkoxide to benzoate, then benzoate is oxidized to anhydride that will be oxidized to acetate, and finally, acetate is oxidized to CO2 as shown in Figure 8. Interestingly, Liu et al. (2019a) reported the change mechanism of active species ions during the toluene oxidation over SmMnO3 perovskite catalyst. In their work, they used the in-situ DRIFTS method in N2 to change the catalyst's surface structure by removing the adsorbed oxygen species on the catalyst surface. At 120 °C, no significant change was found in the infrared spectrum before the addition of toluene, but immediate infrared spectrum change was observed right after feeding toluene, showing that various reactions occurred on the catalyst surface. Although no oxygen was added to the system, characteristic peaks of CO2, -OH, -COOH, and -CO3 2-appeared in the spectrum, and their intensities increased with reaction temperature. This showed the involvement of lattice oxygen in the oxidation of toluene. From Figure 9, it can be easily seen that there is a formation of CO2 and H2O from the reaction between VOC molecules and adsorbed oxygen overflown from oxygen vacancies. The movement of lattice oxygen to the surface, the creation of adsorbed oxygen, and the change of Mn n+ to Mn (n-1)+ by electron transfer were caused by the generation of oxygen vacancies. There was continuous adsorption of gas-phase oxygen into oxygen vacancies, and this facilitates the reduction of Mn n+ to Mn (n-1)+ and acceptance of electrons from the reactants for the formation of molecular oxygen (O2 -). The continuous appearance of VOC molecule oxidation was promoted by the conversion of molecular oxygen into lattice oxygen and active adsorbed oxygen (Liu et al. 2019b). For this case, it is the change mechanism of active species where the oxidation reaction was dependent on the synergism of lattice oxygen, adsorbed oxygen, and oxygen vacancies. Hence, the reaction mechanism shows a combination of MKV and L-H models. (Sihaib et al. 2017). Niu et al. (2018) investigated the reaction kinetics of catalytic oxidation of toluene over Cu1-yMn2CeyOx/sepiolite catalyst using two different kinetic models, including Power-rate Law and MVK models. Their results revealed that Power-rate Law was unsuitable for the description of the toluene oxidation reaction kinetic over the catalysts, but the MVK mechanism was found to be a good model for describing toluene catalytic degradation kinetics as it provided a better fit (R 2 ≥ 0.99) with the experimental data. MVK kinetic model was built up based on the redox process, including the oxidation and reduction steps. In the oxidation step, toluene gets adsorbed and reacts at the oxidation active sites, resulting in the formation of oxidation products and reduced active sites; in the reduction step, the oxygen gets reduced at the reduced active sites and then the oxidation state activity can occur (Niu et al. 2018). The kinetic model was expressed as: -ri = KiCiθ and -roi = KoiCoi (1 -θ), where θ is coverage rate of the surface oxidation activity of the catalyst; -ri and -roi are reaction rate of VOCs and oxygen consumption (mol•(cm 3 •s) -1 ), respectively; Ki and Koi are the rate of catalyst surface reduction and oxidation reaction(s -1 ), respectively; and Ci and Coi are the concentration of VOCs and oxygen (mol•(cm 3 ) -1 ), respectively. 1 mol VOCs were oxidized to consume αi mol oxygen, and -roi = -αi-ri could be calculated. Thus, for this approach, measured rate of reaction (Eq.1) is expressed based on the above equations. The conversion of toluene to CO2 is a complex process and multistep reaction. Shortly, step one is the toluene adsorption on the surface of the catalyst via abstraction of H from methyl group to generate benzoyl and later form aromatic ring-based intermediates like benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and benzoate molecules. Then, the aromatic rings on the intermediates are attacked by the surface oxygen to form other intermediates without aromatic ring, like carboxylate and maleic anhydride which will then undergo oxidation to form H2O and CO2. The lattice oxygen consumed for the whole process could be refilled by gas-phase oxygen. The properties of the catalysts could determine the intermediates produced in the reaction. Investigating the kinetics and mechanism of catalytic reaction provides a deeper comprehension of catalytic reaction processes and an effective guidance for the enhancement of catalyst activity. From the literature, there are few reports on kinetics and reaction mechanisms of toluene catalytic oxidation over various types of catalysts. Therefore, it is needed for further studies on the mechanism and kinetics of toluene oxidation under different catalysts in a deep and comprehensive way. This will help researchers to get more information and a basis for designing cost-effective catalysts for industrial applications.</p>
        <p>Future research can also focus more on the combination of MKV and L-H models.</p>
        <p>In this review paper, we present a brief investigation of catalytic degradation of toluene over five different types of catalysts, including noble metal, transition metal, perovskite, metal-organic framework (MOFs), and spinel-based catalysts, and sum up the techniques improving their activity.</p>
        <p>Noble metal catalysts show excellent performance at low temperatures, even less than 100 ℃, but in practical application, they are limited by their high cost and scarcity. Transition metals are plentiful and cheap compared to noble metals, but their based catalysts are restricted by their low performance. Recent studies have paid much attention to the amelioration and exploitation of different morphologies and structures of these transition metal catalysts. Thus, more studies are still needed in the amelioration of their structured morphologies and redox properties.</p>
        <p>Various factors like active metal elements, used support, specific surface area, dispersion of the active metal on the support, doping of other metal elements, particle size, and preparation methods could influence catalysts' catalytic activity towards toluene oxidation. The use of mixed/composite metal based on more than one noble metal or transition metal, which can be supported or unsupported, was also reported to enhance the performance of the catalyst. As challenges in the catalytic technology of toluene are still confusing, there is a need for innovations in the development of new catalysts that can be cheaper, more stable, selective, durable, and that can work at the lower reaction temperature. There are few research papers reported on metal-organic framework (MOFs), core-shell, and spinel-based catalysts for toluene oxidation, and those catalysts have been found to exhibit high catalytic performance at low temperatures. Therefore, future research should focus on the invention of non-noble metal-based catalysts derived from metal-organic frameworks to decrease the cost and reaction temperature for the total conversion of toluene.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the doping of noble metals in the core-shell and spinel catalysts should be explored. Besides, as the synthesis methods are correlated to the specific surface area, preparation methods should be focused on enhancing the surface area of perovskite catalysts, and this should overcome their limitations of low surface area. Development of molecular modeling using theoretical calculations and models for predicting the reaction's behavior and simulating the effects of heat-and mass transfer in the system should also be exploited. For instance, quantitative structure-activity relationship research could be used to design the appropriate catalyst, simulating and developing models for designing reactors.</p>
