        <p>The present study investigates the synthesis of novel strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba) modified crystalline zeolites including Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5) and Mordenite (MOR) by a batch-wise ion-exchange method with an appropriate chloride solution of 3 N at pH 7.2 and 50 ℃ and coated that modified zeolites (Ba-ZSM-5 and Ba-MOR, Sr-ZSM-5 and Sr-MOR) with an inert metal (Pt) by a novel supercritical CO2 method by using the PtMe2COD as a precursor for n-hexane hydroisomerization in a micro-reactor unit at different temperatures (250-325 ℃), H2/HC ratios of 3, 6, and 9 and pressure of 5 bar. The acidic and physical features of the Pt loaded zeolites were systematically characterized using FT-IR, XRD, BET surface area measurements, TGA, and TEM techniques. It is found that the metal loading in scCO2 results in more uniform and very small metal nanoparticle (1.37 nm) dispersion with high stability after reduction and revealed that high loading pressure in scCO2 (280-300 bar) results in higher catalytic activity and surface area. The maximum conversion and selectivity of about 80 and 90% for the n-hexane isomerization were achieved at 275 ℃ and H2/HC ratio of 6 for Pt/Sr-ZSM-5 catalyst. Results reported that Pt loaded over all the zeolites (H-MOR, Sr-MOR, Ba-MOR, H-ZSM-5, Ba-ZSM-5, and Sr-ZSM-5) by scCO2 method showed the minimum production of cracking products (C1-C5) and maximum isomeric products including iso-C6 isomers (2,2-DMB, 2,3-DMB, 2-MP, and 3-MP). Furthermore, the overall results of the rate of reaction revealed that Pt/Sr-ZSM-5 and Pt/Ba-ZSM-5 catalysts showed a better rate of isomerization (46.44%) and conversion (47%) for n-hexane at 300 ℃, and H2/HC ratio of 9 with a minimum rate of cracking. However, it is concluded that the small, pored size Pt loaded ZSM-5 zeolite showed the highest catalytical activity contrast to large pored MOR zeolite and considered as of great interest for diesel and gasoline formation in the oil refining industry.The present study investigates the synthesis of novel strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba) modified crystalline zeolites including Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5) and Mordenite (MOR) by a batch-wise ion-exchange method with an appropriate chloride solution of 3 N at pH 7.2 and 50 ℃ and coated that modified zeolites (Ba-ZSM-5 and Ba-MOR, Sr-ZSM-5 and Sr-MOR) with an inert metal (Pt) by a novel supercritical CO2 method by using the PtMe2COD as a precursor for n-hexane hydroisomerization in a micro-reactor unit at different temperatures (250-325 ℃), H2/HC ratios of 3, 6, and 9 and pressure of 5 bar.

        <p>With increasing the world population and new technologies, the demand for fuels like gasoline, diesel, and kerosene is increasing day by day to fulfill the challenge of quality fuel. 1 During the past few decades, the isomerization of n-C5-C6-C7 alkanes got considerable attention toward the petroleum industry due to their high-octane number and branched isomers products. 2 Mostly, different bifunctional catalysts are applied for the hydroisomerization of n-C6 alkanes (n-hexane) that consist of two active sites. One is a noble metal site for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions and other acid sites on the surface of the support (like activated alumina and zeolite) for isomerization, cracking, and cyclization reactions. 3 It is noted that the isomerization of n-C6 alkanes is critical for the production of environmentally friendly and sulfur-free fuel with a high octane number. 4 Previously many types of bifunctional catalysts including Pt/Cl/alumina, Pt/HPW/MCM-41, Pt or Ni/MOR, Pt/ZSM-5, and Pd/MCM-22 have been used for n-hexane isomerization in the petroleum industry. [5][6][7] Recently, the isomerization of n-C5-C6-C7 alkanes have been improved in different ways including; 1) the usage of composite zeolites (zeolite A, Mordenite, ZSM-5) loaded by noble metals (Pt, Pd, and Zn) to facilitate the formation of isomer products; 2) the isomerization is performed at fewer temperature to facilitate the formation of isomerized products over zeolite; 3) the hydride transfer agents are used to significantly decrease the cracking products and increased the branched products. 8 The zeolites are assumed as significant catalysts for the conversion of hydrocarbon especially n-C6 alkanes at an industrial scale. 9 The activity of zeolites is mainly dependent on the presence of Bronsted acidic bridges such as Si-OH-Al that bears the tetrahedrally aluminum and silicon atoms in the structure.With increasing the world population and new technologies, the demand for fuels like gasoline, diesel, and kerosene is increasing day by day to fulfill the challenge of quality fuel. 1 During the past few decades, the isomerization of n-C5-C6-C7 alkanes got considerable attention toward the petroleum industry due to their high-octane number and branched isomers products. 2 Mostly, different bifunctional catalysts are applied for the hydroisomerization of n-C6 alkanes (n-hexane) that consist of two active sites.

        <p>However, the alkanes bind to the charged zeolite frameworks just like induced dipole for the isomerization, cracking, and aromatization reactions. 10 Mordenite (MOR) and Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5) zeolites are considered as highly important catalysts for n-C5-C6-C7 alkanes isomerization because of high hydrolytic stability, thermal stability, good acidic properties, and selectivity. Furthermore, the ZSM-5 and MOR zeolites possess great activity in contrast to former zeolites in the conversion of n-C5-C6-C7 alkanes to diesel fractions and gasoline. [11][12][13] Pastvova et al., 14 reported that H-MOR zeolite showed the 58% conversion of n-hexane at 275 ℃ that start to decrease at higher temperatures (&gt;300 ℃) due to non-selective cracking reactions. Yeh et al., 15 stated that H-ZSM-5 catalyst showed only 4.0% conversion of n-hexane at 137 bar and 633 K temperature, and 3.6% conversion at 137 bar and 823 K. However, due to the few limitations including the low conversion rate, deactivation, and loss of activity during the isomerization of n-C5-C6-C7 alkanes there was a need to develop an updated version of ZSM-5 and MOR catalysts 16 . Therefore, several metal species including Pd, Ga, Ni, Ir, Zn, Fe, Mo, Co, Cu, Ru, Zr, and Pt were loaded on the zeolites framework for better stability, selectivity, and activity by different methods including the impregnated and supercritical CO2. 1,17,18 Among all, platinum (Pt) is known as an extremely effective metal for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions. The Pt loading over the zeolites increased the bifunctionality of catalysts by modifying the acidic active sites and formation of redox sites that are considered as highly effective and stable for n-C5-C6-C7 alkanes hydroisomerization. [19][20][21] Yeh et al., 22 demonstrated that loading of Pt over ZSM-5 (Pt/ZSM-5) by impregnated method showed the 9.8 and 9.2% n-hexane conversion at 633 and 723 K temperature respectively with 137 bar constant pressure. They also revealed that Pt/ZSM-5 reported the maximum yield of about 12.5 and 8.9% for iso-C6 isomers with an average 9.2% production of the cracked product at the same temperature and pressure. Sousa et al. 23 reported that Pt/H-MOR (1.10 wt%) showed that the highest conversion and selectivity of about 38 and 96% respectively for the isomerization of n-hexane at 1 atm pressure and 250 ℃.However, the alkanes bind to the charged zeolite frameworks just like induced dipole for the isomerization, cracking, and aromatization reactions. 10 Mordenite (MOR) and Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5) zeolites are considered as highly important catalysts for n-C5-C6-C7 alkanes isomerization because of high hydrolytic stability, thermal stability, good acidic properties, and selectivity.

        <p>Monteiro and coworkers 24 investigated the loading of Pt over the H-MOR zeolite (Pt/H-MOR) by an impregnated method and observed 100% conversion for n-hexane with 2.4 mol/h g activity. They also reported 46.1, 28.6, 4.5, 11.3, and 4.9% yield for 2,3-dimethylbutane (2,3-DMB), 2,2-dimethylbutane (2,2-DMB), 3-methylpentane (3-MP) and 2-methylpentane (2-MP), and cracked products (C1-C5) respectively at 250 ℃ and contact time of 1/WHSV. Similarly, Travkina et al., 25 observed that Pt/H-MOR (0.5) revealed the yield of about 1.0% of iso-C6 isomer after n-hexane isomerization at 250 ℃ that increased to 5.3% at 400 ℃ along with average 3.1% production of cracked products at 250 ℃ and 16.95% at 400 ℃ at 3.0 MPa pressure and 1.5 1/h space velocity. The above-cited literature showed that Pt loaded Mordenite (MOR) and Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5) (Pt/MOR and Pt/ZSM-5) are the most selective and active catalysts towards the isomerization of n-hexane but the rate of formation of cracking gases are equally high in the previously reported studies because of density and strength of sites of Bronsted acid alongside with space restrictions in the zeolites. 26 In addition, the control of dealumination or desilication by increasing the mesoporosity showed good selectivity but equally decreased the activity of the catalyst by reducing the acidity. 27 However, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, the proton in zeolites (H-MOR and H-ZSM-5) was exchanged by Sr and Ba (Sr-ZSM-5 and Sr-MOR, Ba-ZSM-5 and Ba-MOR) ions for better activities and reduce the cracking products in n-hexane hydroisomerization. Also, for the first time, the Pt was loaded by a supercritical fluid CO2 (scCO2) method along with an impregnated method to expand the catalysts surface area, better isomerization, and comparison of results obtained by two methods. Furthermore, the present study investigated the effect of different parameters including temperature (250-325 ℃), pressure (1-5 bar), and H2/HC ratio (3, 6, and 9) on isomerization of n-hexane. Also, the low Pt content (0.3 wt%) is loaded over both zeolites to reduce the cost and achieve the desirable acid/metal sites ratio for n-hexane hydroisomerization. The present study also discussed the kinetic analysis and activation energy of the zeolite catalysts for a better understanding.Monteiro and coworkers 24 investigated the loading of Pt over the H-MOR zeolite (Pt/H-MOR) by an impregnated method and observed 100% conversion for n-hexane with 2.4 mol/h g activity.

        <p>The n-hexane hydroisomerization studies of the catalysts were performed in a micro-catalytic reactor unit (ITMC, RWTH). A stainless-steel reactor was designed in a mechanical workshop in RWTH, Germany, with a length of 15 cm and an inner and outer diameter of 20 and 50 mm, respectively (see Fig. 2). The Pt loading over cations H, Ba, and Sr for the zeolite samples (ZSM-5 and MOR) by supercritical CO2 were analyzed for n-hexane isomerization and compared with Pt loaded by the impregnation method. 8 g of each catalyst, originally extruded (1.5 d*2-3 L mm) loaded into the reactor and remained under the flow of oxygen for 4 h at 350 ℃ and then cleaned with pure N2 at 450 ℃ for 15 min and cooled at 250 ℃.The n-hexane hydroisomerization studies of the catalysts were performed in a micro-catalytic reactor unit (ITMC, RWTH).

        <p>The infrared spectroscopy lattice vibration spectra in the range of 400-4000 cm -1 for original (H-MOR and H-ZSM-5) and activated zeolite (Ba-MOR, Sr-MOR, Ba-ZSM-5, and Sr-ZSM-5) are presented in Fig. 3 (a,b). Fig. 3 (a,b) showed the original spectra of 3444.2 cm -1 for H-ZSM-5 and 3448.6 cm -1 for H-MOR zeolite samples which are the characteristic of Bronsted acid protons. Izan et al., 12 also confirms the presence of 3610 and 3740 cm -1 bands in HBEA and activated HSi@BEA spectrums due to the addition of silicate material. The band at 800 cm -1 is because of symmetric stretching modes of Si-O-H, whereas a band at 585.8 cm -1 is due to Si-O-Si rocking. The bands at 1075 cm -1 attributed to the ratio of SiO2/Al2O3. 1The infrared spectroscopy lattice vibration spectra in the range of 400-4000 cm -1 for original (H-MOR and H-ZSM-5) and activated zeolite (Ba-MOR, Sr-MOR, Ba-ZSM-5, and Sr-ZSM-5) are presented in Fig. 3 (a,b).

        <p>Similarly, the bands between 1500-2200 cm -1 attributed to the stretching frequency of catalysts. 39 The O-H stretching was illustrated in the region of 3000-3700 cm -1 . Fig. 3 (a,b) also showed the IR spectra for the exchanged barium and strontium cations. Thus, spectra of all Ba-MOR, Ba-ZSM-5, Sr-ZSM-5, and Sr-MOR reported the same features to the original Hform of corresponding zeolite structure. Therefore, the infrared spectroscopy results in the conclusion, that the H-MOR, H-ZSM-5, Ba-ZSM-5, Ba-MOR, Sr-ZSM-5, and Sr-MOR zeolite have similar surface characteristics and structure before and after the ion exchange operation, but the ion-exchange of protons by Ba 2+/ Sr 2+ cations significantly changes the acidic properties of the zeolites and has a significant effect on catalytic performance. However, all the higher intensity peaks indicate the agitation of Si-O-Si mode because of the development of lamellar network outside the catalyst core, which area corresponds to the appearance of vibrational lattice frequency at 1856 cm -1 . 12Similarly, the bands between 1500-2200 cm -1 attributed to the stretching frequency of catalysts. 39 The O-H stretching was illustrated in the region of 3000-3700 cm -1 .

        <p>The BET surface area strongly dependent on the noble metal content of zeolite produced by the impregnation method, while the metal loading by supercritical CO2 (scCO2) presented a different sense. Table 1 showed the BET surface area, pore-volume, pore size, and pore area of unmodified (H-MOR and H-ZSM-5), modified (Ba-MOR, Ba-ZSM-5, Sr-ZSM-5, and Sr-MOR), and Pt loaded zeolite by scCO2. The maximum pore volume of about 0.53 cm 2 /g and area of pores of about 206.41 m 2 /g were identified for Pt loaded H-ZSM-5. Similarly, the maximum pore size of 105 Å was recorded for H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The findings showed that original zeolites including H-MOR and H-ZSM-5 showed the surface area of 539.21 and 403.74 m 2 /g respectively that reduced to 385.19 and 338.35 m 2 /g for both zeolites after Pt loading for24 h at 80 ℃ and 280 bar. The increase in the time duration resulting also increased the surface area that may be because of mesoporous creation and acid leaching in crystallites of zeolites. 43 It is worthy to note that the BET surface area depends on the size and quantity of platinum loaded. for Pt/H-ZSM-5 and Pt/H-MOR respectively.

        <p>The morphology features of the supported metal nanocomposites were characterized by High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). Fig. 6 (a,b,c,d) showed the TEM micrograph taken by High-Resolution TEM (HR-TEM). They give a comparison between the Pt-loading by impregnation method and the supercritical CO2 (scCO2) method. The mean nanoparticles size of Pt particles was confirmed as 8.85 and 6.89 nm for Pt/H-ZSM-5 and Pt/H-MOR respectively by impregnation loading method. Previously the TEM microgram showed the Pt nanoparticles size between 30-70 nm by impregnation loading method that could be significantly decreased (10-40 nm) by increasing the Pt content to 0.6-0.9%. 45 The distribution of particles is the approximately equal size and equal distance that can be obtained by loading with scCO2. However, the average Pt nanoparticles size was confirmed as 1.84 and 1.38 nm for Pt/H-MOR and Pt/H-ZSM-5 respectively by the scCO2 method. The smaller size of Pt loaded zeolites in the present study could be because of carbon present as a template in the zeolite that significantly facilitates the greater nucleation rate contrast to crystal construction rate and resulted in the production of beneficial small-sized zeolite particles. 46The morphology features of the supported metal nanocomposites were characterized by High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM).

        <p>Extrudes of the zeolites including H-MOR and H-ZSM-5 were exchanged with two different cations including strontium and barium (Sr and Ba). The Sr and Ba were selected for the ionexchange due to their very fewer effects toward decrease the crystallinity of zeolites after a longer treatment time as compared to acids like HCl. 47 Fig. 7 demonstrated the impact of treatment time on the cation content and calcination in the zeolites. As expected, the percent of ion exchange for Sr and Ba was increased with treatment time. This increase was not linear and differs according to the cation solutions and the type of zeolites. The highest percentage of ionexchange of about 25.21 mg/g was achieved with Sr for the large-pored Mordenite zeolite after 2.5 h treatment. However, the replacement of hydrogen ion by barium was noticeable less as compared to strontium ion for both zeolite types. The pH of the solutions was decreased directly when the cationic solutions were added to the zeolite samples due to the formation of a mild concentration of HCl by ion exchange. Therefore 0.1 N solution of NaOH was added to maintain the pH of solution around 7.0. 48Extrudes of the zeolites including H-MOR and H-ZSM-5 were exchanged with two different cations including strontium and barium (Sr and Ba).

        <p>The temperature and H2/HC ratios' effects on the selectivity and conversion for unmodified Pt/H-MOR and Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts by an impregnated method are presented in Fig. 8, while for supercritical CO2 are summarized in Fig. 9 at 5 bar pressure. The temperature impact was studied at different temperatures range as 250-325 o C and the H2/HC ratio was quantified as 3, 6, and 9. The maximum 92.09% conversion of n-hexane was achieved for Pt/H-MOR at 325 ℃ and H2/HC ratio of 6 by the impregnation method. Similarly, the maximum selectivity of about 99% was observed at a lower temperature of 250 o C and all H2/HC ratios for both catalysts (Pt/H-MOR and Pt/H-ZSM-5) loaded by scCO2. Tamizhdurai et al. 43 stated that the maximum of 91.4% of n-hexane conversion activity was achieved for MOR at 250 o C that reduced to 82.5% at a higher temperature, and suggested that 250 o C is the optimum temperature for the conversion of n-hexane with MOR (40) catalyst. Similarly, Luo et al. 44 observed that H-MOR, USY, H-BEA, and H-ZSM-5 catalysts showed the maximum n-hexane conversion of about 6.8, 12.1, 15.4, and 11.7% respectively at 633 K and 137 bar.The temperature and H2/HC ratios' effects on the selectivity and conversion for unmodified Pt/H-MOR and Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts by an impregnated method are presented in Fig. 8, while for supercritical CO2 are summarized in Fig. 9 at 5 bar pressure.

        <p>It is reported that the temperature rise precedes a gradual increase in conversion rate, while the selectivity decreases with temperature increase. It could be concluded that 290 o C is the optimum temperature and 6 is the optimum H2/HC ratio to achieve selectivity more than 90% and conversion about 65-76% for both zeolites including Pt/H-MOR and Pt/H-ZSM-5.It is reported that the temperature rise precedes a gradual increase in conversion rate, while the selectivity decreases with temperature increase.

Moreover, hydrogen to hydrocarbon ratio seems to be having little effect on n-hexane isomerization and hydrocracking. All findings showed that the percentage of n-hexane conversion is slightly higher on catalysts prepared by impregnation method than supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) technique, while the selectivity towards C6-isomers is significantly higher on catalysts prepared in scCO2 than impregnation for all temperatures and H2/HC ratios studied. Our findings are also in agreement with previously reported studies, Sazama and coworkers stated that Pt loaded ZSM-5 zeolite showed the better n-hexane conversion rate and turnover frequency for 2-MP and 3-MP than the BEA zeolites. 36 Huang et al. 49 reported that conversion of n-hexane over H-Y and H-ZSM-5 catalysts was about 3.5% (673 ℃) and 2.8% (588 ℃) respectively with a turnover frequency of about 0.24 and 0.08% at 6 MPa pressure.Furthermore, the results showed that the Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst is more effective and selective than Pt/H-MOR catalyst for n-hexane isomerization based on temperature and H2/HC ratio effects.

        <p>The n-hexane isomerization reaction results in four major different types of iso-C6 isomers Similarly, greater of 39.29 and 31.44% yield of 2-MP and 3-MP were achieved for scCO2 loaded Pt/H-ZSM-5 at 275 o C and H2/HC ratio of 9. Findings also revealed that the temperature impact on the production of C1-C5 hydrocarbons produced interesting results. At 5 bar and H2/HC ratio of 9, the yield of cracked products (C1-C5) was about an average of 21.25% for the Pt/H-MOR catalysts loaded by impregnation at all temperatures. However, the catalysts loaded by scCO2, showed nearly an average 8.62% yield of cracked products at H2/HC ratio of 9 and all temperatures for Pt/H-ZSM-5. The outcomes revealed that the catalysts of scCO2 showed a significant reduction in the formation of cracked products as compared to impregnated catalysts. Our findings are also correlated with the previously reported studies, Pastvova et al. 51 stated that hydroisomerization of n-hexane by Pt/H-MOR/5.8 catalyst results in a lower yield of iso-C6 isomers (2,2-DMB, 2-MP, 3-MP, and 2,3-DMB) at a lower temperature (150 o C) that increased up to 44% at 275 o C, but surprisingly decreased to 23% at a higher temperature (325 o C).

        <p>Similarly, Modhera et al., 52 described that n-hexane hydro-isomerization by ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst results in a yield of about 32.67 and 23.85% of 2-MP and 3-MP respectively with a smaller yield of cracked products (0.30%) at 623 K temperature and 10 atm pressure.Similarly, Modhera et al., 52 described that n-hexane hydro-isomerization by ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst results in a yield of about 32.67 and 23.85% of 2-MP and 3-MP respectively with a smaller yield of cracked products (0.30%) at 623 K temperature and 10 atm pressure.</p>
        <p>According to the findings, the yields of 2-MP and 3-MP for catalysts loaded by scCO2 are higher than those prepared by the impregnation method, because the former method gives uniform metal distribution on the support and resulted in more selective catalyst behavior.According to the findings, the yields of 2-MP and 3-MP for catalysts loaded by scCO2 are higher than those prepared by the impregnation method, because the former method gives uniform metal distribution on the support and resulted in more selective catalyst behavior.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Pt/H-ZSM-5 showed more selectivity towards 2-MP and 3-MP than Pt/H-MOR generally for both loading methods. Generally, the findings revealed that the maximum yields for 2-MP and 3-MP were achieved at 275 o C within the temperature range of 250-325 o C. The decline of yields by increasing the temperature is probably due to hydrocracking of these iso-C6 isomers (2-MP and 3-MP) to low hydrocarbons mainly by using impregnated loading catalysts. The findings also indicated that the decrease in yield by increasing temperature is more noticeable for impregnated catalysts than scCO2. Huang and his research group revealed that the molar selectivity of n-hexane was 16 and 70% for iso-C6 isomers and about 4 and 15%Furthermore, Pt/H-ZSM-5 showed more selectivity towards 2-MP and 3-MP than Pt/H-MOR generally for both loading methods.

The previously published researches also revealed that modified MOR zeolite is much active and selective among all studied zeolites due to its strong acidic bridge of Si-OH-Al for the hydroisomerization of n-hexane. 53,54 Sazama et al., 55 observed that Si/Al-rich Pt/H-BEA catalyst significantly increase n-hexane to iso-hexane conversion rate from 5.9 to 35.5% at high density and 175 o C without the formation of any by-product gases.The average 99 and 96% selectivity reported for both Sr modified catalysts (Pt/Sr-ZSM-5 and Pt/Sr-MOR) that gradually decreased to average 86 and 74% respectively by enhancing the temperature range from 250 to 325 o C.

        <p>Similarly, Nasser et al., 56 revealed that the dealuminated of MOR zeolite with 1M nitric acid for 20 min treatment only give 20% catalytic conversion of n-hexane that is reduced to 17.3% after 240 min treatment mainly due to pore blockage by reduction of mesopore channels or coke. Martins and his research group demonstrated that the 40Ni60Pt/H-MOR catalyst showed the maximum n-hexane conversion of about 24%, while the 60Ni40Pt/H-MOR revealed the 99% selectivity at 250 o C. 57 It is concluded that a temperature of 300 o C is an optimum temperature to get about 90-94% isomerization selectivity with about 77% conversion of nhexane by all Ba and Sr modified Pt-zeolites.

The findings suggested that the ZSM-5 catalysts were much energetic for these isomers than MOR catalysts. The findings also showed the yield of more volatile isomers including Dimethylbutanes (DMB) reported that the MOR zeolite catalysts were highly selective to DMB production rather than ZSM-5 catalysts could be because of channel structure, the influence of acidity, metallic centers distribution, pore size, and dispersion. 51 The yields of these isomersThe overall percentage yields of 2-MP and 3-MP isomers were increased as temperature increase from 250 to 300 o C and then decreased at 325 o C on all catalyst types.
