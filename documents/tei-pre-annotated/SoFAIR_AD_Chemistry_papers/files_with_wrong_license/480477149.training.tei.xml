        <p>This work reports the electrochemical detection of bisphenol A (BPA) using a novel and sensitive electrochemical sensor based on the Cu functionalized SBA-15 like periodic mesoporous organosilica-ionic liquid composite modified glassy carbon electrode (Cu@TU-PMO/IL/GCE). The structural morphology of Cu@TU-PMO is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The catalytic activity of the modified electrode toward oxidation of BPA was interrogated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) using the fabricated sensor. The electrochemical detection of the analyte was carried out at a neutral pH and the scan rate studies revealed that the sensor was stable. Under the optimal conditions, a linear range from 5.0 nM to 2.0 µM and 4.0 to 500 µM for detecting BPA was observed with a detection limit of 1.5 nM (S/N = 3). The sensor was applied to detect BPA in tap and seawater samples, and the accuracy of the results was validated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The proposed method provides a powerful tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of BPA in environmental samples.This work reports the electrochemical detection of bisphenol A (BPA) using a novel and sensitive electrochemical sensor based on the Cu functionalized SBA-15 like periodic mesoporous organosilica-ionic liquid composite modified glassy carbon electrode (Cu@TU-PMO/IL/GCE).

        <p>One of the essential industrial EDCs that have gained vast interest is bisphenol A (BPA). Bisphenol A (2,2-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl) propane) is a synthetic compound widely employed in the polymer industry as a precursor in the production of polysolfune resin, epoxy resins, and polycarbonates plastics. These plastics are used in the food and drink packaging applications, including plastic beverage containers, baby bottles, water, and milk bottles. Unfortunately, these plastics are disposed of into the environment and are accumulated in various water bodies (Apodaca, Pernites, Ponnapati, Del Mundo, &amp; Advincula, 2011;Geens et al., 2012;Hengstler et al., 2011;Vandenberg et al., 2009).One of the essential industrial EDCs that have gained vast interest is bisphenol A (BPA).

        <p>In recent studies, BPA was reported to be responsible for the endocrine disorder, threatening the health of pregnant women, foetus, and children (Chen et al., 2017;Rosenfeld, 2017). Hence, due to this report, it is imperative to develop rapid and reliable methods with high accuracy and precision for the determination of bisphenol A. Conventionally, various methods such as fluorimetry (Kim, Jeon, &amp; Chang, 2012), chromatographic techniques coupled with mass spectrometry (Chang, Chou, &amp; Lee, 2005;Nerín, Philo, Salafranca, &amp; Castle, 2002), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Maiolini et al., 2014) and chemiluminescence (Ragavan &amp; Rastogi, 2016) have been employed for the detection of BPA. However, application most of these techniques is restricted due to the number of disadvantages such as expensive and complicated instruments, advanced technical expertise and timeconsuming (Duan et al., 2018).In recent studies, BPA was reported to be responsible for the endocrine disorder, threatening the health of pregnant women, foetus, and children (Chen et al., 2017;Rosenfeld, 2017).

        <p>The electrochemical techniques have recently become more admissible and attractive due to their fast response, high sensitivity, low-cost, and in-situ monitoring (Darabi &amp; Shabani-Nooshabadi, 2021;Karimi-Maleh et al., 2021b;Tahernejad-Javazmi, Shabani-Nooshabadi, &amp; Karimi-Maleh, 2019;Tian et al., 2018). Since the direct determination of BPA using bare electrode provide low selectivity and sensitivity owing to the fouling effect and BPA overoxidation (Murugananthan, Yoshihara, Rakuma, &amp; Shirakashi, 2008); several efforts have been devoted to modifying electrodes with various materials such as nanoparticles, graphene and carbon nanotubes (Ben Messaoud, Ghica, Dridi, Ben Ali, &amp; Brett, 2017;Karimi-Maleh et al., 2021a;Krishnendu, Sarit, Chaekyu, Xiaoning, &amp; Vincent, 2014;Xin, Sun, Li, Wang, &amp; Jia, 2015). Nevertheless, some satisfying results have been obtained, however, development of a more efficient and straightforward electrochemical sensors for the detection of BPA remains major challenge in nano-electrochemistry.The electrochemical techniques have recently become more admissible and attractive due to their fast response, high sensitivity, low-cost, and in-situ monitoring (Darabi &amp; Shabani-Nooshabadi, 2021;Karimi-Maleh et al., 2021b;Tahernejad-Javazmi, Shabani-Nooshabadi, &amp; Karimi-Maleh, 2019;Tian et al., 2018).

        <p>The electrodes modified with periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) show high sensitivity owing to their large surface area and tunable pore structure (Wu et al., 2019). PMO with unique nanostructure and properties have recently received a great deal of attention due to easy modification of frameworks without pore blocking, highly ordered structure, extraordinary hydrothermal and mechanical stability, high specific surface area and pore volume. These properties help obtain many active sites and permit diffusion and adsorption of large molecules on the PMO surface (Esquivel, Van Der Voort, &amp; Romero-Salguero, 2014). These remarkable features make them a promising material in wide range of application including catalysis (Moaser et al., 2020), membranes and separation platform (Samiey, Cheng, &amp; Wu, 2014), drug delivery system (Esquivel et al., 2014), water treatment and sensor (Chandra, Das, &amp; Bhaumik, 2010;Morante-Zarcero, Pérez-Quintanilla, &amp; Sierra, 2015).The electrodes modified with periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) show high sensitivity owing to their large surface area and tunable pore structure (Wu et al., 2019).

Based on the high electrocatalytic responses to BPA at Cu@TU-PMO/IL/GCE, a novel electrochemical sensor was developed for the detection of BPA. The designed sensor showed good performance with a wide linear range, a low detection limit, and had excellent reproducibility, stability and selectivity for the detection of BPA.

        <p>Electrochemical analysis, such as cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry, were carried out using Auto-Lab potentiostat-galvanostat (ECO Chemie, Utrecht, Netherlands) equipped with a PGSTAT 30 module and driven by GPES (ECO Chemie). A threeelectrode system, including a saturated Ag/AgCl (KCl saturated), was used as the reference electrode, a platinum wire as a counter electrode, and a bare GCE or modified GCE (Cu@TU-PMO) as a working electrode. The UHPLC system used consisted of two pumps of a platin blue P-1 solvent delivery system, a diode array detector (PDA-1) operated at 217 nm, a column oven manager and an analytical column (Blue Orchid C18, 1.8 µm, 50 × 2 mm), all from Knauer, Berlin, Germany. A mixture of water-acetonitrile (60:40 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL min was used as the mobile phase. The column oven temperature was set at 40 ℃.

        <p>The synthesis of the SBA-15 like Cu@TU-PMO was accomplished in two steps. The thiourea based PMO with a 2D-hexagonal symmetry was first prepared following a co-condensation of TEOS and as-synthseized bis-thioure in the presence of P123 under acidic conditions, wherein the bis-thiourea was employed as thiourea precursors. Consideration the fact that, metal species can have good coordination with thiourea based ligands (Al-Kady, Gaber, Hussein, &amp; Ebeid, 2009), thereby Cu 2+ species has been grafted inside the surface of TU-PMO through thiourea bridges.The synthesis of the SBA-15 like Cu@TU-PMO was accomplished in two steps.

        <p>The surface morphologies of Cu@TU-PMO was studied by both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1a-d). The SEM image of pure PMO (Fig. 1a) revealed the presence of an agglomerate rod-type structure with relatively uniform length. Besides, as can be seen from the TEM image (Fig. 1c), SBA-15 exhibited the two-dimensional hexagonal arrays of long cylindrical pores structure and one-dimensional pore channel which is characteristic of mesoporous materials. However, after loading of Cu 2+ , as shown in Fig. 1b, no significant effect either on morphology or structure of the thiourea based PMO could be observed, and it can be said that overall particle morphology similar to TU-PMO was obtained. In addition, the TEM image, as shown in Fig. 1d, clearly displayed a long-range order and uniform channel structure along the pore axis. Besides, it was found that the Cu@TU-PMO has a uniform pore size with an average diameter of 6.8 nm.The surface morphologies of Cu@TU-PMO was studied by both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1a-d).

        <p>The compositional analysis of surface morphology and topology from TU-PMO and Cu@TU-SBA-15 like PMO is considered by EDX, as shown in Fig. 2(a,b). It confirmed that the elements C, O, S, N, and Cu are present in the given sample. The N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms record the TU-PMO and Cu@TU-PMO's textural properties, as shown in Fig. 2c,d. As could be seen, the samples display typical type-IV isotherm with a H 1 hysteresis loop, which is characteristic of SBA-15 type mesoporous silica materials. The decline of the hysteresis loop and consequent decrease in surface area and pore volume of PMO maybe due to the deposition of Cu 2+ on internal surface of the mesoporous channels. Hence, the BET surface area of Cu@TU-PMO was 283 m 2 g -1 , which is less than the TU-PMO (390 m 2 g -1 ). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the high surface area is preserved even though the loading of Cu 2+ has occurred. Moreover, the average pore size was 6.8 nm for instead 2 nm for Cu-PMO using the BJH method (Fig. 2d).The compositional analysis of surface morphology and topology from TU-PMO and Cu@TU-SBA-15 like PMO is considered by EDX, as shown in Fig. 2(a,b).

        <p>Typical cyclic voltammograms of GCE, Cu@TU-PMO /GCE and Cu@TU-PMO -IL/GCE in the absence and presence of 0.1 mM BPA solution prepared in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) are shown in curves a, b and c of Fig. 4a andb, respectively. As reported, no anodic peak current was observed for BPA oxidation at GCE electrode (Fig. 3b curve a) that may be due to the high overpotential associated with the oxidation process. Cu@TU-PMO/GCE and Cu@TU-PMO -IL/GCE in the absence of BPA two oxidation peaks were observed on using the modified electrode, this revealed the oxidation of Cu(0) to Cu(I) and Cu(I) to Cu(II) and two reduction peaks revealed reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and Cu(I) to Cu(0) (Fig. 3a -curve b, c).Typical cyclic voltammograms of GCE, Cu@TU-PMO /GCE and Cu@TU-PMO -IL/GCE in the absence and presence of 0.1 mM BPA solution prepared in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) are shown in curves a, b and c of Fig. 4a andb, respectively.

        <p>By applying the Cu@TU-PMO (Fig. 3b, curve b), the anodic peak current of PMO-Cu (II) was enhanced because of the presence of BPA and the peak potential was shifted toward more negative values due to the electrocatalytic activity of Cu (II). In contrast, Cu@TU-PMO -IL/GCE (Fig. 3b curve c) showed a higher and sharper oxidation peak response than the other electrodes due to the electrocatalytic properties of Cu (II) and the presence of IL. The fabricated sensor (Cu@TU-PMO -IL/GCE) displayed excellent properties such as high electrical conductivity and high electrocatalytic activity. It is important to highlight that the ionic liquid help to facilitate electron communication on the electrode surface.By applying the Cu@TU-PMO (Fig. 3b, curve b), the anodic peak current of PMO-Cu (II) was enhanced because of the presence of BPA and the peak potential was shifted toward more negative values due to the electrocatalytic activity of Cu (II).

        <p>The effect of pH on bisphenol A determination was carried out because the ionic state of BPA can be affected by the proton environment. Also, the pH analysis helps to determine the pH where BPA is most available for the electrochemical detection using Cu@TU-PMO/GCE. The results obtained in Fig. 4a and b revealed that there was an enhancement in the peak current signal as pH value increases from 3 to 7 in the detection of 0.1 mM BPA. After this, a reduction in the peak current signal was observed. Hence, pH 7 was used as the working pH for the electrochemical detection of BPA.The effect of pH on bisphenol A determination was carried out because the ionic state of BPA can be affected by the proton environment.

        <p>Furthermore, there was a cathodic shift in the anodic peak potential (Epa) as pH increased. As shown in Fig. 4c, the plot displayed a good linear relationship between the Epa and pH, this suggests that protons played a pivotal role in the electrochemical detection of BPA. The regression equation obtained was Epa = -0.055pH + 0.3883 (R = 0.9827). This equation showed that the slope value of (55 mV/pH) was proximity with the theoretical value of 57.6 mV/pH. This result established that there was an equal transfer of proton and electron transfer in the electrochemical process. According to obtained data, the mechanism suggested for electrochemical oxidation of BPA was depicted in the Scheme S1 in Supporting Information part (UlubayKarabiberoglu, 2019).Furthermore, there was a cathodic shift in the anodic peak potential (Epa) as pH increased.

        <p>The cyclic voltammetry was used to interrogate the effect of scan rates on the constructed electrode Cu@TU-PMO/GCE; the findings revealed that there was an enhancement in the oxidation peak current signal as the scan rate increases from (10,20,30,60,80,90, and 100 mV/s), and the results were shown in Fig. S1a. This result confirmed that the electrochemical reaction of bisphenol A at the fabricated electrode is typical adsorption-controlled electrode process.

        <p>The correlation coefficient (r) is commonly used for this purpose, and curves with r ≥ 0.995 are usually considered to be linear.

        <p>To evaluate the modified electrodes' reproducibility, ten sensors (Cu@TU-PMO-IL/GCE) were prepared in the same way and were all used for the detection of 1 µM BPA solution. The relative standard deviation of 4.3% (n = 10) was obtained for the ten fabricated sensors. This result affirmed that the proposed sensor exhibited good reproducibility. In addition, a 1 µM vanillin solution was determined successively for ten times with a Cu@TU-PMO-IL/GCE, and the RSD value was found to be 3.7%, which affirmed the excellent repeatability of the fabricated sensor. The storage stability of the electrode was also examined. It was found that after stored in air for 2 weeks, the electrode retained 85% of its initial current response. Moreover, the influence of possible electrochemical active interferes such as organic compounds and metal ions were also evaluated by adding these species to BPA solution under optimal experimental conditions. The results indicated that 50-fold amount of hydroxyphenol, dopamine, 4-nitrophenol, hydroxyphenol, ethanol and 100-fold concentration of Mg 2+ , Al 3+ , Ca 2+ , Pb 2+ , SO 4 2-, Cl - and NO 3 -had little influence on the oxidation signal of bisphenol A, and the change in the peak current was less than 5%.To evaluate the modified electrodes' reproducibility, ten sensors (Cu@TU-PMO-IL/GCE) were prepared in the same way and were all used for the detection of 1 µM BPA solution.

        <p>In order to evaluate the Cu@TU-PMO-IL/GCE performance for practical applications, the sensor was applied to detect BPA in PVC food packages, PC baby bottles, and PC water bottles. All samples were obtained from the local market. The samples collected were simply centrifuged to remove impurities. The food packages, PC baby bottles, and PC water bottles were first pre-cleaned, dried and cut into small pieces, respectively. Then 1.0 g of plastic samples (PC baby bottles and water bottles, or poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) food packages) was first soaked in a flask containing 100 mL of doubly distilled water for 60 min at 70 • C and cooled at room temperature. After cooling, the water-leach liquor sample was filtered and collected. A standard addition method was used to evaluate the analytical performance of the sensor. The designed sensors were successfully applied to the determination of BPA in food storage container and mineral water and baby bottles samples with different brand with SWV technique were compared with the HPLC technique. The statistical comparison of SWV analysis results with HPLC analysis results was achieved using the t-test and F-test. It can be concluded from Table 1 that there is no significant difference between the results obtained by the two methods for P &gt; 0.05. as in all cases, the calculated t-values and F-values are lower than the t-value and F-value of 2.92 and 19 expected at a P = 0.05 and n = 3. The official method showed that there is no significant difference between the proposed and reported methods as indicated from the F-test and t-test values. In addition, the recoveries of BPA achieved from the proposed sensor were in the range of 93.86-108.66%, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was found ranging from 1.38% to 4.29%. This satisfactory result indicated the well accuracy and reliability of the fabricated Cu@TU- t-value at P = 0.02 and 2 degrees of freedom is 2.92.
