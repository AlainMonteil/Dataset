        <p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection affects one third of the world's population, about two billion people, making the current control of tuberculosis an extremely difficult task. It is estimated that 10 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) appear every year and that about 1.5 million people die as a direct consequence of the disease [1]. The World Health Organization has described the increasing microbial resistance to antibiotics as one of the main risks for human health. It has also anticipated the entry of a post-antibiotic era in which common infections could lead to death. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that no new type of antibiotic has been marketed in the last 25 years to which pathogenic microorganisms have not developed resistance. In the case of TB, of the 10 million infections per year, an estimated 500.000 are infections with antibiotic-resistant strains of Mtb; in fact, about 80 countries have reported cases of infection with extremely antibiotic-resistant strains [2]. This implies that existing therapeutic strategies for TB will be less effective in the coming years. In this sense, nanomaterials are currently proving to be a promising alternative as antimicrobial therapeutics including Mtb infection treatment [3][4][5].Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection affects one third of the world's population, about two billion people, making the current control of tuberculosis an extremely difficult task.

        <p>The antibacterial effect of silver-based nanomaterials has been widely evaluated and described in several studies [6][7][8][9]. Their effects are based on the disturbance of bacterial metabolic processes [10][11][12], the interaction with the DNA of the bacteria [13] or the increase of the cytoplasmic membrane permeability [14,15]. Due to this range of effects, these silverbased nanosystems are effective on both sensitive and highly resistant strains [16,17]. It is important to emphasize that their antibacterial effects, as well as other properties, depend on the particle morphology and its surface characteristics [18,19]. Some authors argue that the main antibacterial mechanism of silver-based nanosystems is due to progressive oxidation to ionic silver (Ag + ), while others propose a synergistic effect between the direct interaction of the nanomaterials with the bacterial cell and the released of Ag + ions [8,20]. Previous studies have tested the activity of several nanomaterials, specifically Ag and AgBr nanoparticles (AgNPs and AgBrNPs), in different types of bacteria [21]. In general, it has been demonstrated that there are differences in antibacterial activity that arise from the differential interaction of silver-based materials with the cell walls of microorganisms. In the case of Gram-positive bacteria, it has been observed greater sensitivity to AgNPs, probably due to the destructive interaction of these materials with cell walls. However, Gram-negative bacteria and yeast strains exhibited greater sensitivity to AgBrNPs due to the combination of the direct interaction of the NPs with the cell walls and the simultaneous release of Ag + able to penetrate into the cells [21]. These differences J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f shown in the antibacterial activity as a function of the nanomaterial used may provide a basis for the development of selective targeted antibacterial nanosystems for a specific strain type. Also, Ag/AgBr nanostructures have been reported with an enhanced antibacterial activity due to photodynamic effects and the innate antimicrobial ability of Ag + [22]. Furthermore, AgNPs alone or in combination with biomolecules have good antimycobacterial effects and are promising future therapeutics for TB because overcome the current antibiotic resistance [23].The antibacterial effect of silver-based nanomaterials has been widely evaluated and described in several studies [6][7][8][9].

        <p>Despite the bactericidal potential of AgNPs and AgBrNPs, it is necessary to take into account their high toxicity [24][25][26], which makes their use in biomedical applications limited. Therefore, it is required their carrying in another vehicle to allow a more selective administration, as in the case of cancer-cell targeting [27,28]. This strategy avoids systemic exposure to metal nanoparticles, as well as prevents the aggregation problems associated to uncoated AgNPs and AgBrNPs [29]. In this context, the use of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as carriers has attracted the nanomedicine scientists due to their biocompatibility and unique properties, such as particle diameters in the 50-200 nm range, highly ordered pore network with narrow pore size distributions of 3-6 nm and silanol rich surface that allows their functionalization. MSNs represent a versatile nanoplatform able to be combined with organic and inorganic moieties for biomedical applications, such as cancer and infection treatment [30][31][32][33][34][35][36]. Aimed at TB treatment, MSNs have been reported as delivery vehicles of antimicrobial agents against mycobacterium Mtb such as the antimycobacterial peptide NZX [37], the water insoluble antibiotic clofazimine [38] or the antibiotic isoniazid [39][40][41]. The major form of TB disease is manifested in the pulmonary form and MSNs have been also investigated for aerosol delivery representing an efficient strategy for respiratory-based therapeutics [42].Despite the bactericidal potential of AgNPs and AgBrNPs, it is necessary to take into account their high toxicity [24][25][26], which makes their use in biomedical applications limited.

        <p>However, to the best of our knowledge, MSNs as carriers of silver with antimycobacterial activity against Mtb have not yet been reported. MSNs containing silver would overcome the aggregation problems of AgNPs and would present advantages such as the possibility of functionalization to increase local availability, even macrophage internalization, and the combination with other anti-TB drugs allocated into the mesopores for a synergic antimycotic activity. Based on these premises, in this work two different mesoporous silica-silver hybrid nanosystems with potential antimycobacterial effect against Mtb have been designed and tested. While one of the nanosystems consists of AgBr nanoparticles supported on the MSNs network, the other consists of MSNs containing an Ag core in a core@shell configuration.However, to the best of our knowledge, MSNs as carriers of silver with antimycobacterial activity against Mtb have not yet been reported.

        <p>A one-pot route for the incorporation on silver ions followed by a thermal treatment was followed for the incorporation of silver bromide in the MSNs framework [43].

The resulting solution was added dropwise at a constant rate (1.5 mL/min) over the solution containing TEOS and CTAB. Then, the remaining solution of TEOS was also added at constant rate of 0.8 mL/min. The reaction was stirred at 75 C for 2 h. Then, nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol.

        <p>The synthesis of mesoporous silica nanoparticles containing supported silver bromide nanoparticles (MSNs-AgBrNPs) was carried out in a one-pot route for the incorporation on silver ions followed by a thermal treatment (Figure 1A). Organic-inorganic hybrid mesoporous silica nanoparticles were initially formed by co-condensation of the silica precursor TEOS and the alkoxysilane TSD which contains both primary and secondary amine functional groups as anchorage points for the complexation of Ag + ions. The co-condensation was performed in the presence of CTAB as structure directing agent. Also, silver nitrate was present during the sol-gel reactions, therefore affording the complexation of Ag + ions in the amino groups attached to the silica framework. Finally, the thermal treatment affords the removal of the organic surfactant and the formation of AgBrNPs simultaneously in the same step.The synthesis of mesoporous silica nanoparticles containing supported silver bromide nanoparticles (MSNs-AgBrNPs) was carried out in a one-pot route for the incorporation on silver ions followed by a thermal treatment (Figure 1A).

        <p>The preparation of core@shell nanoparticles (Ag@MSNs) was performed in a two-stage process (Figure 1B). The silver nanoparticles that form the core of the final material were prepared in the first step. For this purpose, the ionic precursor AgNO3 underwent a chemical reduction process with sodium borohydride according to the following reaction: The obtained AgNPs were characterized by TEM and UV-visible spectroscopy. The TEM micrographs showed a homogeneous dispersion of AgNPs with a diameter of ca. 14 nm (Figure S1A andS1D). The UV-visible spectrum (Figure S1C) showed a maximum absorbance peak at 408 nm which corresponds to the plasmon band of silver nanoparticles smaller than 20 nm, thus confirming the diameter observed by TEM [46]. In a second step, the AgNPs stabilized with CTAB were coated via hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS as silica source. The surfactant CTAB acts as stabilizing agent to prevent the silver TEM of the final material showed core@shell nanoparticles with a homogeneous diameter of ca. 77 nm (Figure S1B and S1D). The shift of the maximum plasmon peak to 421 nm, as well as the increase of its full width at half maximum, observed in the UV-visible spectra of the Ag@MSNs material (Figure S1C) maybe ascribed to the mesoporous silica coating observed in the TEM study.The preparation of core@shell nanoparticles (Ag@MSNs) was performed in a two-stage process (Figure 1B).

        <p>The incorporation of silver in the mesoporous silica nanoparticles was first assessed by TEM. The elemental analysis of materials was performed by EDX. The spectrum of Ag@MSNs only presented signals corresponding to Si and Ag (Figure 2D). However, the MSNs-AgBrNPs material also presented a signal corresponding to Br in its EDX spectrum, pointing out to the possibility of AgBr as inorganic nanoparticles in this material (Figure 2C). The atomic percentages are shown in Table S1, and their analysis indicates a molar ratio Ag/Si of 0.0317 for MSNs-AgBrNPs and 0.0342 for Ag@MSNs, thus being comparable the amount of silver incorporated in both silica-based nanosystems. The low content in Br found in the Ag@MSNs material could be due to residues of the surfactant CTAB used in the stabilization of AgNPs and later as template of the mesostructure of the silica since this material has not been subjected to a thermal treatment for the removal of the surfactant.The incorporation of silver in the mesoporous silica nanoparticles was first assessed by TEM.

Figure 3B shows the diffractograms obtained for both materials where a different pattern can be observed for each one. While the Ag@MSNs material exhibits the pattern corresponding to metallic silver with a face-centered cubic structure (JCPDS, No.4-0783), the MSNs-AgBrNPs material shows a pattern indexed to the cubic structure of AgBr (JCPDS, No. 06-0438). XRD maxima, lattice spacing and hkl indexes of diffractograms for each material are listed in Table 1. These results, together with the absence of maxima due to crystalline impurities, confirm the presence of different pure crystalline phases in each nanosystem, Ag 0 nanoparticles in the Ag@MSNs material and AgBr nanoparticles in the case of the MSNs-AgBrNPs material.The nature of the silver based nanoparticles present in the materials was further studied by high angle X-ray diffraction.

These results, together with the absence of maxima due to crystalline impurities, confirm the presence of different pure crystalline phases in each nanosystem, Ag 0 nanoparticles in the Ag@MSNs material and AgBr nanoparticles in the case of the MSNs-AgBrNPs material.</p>
        <p>Regarding the mesoporous structure, the results obtained in the low angle region of the XRD measurements (Figure 3A and Table S3) agree with the TEM studies. The MSNs-AgBrNPs material presents a pattern referable to the MCM-41 structure with a 2D-hexagonal plane array of pores with p6mm symmetry (Figure S3). The diffraction maxima can be indexed as The textural properties of mesoporous silica nanoparticles were studied by N2 sorption analysis (Figure 4 and Table 2). The curves for both materials exhibit a type IV Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption-desorption isotherms with no observed hysteresis loop, confirming the mesoporous structure of materials exhibiting cylindrical pores. The N2 isotherms of MSNs-AgBrNPs and Ag@MSNs present an inflection at a relative pressure of 0.18-0.30 and 0.20-0.40, respectively, which corresponds to the phenomena of capillary condensation and evaporation within channel-type mesopores. Neither curve shows a very sharp increase, as expected due to the loss of uniformity of the cylindrical channels with respect to a typical MCM-41 type mesoporous structure. The secondary step observed at a pressure above 0.90 P/P0 is attributed to interparticle N2 condensation and the high amount of adsorbed N2 in this region for the Ag@MSNs material reveals the smaller size of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f core@shell nanosystem. Due to this difference in the interparticle condensation, pore volume has been also calculated at P/P0 = 0.60 for comparison of both materials. The nanosystems possess high surface area and pore volume values (Table 2), although are lower for the MSNs-AgBrNPs material, maybe reflecting a partial blocking of the mesopores due to the presence of AgBrNPs in the silica framework. For the core@shell nanosystem, the AgNPs are in the central core thus being the mesopores unrestricted. Pore diameter is around 2.5 nm for both materials, while is higher for the Ag@MSNs material, also consistent with the interplanar distance obtained for the XRD lattice spacing of the ( 10) reflection (Table S3). The -potential of MSNs-AgBrNPs and Ag@MSNs materials presents a negative value of approximately 19 mV in both cases, high enough to be within the colloidal stability zone (Table 2). This value is due to the presence of negatively charged silanol groups (-Si-O  )Regarding the mesoporous structure, the results obtained in the low angle region of the XRD measurements (Figure 3A and Table S3) agree with the TEM studies.

        <p>The hydrodynamic size was obtained by dynamic light scattering measurements showing monomodal distributions for both MSNs-AgBrNPs and Ag@MSNs, which indicates the presence of only one population of nanoparticles and therefore discarding the occurrence of free silver based NPs (Figure S4). The maximum of the distribution is ca. 90 nm for the Ag@MSNs material and ca. 245 nm for MSNs-AgBrNPs (Table 2) confirming the smaller size for the Ag@MSNs nanosystem, as above concluded in TEM and N2 adsorption characterization.The hydrodynamic size was obtained by dynamic light scattering measurements showing monomodal distributions for both MSNs-AgBrNPs and Ag@MSNs, which indicates the presence of only one population of nanoparticles and therefore discarding the occurrence of free silver based NPs (Figure S4).

        <p>In order to evaluate the antimycobacterial properties of the materials against Mtb, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured at days 4, 14 and 20 after treatment with serial suspensions of MSNs-AgBrNPs and Ag@MSNs nanosystems, starting from an initial concentration of 500 g/mL of each material. The results obtained showed an inhibition of bacterial growth by the effect of both materials (Figure 5). The value of MIC of the evaluated materials can be defined as the minimum concentration that inhibits the visible growth of the evaluated microorganism. For all the time points evaluated, MSNs-AgBrNPs exhibited a more effective antimycobacterial effect as compared to Ag@MSNs (Figure 5).In order to evaluate the antimycobacterial properties of the materials against Mtb, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured at days 4, 14 and 20 after treatment with serial suspensions of MSNs-AgBrNPs and Ag@MSNs nanosystems, starting from an initial concentration of 500 g/mL of each material.

        <p>After 20 days (Figure 5C), the MIC value for the MSNs-AgBrNPs material was 31.25 g/mL, while for the Ag@MSNs material it was 250 g/mL. Further, we found that MSNs-AgBrNPs truly compromise bacterial viability as determined by the resazurin test (Figure S5 in Supplementary Material). Using this test, we could measure that MSNs-AgBrNPs affect bacterial viability at a concentration of 15 g/mL.After 20 days (Figure 5C), the MIC value for the MSNs-AgBrNPs material was 31.25 g/mL, while for the Ag@MSNs material it was 250 g/mL.

        <p>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Since both materials have similar Ag content with respect to Si, the more accentuated mycobactericidal effect against Mtb observed for MSNs-AgBrNPs could be explained by the presence of AgBrNPs distributed throughout the silica network and the mesoporous channels and therefore more exposed to the media, compared to the Ag core present in Ag@MSNs.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Since both materials have similar Ag content with respect to Si, the more accentuated mycobactericidal effect against Mtb observed for MSNs-AgBrNPs could be explained by the presence of AgBrNPs distributed throughout the silica network and the mesoporous channels and therefore more exposed to the media, compared to the Ag core present in Ag@MSNs.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the release of Ag + ions, capable of penetrating the mycobacterial membrane [21,47] and possibly responsible for the mycobactericidal action, might be faster from AgBrNPs than from Ag cores, where such release depends on the previous oxidation of Ag 0 to Ag + [48]. A silver and silicon release experiment was carried out under the Mtb culture J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f conditions to try to justify the different behavior of both materials. The concentration of the elements was determined in the solution at different times up to 28 days by ICP-AES. Silver and bromine were not detected in the release medium, getting values lower than the detection limit of the equipment for all times recorded. However, silicon presented concentrations from 47 to 346 mg/L and 23 to 261 mg/L for MSN-AgBrNPs and Ag@MSNs, respectively (see Table S2 in Supplementary material). On the other hand, the solids recovered after 5 days of immersion in the culture medium were analyzed by TEM and EDS (Figure S6 and Table S1). The TEM images confirm the silica degradation in both samples, as expected for mesoporous silica nanoparticles in aqueous media [49]. Regarding the silver, in the MSN-AgBrNPs material, the AgBr nanoparticles have suffered a reorganization and are found in agglomerates independent from the MSNs themselves. However, the Ag@MSNs material preserves the Ag core surrounded by the degraded mesoporous silica shell. Consistent with these images, the corresponding EDS analyses confirm a six-and seven-fold increase in the Ag/Si molar ratio with respect to the initial materials, due to the fact that the amount of silver is maintained and the silicon is leached into the medium.Furthermore, the release of Ag + ions, capable of penetrating the mycobacterial membrane [21,47] and possibly responsible for the mycobactericidal action, might be faster from AgBrNPs than from Ag cores, where such release depends on the previous oxidation of Ag 0 to Ag + [48].

        <p>However, we cannot discard silver release in the antimycobacterial activity assay, although in the Mtb culture medium in the absence of the mycobacteria, silver could be oxidizing and reducing not being detected as soluble Ag + neither short nor long times assayed.However, we cannot discard silver release in the antimycobacterial activity assay, although in the Mtb culture medium in the absence of the mycobacteria, silver could be oxidizing and reducing not being detected as soluble Ag + neither short nor long times assayed.</p>
        <p>Based on the better effective antimycobacterial effect of MSNs-AgBrNPs, the interaction of this nanosystem with Mtb was further analyzed attending to the fact that nanoparticles can compromise the integrity of bacterial membranes [21].Based on the better effective antimycobacterial effect of MSNs-AgBrNPs, the interaction of this nanosystem with Mtb was further analyzed attending to the fact that nanoparticles can compromise the integrity of bacterial membranes [21].</p>
        <p>To gain insight into the nature of the inhibitory effect of MSNs-AgBrNPs, a study in a closeto-native state of the morphological changes in the surface of Mtb after treatment with MSNs-AgBrNPs was carried out by cryo-EM.

        <p>However, Mtb cells treated with MSNs-AgBrNPs presented membrane damage, as seen in Figure 6B. In addition, nanoparticles can be observed in direct contact with the Mtb cell membrane, which suggests the mycobactericidal effect and the damage detected in the bacterial envelope may be also related to the direct interaction between Mtb and the nanosystem. These results agree with previous studies which show that nanoparticles can influence the bacterial cell wall by direct contact without the need to be endocytosed [50,51].However, Mtb cells treated with MSNs-AgBrNPs presented membrane damage, as seen in Figure 6B.
