        <p>The release, accidental or premeditated, of toxic metals to the environment as a result of industrialization continues to be a cause for global concern due to the impact on the environment and the health of living organisms [1]. For instance, trace amounts of metals like copper, iron, and zinc are essential for metabolism in all living organisms; excess amounts of these essential metals are capable of overwhelming the homeostatic mechanism, i.e. the ability to regulate complex metabolic equilibria, of an organism [2,3]. The toxicity of cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, and zinc vary. While some are lethal even in small concentrations, others are lethal from bioaccumulation; toxic effects range from disruption of the nervous system to carcinogenic potentials [4][5][6].The release, accidental or premeditated, of toxic metals to the environment as a result of industrialization continues to be a cause for global concern due to the impact on the environment and the health of living organisms [1].

        <p>Adsorption is one of the effective means of the removal of these toxic metals in solutions via the use of adsorbents [5][6][7]. As far back as 1884, when Venable collected rudimentary data on zinc contamination [8], advances have been made in the detection, quantification, and removal of toxic metals from drinking water. Among a plethora of inorganic waste materials for purifying water contaminated with toxic metals, coal fly ash and zeolites prepared from coal fly ash have been widely used [9][10][11][12][13][14]. There is an appreciable amount of literature available on the preparation of synthetic zeolites from coal fly ash [12][13][14][15][16][17][18].Adsorption is one of the effective means of the removal of these toxic metals in solutions via the use of adsorbents [5][6][7].

        <p>Coal fly ash, powdered particulate matter generated as a combustion by-product in thermal power stations that utilize pulverised coal, is mainly composed of oxides of silicon and aluminium. Pulverized coal is fed into dry bottom boilers, most commonly used in thermal power stations, and approximately 80% of all its ash is fly ash conveyed by flue gases [19]. In accordance with ASTM C618, fly ash falls into two broad classes -C and F [20] . This classification is based on the total amount of oxides of silicon, aluminium, and iron present. Class C fly ash is obtained from the combustion of geologically younger sub-bituminous or lignite coal while class F is obtained from much older bituminous or anthracite coal. According to ASTM C618 classification, the sum of SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 is up to 50% for class C and 70% for class F [20] . The chemical composition of coal fly ash (CFA) varies with geographical location and the coal source but the commonality is the predominance of SiO2 and Al2O3.Coal fly ash, powdered particulate matter generated as a combustion by-product in thermal power stations that utilize pulverised coal, is mainly composed of oxides of silicon and aluminium.

        <p>Due to the close semblance in terms of composition of CFA to volcanic materials, fly ash can be used to synthesize zeolites. Zeolites are 3D aluminosilicate frameworks with porous crystalline structures that have wide ranging usage in the fields of adsorption, catalysis, and ion exchange [18,[21][22][23][24][25][26]. Zeolite types from CFA include Linde type A zeolite (LTA), FAU-types (zeolite X, Y), zeolite P, and chabazite [1,14,[27][28][29]. To synthesize zeolites from CFA, the conventional methods involve the use of alkaline solutions to dissolve the varied crystalline phases and the subsequent precipitation of zeolite phases via hydrothermal treatment, whereas unconventional methods include dry or molten salt conversion and microwave assisted synthesis [29][30][31][32]. The hydrothermal method for CFA synthesis typically involves heating CFA in NaOH solutions at autogenous pressures using a temperature range of 80 -200 °C and a time period of 3 to 96 h [21,29,33,34]. With the variations in alkali concentrations, solid to liquid mass ratio, type of CFA, synthesis temperature and time, the yields of zeolitic materials, including zeolite A, Na-P1, and hydroxysodalite, were reported to be between 20 -65 wt % of CFA [33][34][35] .Due to the close semblance in terms of composition of CFA to volcanic materials, fly ash can be used to synthesize zeolites.

        <p>An improvement on the hydrothermal method is the inclusion of an alkaline fusion step prior to the hydrothermal treatment developed by Shigemoto et al. [36] . In this method, CFA is mixed with various mass ratios of CFA to solid NaOH and the product is fused at temperatures ranging from 400 -750 °C; this converts most of the crystalline CFA phases into soluble aluminosilicates, which are then dissolved in distilled water and subsequently crystallized into zeolites via hydrothermal synthesis [16,33,[36][37][38][39].An improvement on the hydrothermal method is the inclusion of an alkaline fusion step prior to the hydrothermal treatment developed by Shigemoto et al.

Proceeding with hydrothermal treatment at 80°C, the intermediate amorphous phases reorganized and zeolite nucleation with crystal growth occurred within the treatment duration.

        <p>The XRD patterns of samples CFZ4 and CFZ10 with different ageing times and the reference zeolite (ZRef-FAU) are shown in Fig. 3 while the corresponding SEM images are shown in Fig. 4. With a water content of 1:4, the end product formed with 24 h of ageing was mainly a mixed phase that includes FAU (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4a). An extended ageing duration of up to 72 h resulted in a mixture of FAU and LTA zeolites (Fig. 4 a-d). A higher water content of 1:10 and 24 h ageing resulted in a more defined All CFA zeolites had a Si/Al ratio of about 2.5, which is comparable to the Si/Al ratio of the raw CFA (Table 1). Surface areas, external surface areas and micropore volumes increased with an increase of ageing time up to 68 h for both CFZ4 and CFZ10 zeolites. Further increase of the ageing time resulted in a slight reduction of the micropore volume in both type of samples, which could be due to an increased amount of LTA-type zeolite in the samples as seen in the XRD patterns (Fig. 3).

        <p>In a series of experiments, the water content was increased even further using the optimised 68 h of ageing, in an attempt to increase the phase purity of the FAU-type zeolites. The results shown in Fig. 5 indicate that when a ratio of 15 was used, the FAU phase purity indeed increases. However, further increase of the ratio to 20 resulted in a disordered material. These results were also confirmed by the surface area and micropore volume results obtained (Table 2). XRD of the precursor samples prior to being subjected to hydrothermal treatment were very similar (Fig. 5a) indicating that minor variations in the chemical composition of the precursor mixture have a significant influence on the zeolite crystallization during the hydrothermal step. With an increment in water content from 1:4 to 1:20 ratios, within the same ageing duration of 68 h, the result showed that FAU zeolite was formed up until 1:15 (CFZ4-68, CFZ10-68, and CFZ15-68). Beyond that, the product was predominantly amorphous (CFZ20-68), as shown on the XRD patterns in Fig. 5b. As shown on Fig. 5a, for all the water additions of 1:4, 1:10, 1:15, and 1: 20 (CFA4-68, CFA10-68, CFA15-68, and CFA20-68, respectively), the XRD patterns for the samples prior to hydrothermal treatment (where the samples were filtered and washed after ageing) showed that the amorphous signatures appeared the same irrespective of the amount of water added. Hydrothermal treatment re-introduced crystallinity via zeolitization making FAU the dominant phase from a water ratio of 10 to 15 (CFZ10-68 and CFZ15-68) with a subsequent increase in Si/Al ratio and surface area shown on Table 2. For the prepared zeolites, Fig. 5b shows the amorphous structure of CFZ20-68 is similar to its pre-hydrothermal treatment stage as seen on the XRD pattern of CFA20-68 (Fig. 5a) with a surface area of 27 m 2 /g (Table 2) compared to CFZ15-68, which has a surface area of 465 m 2 /g.In a series of experiments, the water content was increased even further using the optimised 68 h of ageing, in an attempt to increase the phase purity of the FAU-type zeolites.

With an increment in water content from 1:4 to 1:20 ratios, within the same ageing duration of 68 h, the result showed that FAU zeolite was formed up until 1:15 (CFZ4-68, CFZ10-68, and CFZ15-68). Beyond that, the product was predominantly amorphous (CFZ20-68), as shown on the XRD patterns in Fig. 5b. As shown on Fig. 5a, for all the water additions of 1:4, 1:10, 1:15, and 1: 20 (CFA4-68, CFA10-68, CFA15-68, and CFA20-68, respectively), the XRD patterns for the samples prior to hydrothermal treatment (where the samples were filtered and washed after ageing) showed that the amorphous signatures appeared the same irrespective of the amount of water added. Hydrothermal treatment re-introduced crystallinity via zeolitization making FAU the dominant phase from a water ratio of 10 to 15 (CFZ10-68 and CFZ15-68) with a subsequent increase in Si/Al ratio and surface area shown on Table 2. For the prepared zeolites, Fig. 5b shows the amorphous structure of CFZ20-68 is similar to its pre-hydrothermal treatment stage as seen on the XRD pattern of CFA20-68 (Fig. 5a) with a surface area of 27 m 2 /g (Table 2) compared to CFZ15-68, which has a surface area of 465 m 2 /g.</p>
        <p>Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of CFZ10-68, CFZ15-68, and ZRef-FAU are shown in Fig. 6a and corresponding BJH (Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda) adsorption pore-size distributions are included in Fig. 6b. The isotherm of the reference sample displays a typical type I isotherm characteristic of microporous materials. The micropore volume of this sample (0.303 cm 3 /g, Table 1) confirms the fully crystalline zeolite FAU nature of the sample (Fig. 2). The shape of the isotherms of CFZ10-68 and CFZ15-68 is different in comparison with the reference zeolite. The isotherms contain a hysteresis loop, however, due to the absence of a plateau at high relative pressures they can be classified as type IIb isotherms rather than type IV isotherms [45,46]. The type H3 hysteresis loops in both samples suggest the presence of slit-shaped pores. The steep increase in the volume of gas adsorbed at low relative pressures is indicative of microporosity, and corresponding micropore volumes of 0.172 and 0.194 cm 3 /g, Table 2, were determined, which are lower compared to the micropore volume of the reference zeolite sample in accordance to XRD results (Fig. 3). The BJH pore-size distributions further confirm the similar pore structures of CFZ10-68 and CFZ15-68 (Fig. 3b). With a surface area of 2 m 2 /g and well-defined crystalline phases (Fig. 1a) consisting of aluminosilicates albeit not in the same ordering as FAU zeolite, adsorption was possible even in the presence of a myriad of impurities in the untreated fly ash.Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of CFZ10-68, CFZ15-68, and ZRef-FAU are shown in Fig. 6a and corresponding BJH (Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda) adsorption pore-size distributions are included in Fig. 6b.

        <p>Transformation of CFA to FAU zeolite lead to the restructuring of the constituent crystalline phases and a major enhancement of the adsorption experiment results of the untreated fly ash; even though CFZ15-68 had the highest surface area of 465 m 2 /g, CFZ10-68 was used instead in consideration of a lesser amount of water for synthesis . While the quantity of adsorption on CFA was limited below 100 mg/L, FAU zeolite from fly ash (CFZ10-068) had a removal efficiency of almost 100% at 100 mg/L (Fig. 8a). A better comparison is with the reference FAU zeolite, ZRef-FAU shown in Fig. 8b. While Comparing the prepared fly ash FAU zeolite with the reference sample shown in Fig. 9 a and b, within 10 minutes there was more than 99% removal of Pb(II) for both adsorbents at 200 mg/L. Cu(II) and Cd(II) removal were higher for the fly ash FAU zeolite than the reference zeolite. Just as in Fig. 8a, there is a wider separation in the adsorption trend curves between the first three preferentially adsorbed metals (Pb(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II)) and the least adsorbed metals -Co(II) and Zn(II). With the exception of Pb(II), the gap is fairly consistent with the other four metals in the case of the reference zeolite.Transformation of CFA to FAU zeolite lead to the restructuring of the constituent crystalline phases and a major enhancement of the adsorption experiment results of the untreated fly ash; even though CFZ15-68 had the highest surface area of 465 m 2 /g, CFZ10-68 was used instead in consideration of a lesser amount of water for synthesis .

        <p>In assessing the efficiency at 200 mg/L and 90 mins duration for three different adsorbent loadings -5, 10, and 15 g/L shown on Fig. 10, Pb(II) had an optimal removal at the lowest adsorbent loading of 5 g/L. The more noticeable changes in efficiency were Co(II) and Zn(II); doubling the initial adsorbent loading to 10 g/L led to more than a 50% increment in Co(II) removal and about a 30% increment in Zn(II). These results are logical since increasing the amount of adsorbents provides extra active sites for adsorption even in the most competitive and selective environment. Tripling the loading had no noticeable effect on Zn(II) since twice the initial loading provided sufficient adsorption active sites needed for its removal while Co(II) had about an 8% increment from the previous 50%. Table 3 shows the EDAX elemental analysis of prepared FAU zeolite, CFZ10-68, before and after adsorption for the three zeolite loadings used in Fig. 11. The semi-quantitative results show that all five metals were simultaneously removed from solutions. Similar levels of each metal were measured in filtered and dried zeolite samples independently of the zeolite loading used for adsorption. These levels decreased with an increase in the zeolite loading from 5 g/L to 15 g/L due to the increased number of surface sites available for adsorption.In assessing the efficiency at 200 mg/L and 90 mins duration for three different adsorbent loadings -5, 10, and 15 g/L shown on Fig. 10, Pb(II) had an optimal removal at the lowest adsorbent loading of 5 g/L.

        <p>Though the data was tested on five kinetic models, only the best two (second-order and pseudo secondorder) are presented on Table 4 for an initial concentration of 200 mg/L; pseudo second-order had the best fitting followed by second-order. The rate constants (k2, kPSO, and kid) are indicators of how fast adsorption occurs; the higher the value, the faster the adsorption. From the correlation factor, R 2 , the pseudo second-order kinetic model had the best fit for all five heavy metals; this is an indication of chemosorption in contrast to physiosorption as the driving mechanism for the adsorption [1,41].Though the data was tested on five kinetic models, only the best two (second-order and pseudo secondorder) are presented on Table 4 for an initial concentration of 200 mg/L; pseudo second-order had the best fitting followed by second-order.

        <p>Equilibrium sorption capacity values, qe, obtained from the pseudo second-order model fitting (Table 4) were comparable to the experimental values at 200 mg/L. The experimental values were 39.965 mg/g, 39.008 mg/g, 38.906 mg/g, 31.615 mg/g, and 16.400 mg/g for Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), and Co(II) respectively.

        <p>Data fitting using the intraparticle diffusion model yielded a linear correlation (Table 4) with the trend in diffusion rate as Co(II) &gt; Zn(II) &gt; Pb(II) &gt; Cd(II) &gt; Cu(II). Adsorption for a concentration range of 100 mg/L to 500 mg/L on CFZ10-68 had the best fitting with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and the isotherm parameters are shown on Table 5. The model/theoretical values were compared with the actual experimental values and the difference was within ±2% which is reasonable except in the case of Co(II) that gave an underestimation of the actual value. For instance, in applying the model to Cu(II), the theoretical qmax is 57.803 mg/g, while the actual experimental value obtained was 58.024 mg/g; well within the tolerance limit. The maximum amount of metals adsorbed on FAU zeolite prepared from coal fly ash had the trend Pb(II) &gt; Cu(II) &gt; Cd(II) &gt; Zn(II) &gt; Co(II). Table 6 shows the Langmuir parameters, qmax and KL, for the reference material, ZRef-FAU with the trend in maximum adsorption amounts as follows: Pb(II) &gt; Cd(II) &gt; Cu(II) &gt; Zn(II) &gt; Co(II). In comparing the maximum amounts adsorbed, qmax, CFZ10-68 (Table 5 and Fig. 8a) and ZRef-FAU (Table 6 and Fig. 8b) had approximately similar amounts for Cu(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II).
