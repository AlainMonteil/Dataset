        <p>mechanism studies including steady state photolysis, fluorescence quenching measurements, electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping experiments and cyclic voltammetry. Markedly, their excellent photochemical reactivities prompted us to investigate the performance of these multi-component photoinitiating systems upon sunlight as an ecofriendly approach. As a result, this research proved that sunlight could be used as a potential light source that can advantageously replace LEDs when highly reactive push-pull dyes are used as photosensitizers for the free radical photopolymerization of acrylate resins. Finally, 3D patterns could be prepared with the new photocomposites, and silica fillers could be even incorporated within the photosensitive resins so that a gradient of resolution could be successfully demonstrated.</p>
        <p>In recent years, a wide range of push-pull dyes differing by the electron-donating or the electron-accepting groups have been investigated in various applications and reported for their attractive features such as high molar extinction coefficients, strong light absorption in the visible range and the tunability of the absorption spectra. [1][2][3][4][5][6] In fact, contrarily to numerous dyes for which their absorption spectra are difficult to tune, push-pull dyes have been extensively studied as visible light sensitive photoinitiators of polymerization due to their excellent photoinitiation abilities. [7][8][9][10][11] Indeed, due to the presence of the π-conjugated spacer introduced between the electron donor and the electron acceptor, but also by the possibility to finely tune the electron-donating and electron-accepting abilities of both the donor and the acceptor, position of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band can be carefully controlled. 12 By elongating the length of the π-conjugated spacer, a significant increase of the molar extinction coefficients can also be achieved. [13][14][15] Benefiting from these different advantages, pushpull dyes have been investigated in a wide range of applications ranging from Organic Electronics, e.g. organic photovoltaics (OPVs), 16,17 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), 18 organic-field effects transistors (OFETs) 19 to nonlinear optics (NLO) [20][21][22][23][24][25][26] and waste-water treatment. 27 Recently, sunlight-induced photopolymerization has attracted the interest of chemists and polymerists, and intense efforts are currently devoted to this research field. [28][29][30][31] Using sunlight to initiate a photopolymerization process is attracting increasing attentions due to the numerous advantages. For instance, the emission spectrum of the Sun is relatively broad so that it is well adapted to panchromatic photoinitiators. At least, polymerization reactions can be carried out at room temperature, and the replacement of LEDs by Sunlight can avoid the use of artificial energy. 32 Sunlight is also a free and unlimited light source and constitutes an unlimited resource on Earth. Even if some papers were noticeably devoted to this topic, the reported systems don't exhibit very high reactivity. [33][34][35] Indeed, Free radical polymerization under sunlight still remains a challenge due to the low light intensity requiring extremely efficient systems. Moreover, preparation of polymer composites containing fillers is another active research field so that the combination of the two topics and the development of new photoinitiating systems that could both address the polymerization under sunlight and the polymerization of resins containing fillers could constitute a major breakthrough in photopolymerization.</p>
        <p>Here, in this article, a new series of push-pull dyes, never reported before, (Figure 1) and containing the N-ethyl carbazole-1-allylidene moiety as the electron-donating group have been used as photoinitiators with co-initiators, i.e. an iodonium salt and a tertiary amine (ethyl dimethylaminobenzoate EDB), to initiate the FRP of a benchmark acrylate monomer, TA. As a result, three-component photoinitiating systems comprising dyes 3, 6, 7, 8 furnished high final acrylate function conversions.</p>
        <p>Infrared spectroscopy (RT-FTIR), and the new photoinitiating systems were successfully applied to the elaboration of 3D patterns with excellent spatial resolutions by the direct laser write (DLW) approach. Photopolymerization was also successfully induced by sunlight in short photo-activation times and it proved to be an efficient approach to replace the energy-consuming LEDs. The photochemical properties and the chemical mechanisms of the selected push-pull dyes were investigated by photolysis and fluorescence measurements. The use of electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping technique further confirmed the proposed mechanisms. Finally, 3D patterns obtained with silica-containing composites demonstrated the usability of the novel push-pull dyes in practical composites applications.</p>
        <p>Molecular structures of investigated dyes 1-12 based on a push-pull structure in this article are depicted in the Figure 1. The synthesis procedures are reported in Section 3.1 and their characterization reported in supporting information.</p>
        <p>A commercial iodonium salt (Iod -Speedcure 938) and an amine (ethyl dimethylaminobenzoate -EDB) were used as co-initiators in this article. Their corresponding chemical structures are given in Scheme 1. These different chemicals were purchased from Lambson Ltd (UK). The benchmark acrylate monomer (TA) was purchased from Allnex and its corresponding chemical structure is also shown in Figure 1. All photopolymerization processes reported in this work were performed in mild conditions e.g. solvent-free and mild light irradiation conditions at room-temperature to develop green synthetic approaches towards polymers.</p>
        <p>The novel three-component photoinitiating systems were prepared by mixing the dyes, the iodonium salt (Iod) and the amine (EDB) as weight content ratios: 0.1%/2%/2% w/w/w in a benchmark monomer (tetrafunctional polyether acrylate noted TA), respectively. 2 Drops of prepared photosensitive formulations were deposited in laminate between 2 polypropylene films, then exposed to irradiation upon LED emitting at 405 nm (I0 = 110 mW.cm -2 ) at room temperature and under air for the Free Radical Polymerization (FRP); the thickness was controlled ~ 100 m. The vibration peak of the acrylate functionality was continuously monitored at ~6130 cm -1 by realtime FTIR spectroscopy (JASCO FTIR 4100) to follow the polymerization kinetics.</p>
        <p>The polymerization profiles were established using the following relationship of conversion and irradiation time: [36][37][38][39] conversion (%) = (A0 -At)/A0 × 100 (eq 1)</p>
        <p>where A0 is the initial peak area before irradiation and At is the peak area after irradiation for a given time t.</p>
        <p>Chemical mechanisms involved in the three-component PISs were investigated by combining several techniques, namely UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (JASCO V730 UV-visible spectrometer) used to record the UV-visible absorption spectra in photolysis experiments and a JASCO FP-6200 spectrofluorimeter for the fluorescence properties. The Stern-Volmer coefficients (Ksv) were calculated by the slopes of Stern-Volmer treatment for fluorescence quenching and the electron transfer quantum yields (et) were determined using the eq. 2: 37,38  et = Ksv[additive]/(1+Ksv[additive]) (eq 2)</p>
        <p>The redox potentials of all dyes (oxidation potential noted Eox and reduction potential noted Ered) were determined as follow. The dyes were dissolved in acetonitrile while using tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte (potential vs. Saturated Calomel Electrode, SCE). The singlet excited state energy level (Es1) was calculated from the crossing point of the UV-visible and fluorescence spectra.</p>
        <p>Thus, the free energy change from the singlet state (G S1 Iod or G S1 EDB) for the electron transfer reaction was determined with Eox, Ered, and Es1 which were calculated from equations 3 and 4. 40 Similarly, the free energy change from the triplet state (Get) was calculated with Eox, Ered, and ET1 from equations 5 and 6 40 whereas the triplet state energy level (ET1) was extracted from molecular energy

            <rs type="version">calculations</rs> (Gaussian 03 suite of programs). The reduction potential used for the iodonium salt was of -0.7 V 41 and the oxidation potential of EDB was of 1.0 V according to the literature data. 42 G S1 Iod = Eox -(-0.7) -ES1 (eq 3)

        <p>G T1 EDB = 1 -(Ered) -ET1 (eq 6)</p>
        <p>Photocomposites were prepared with three-component systems (dye/Iod/EDB, 0.1w%/2%/2%, w/w/w/) and a weight content of 20% was used for the silica fillers dispersed in the monomer (TA).</p>
        <p>Photosensitive formulations (TA as monomer) including PISs or PISs/silica was dropped onto a 2 mm-thick homemade tank and polymerized upon irradiation with a computer-controlled laser diode @405 nm with spot size around 50 μm. By direct laser write (DLW), tridimensional patterns of precise shapes could be prepared. Following their fabrications, the different 3D patterns were characterized by a numerical optical microscope (DSX-HRSU, OLYMPUS corporation). 43,44</p>

        <p>The extended aldehyde Cbz-BP has synthesized in three steps starting from 9ethyl-9H-carbazole. Especially, Cbz-BP was prepared by following a procedure previously used to convert Michler's ketone to Michler's aldehyde. 47 Notably, by performing a Friedel-Craft reaction on 9-ethyl-9H-carbazole with benzoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride, (9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)(phenyl)methanone could be prepared in 84% yield. Reduction with methylmagnesium iodide furnished 9ethyl-3-(1-phenylvinyl)-9H-carbazole in almost quantitative yield (See Scheme 1).</p>
        <p>Formylation of the alkene by a Vilsmeier Haack reaction gave Cbz-BP as a mixture of s-cis/s-trans isomers that could not be separated by column chromatography. If no structural determination was carried out to identify which isomer was the main product, a 2:1 ratio could be found on the proton NMR spectrum of Cbz-BP. This mixture of isomers was subsequently used for the synthesis of the different dyes.</p>
        <p>The different dyes of the series were prepared by a Knoevenagel reaction done in basic conditions. Except for dye 7 for which diisopropylamine (DIPEA) was used instead of piperidine, all dyes could be obtained with reaction yields ranging from 82 to 92% (see Scheme 2). In the case of dye 6, choice of DIPEA as the base was motivated by recent results reported in the literature mentioning a nucleophilic attack of secondary amines on the cyano groups of EA6, inducing a cyclization reaction and producing azafluorenone derivatives. 12,[48][49][50][51] Finally, dye 7 had to be prepared by using a specific procedure. Indeed, due to the remarkable stability of the EA7 anion in basic conditions, no condensation reaction can occur with an aldehyde. To circumvent this problem, the condensation of Cbz-BP and EA7 in acetic anhydride furnished dye 7 in 85% yield.</p>
        <p>Scheme 1. Synthetic route to Cbz-BP.</p>
        <p>Scheme 2. Synthetic route to dyes 1-12.</p>
        <p>In the case of symmetric electron acceptors (EA1, EA2, EA4, EA5, EA7, EA8 and EA9), the corresponding dyes (1, 2, 4, 5 and 7-9) were obtained as a mixture of s-cis and s-trans isomers. Conversely, a more complex situation was found for dyes prepared with EA3, EA6, EA10, EA11 and EA12, since in complement of a s-cis/s-trans mixture, the different electron acceptors could adopt two different orientations so that a mixture of 4 isomers could be theoretically obtained in these cases (See Figure 2). Besides, the steric hindrance induced by the use of asymmetric electron acceptors such as EA6 and EA10 certainly favour an orientation over the others. It has to be noticed that among the twelve electron acceptors used in this study, EA3 52 , EA6 53 , EA7 54 , EA8 55 , EA9 56 and EA10 48 had to be prepared.</p>
        <p>As depicted in Figure 3a, photopolymerization kinetics of TA upon irradiation with a LED at 405 nm using three-component photoinitiating systems (PISs) composed of the different dyes (from dye 1 to 12, 0.1% in monomer, w/w), the iodonium salt (used as electron acceptor, 2% in monomer, w/w) and the amine (used as electron donor, 2% in monomer, w/w) were monitored by Real-Time Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (RT-FTIR) at room temperature. As observed for dyes 1-12, the final acrylate function conversions (FCs) determined at 400 s are gathered in the Table 1 as well as the monomer conversions obtained with the reference two-component PIS (2% Iod: 2% amine in TA) without dyes (cited as dye 0/blank in Table 1). In fact, based on their photoinitiating abilities, the series of twelve dyes can be divided into two different families:</p>
        <p>(1) those exhibiting a good photoinitiating ability such as dyes 3, 6, 7, 8 with high final conversions (FCs) reaching 98% or above. Polymerizations carried out with these dyes were also characterized by short induction period (T-T0 with T: Start time of polymerization; T0: Start time of light irradiation). Typically, polymerization processes are ended within 50s, evidencing their remarkable photoinitiation abilities. In this latter series, the dye 7 is found the best one (combining high polymerization rate, low inhibition time and high FC).</p>
        <p>(</p>
        <p>Following the examination of the photoinitiating abilities of the different dyes, the polymerization of TA acrylate in DLW experiments was examined and initiated with a selected set of three-component systems (dye 3 (or 6, 7, 8)/Iod/amine). These systems were selected due to their excellent behaviors in FRP. The formation of tridimensional patterns ("SY" for dye 3, "SK" for dye 6, "RZ" for dye 7, "ZH" for dye 8) was successfully observed in a very short time and specificities of these 3D profiles, e.g.</p>
        <p>smooth surfaces, excellent spatial resolution, were demonstrated by profilometric observations via numerical optical microscopy (see Figure 5).</p>
        <p>Molar extinction coefficients of dyes were determined by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy in acetonitrile (see Figure S1) and the light absorption parameters are gathered in Table 2. As shown in Figure S1, the high maximum molar extinction coefficients at the maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) are ranging between 6440 M -1 .cm -1 for dye 9 and 53200 M -1 .cm -1 for dye 12, from 454 nm for dye 11 to 579 nm for dye 10, respectively (see Table 2). For more details, dyes 3, 5, 11, 12 showed very high maximum molar extinction coefficients which were higher than 40 000 M -1 .cm -1</p>
        <p>at their maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) e.g. ε(Dye 3) = 42 460 M -1 .cm -1 at λmax = 531 nm, ε(Dye 5) = 43 480 M -1 .cm -1 at λmax= 479 nm. ε(Dye 11) = 41 120 M - 1 .cm -1 at λmax = 454 nm, ε(Dye 12) = 53 200 M -1 .cm -1 at λmax = 456 nm, in the UVvisible absorption range. Interestingly, compared to dyes 1, 2, 11, 12, dyes 3, 6, 7</p>
        <p>showed relatively poor extinction coefficients at 405 nm: 11 150 M -1 .cm -1 for dye 3, 8430 M -1 .cm -1 for dye 6 and 7000 M -1 .cm -1 for dye 7 which not fit to their photoinitiation abilities and which was discussed in the section of 3.2. Parallel to this, dyes 4, 9, 10 which showed lower molar extinction coefficients (less than 30 000 M - 1 .cm -1 ) at their absorption maxima also proved to be poorer photoinitiators, even if higher molar extinction coefficients were detected at 405 nm for dyes 4 and 10 (reaching 10 000 M -1 .cm -1 ) compared to that of dyes 6, 7. In the case of dye 8, both good photoinitiation abilities and high molar extinction coefficients (ε max = 33500 M - 1 .cm -1 at λmax = 447 nm,  @405nm = 19500 M -1 .cm -1 ) were found for this dye, and the results confirmed the high performances of dye 8 as a reactive photoinitiator in free radical polymerization under exposure to both 405 nm LED and sunlight. dye/EDB. Remarkably, examination of these two reactions in solution was highly representative of the interactions existing in three-component systems. Conversely, dye 6 showed distinct photolysis processes compared to dye 3. Even if the decreasing tendencies were observed during the photolysis of the three systems: dye 6/Iod/EDB, dye 6/Iod and dye 6/EDB, however, photolysis of the dye 6/Iod system seemed to be less efficient than that of dye 6/EDB system: the consumption of dye 6 in dye/Iod only achieved ~10% while the consumption in dye/EDB reached ~13%. A similar process was found in the case of the dye 6/Iod/EDB three-component system (see Figure 7d), when compared to the dye 6/EDB interaction, indicating that the dye 6/EDB interaction drastically affects the efficiency of the integrated reaction in free radical polymerization process (See Figure 7).</p>
        <p>Upon irradiation at 405 nm with a LED, just like for dye 3 and dye 6, photolysis processes were also examined in the case of dye 7-based PISs, comprising the dye 7/Iod/EDB three-component system and the dye 7/Iod or dye 7/EDB two-component systems (see Figure S2a,b,c) upon exposure to the LED. The changes of consumption of dyes in PISs are shown in Figure S2d. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that dye 7/Iod and dye 7/EDB two-component PISs achieved similar dye-consumption percentages, more precisely, final dye-consumption of dye 7/Iod (~10.5%) was slightly higher than that of the dye 7/EDB system (~9.5%) during the photolysis process, which is different from the behaviors detected during the photolysis experiments of dyes 3 and 6. The consumption of dye 7 can be maximized in PISs composed of the three components (reached ~20%), proving that the interactions between dye 7/Iod/EDB are much efficient than that in the dye 7/Iod or dye 7/EDB two-component systems.</p>
        <p>Photolysis experiments were also performed with dye 8-based PISs, still under irradiation with a 405 nm LED. As observed for the previous systems, the three systems (dye 8/Iod/EDB, dye 8/Iod and dye 8/EDB) demonstrated obvious decreasing tendencies as shown in Figure S3. After irradiation, both the final consumptions of dye in two-component systems (dye/Iod and dye/EDB) reached the same value of 11% consumption and 26% consumption for the dye/Iod/EDB system (see Figure S4), indicating that the interactions in three-component systems are comparable to that observed for the dye 7-base PISs.</p>
        <p>Parallel to the LED-activated photolysis done with the three-component dye 8/Iod/EDB system, substitution of the 405 nm LED by sunlight to perform the different photolysis experiments was also investigated. As shown in Figure S3b, sunlight significantly activates the photolysis process. Surprisingly, the consumption of dye 8 is significantly accelerated in the presence of sunlight, and a higher dye consumption was obtained with sunlight than with a 405 nm LED, indicating the possible participation of UV sunlight (see Figure S4).</p>
        <p>In addition to the aforementioned conclusions, we also determined the theoretical parameters in the electron transfer reaction e.g. the singlet excited state energy (ES1), the free energy changes (G), the triplet state energies (calculated at the density functional theory level), Stern-Volmer coefficients and the electron transfer quantum yields for the investigated dyes, which contributed to get a deeper insight into the chemical mechanisms of FRPs. The different paramaters are listed in the Table 3. For Iod, the reduction potential of -0.7 V is used according to ref. [41]. b: calculated triplet state energy level at DFT level.</p>
        <p>The singlet excited state energies (ES1) of dyes were extracted by using the normalized UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectra in acetonitrile (see Figure S5), and by using the crossing point of the two curves (See Table 3, 1.97 eV for dye 3;</p>
        <p>2.00 eV for dye 6; 2.01 eV for dye 7). Conversely, no fluorescence spectrum could be recorded for dye 8 due to the presence of nitro group in this dye.</p>
        <p>The oxidation potential (Eox), the reduction potential (Ered) of for the electron transfer reaction of dyes 3, 6, 7, 8 have been extracted from their cyclic voltammograms (see Figure S6). The half peak oxidation potentials of dyes 3, 6, 7 (Eox) were calculated and gathered in Table 3 (0.29 V for dye 3, 0.18 V for dye 6, 0.78 V for dye 7). However, there is no current observed in oxidation cycle of dye 8 (see Figure S6d), indicating that its oxidation potential could be greater than 2.00V. In contrast, the reduction potential of four dyes are located at -0.62 V, -0.60 V, -0.65 V, -1.03 V (for dye 3, 6, 7, 8, respectively) and showed in Table 3.</p>
        <p>The free energy changes G S1 Iod or G S1 EDB for the electron transfer reaction between dyes and Iodonium salts or EDB were confirmed by equations (eq 3-6) and listed in Table 3 (GIod= -0.98eV, GEDB= -0.35eV for dye 3; GIod= -1.12eV, GEDB= -0.4eV for dye 6; GIod= -0.53eV, GEDB= -0.36eV for dye 7). G are &lt; 0, which indicate the theoretical feasibility of these electron transfer reactions.</p>
        <p>Calculations of the triplet energy levels ET1 (eV) of dyes 3, 6, 7, 8 were performed at DFT level, and gathered in Table 3. The triplet routes involved in mechanisms can be ruled out for the dye/EDB interactions due to all of their free energy changes at triplet state Get T1 are greater than 0, even if the dye/Iod interactions are less than 0 except dye 7/Iod combination.</p>
        <p>The photoinitiating ability of dyes was also studied by examining the fluorescence quenching experiments on dye 3, dye 6 and dye 7 in acetonitrile as well as their Stern-Volmer coefficients (Ksv) and the electron transfer quantum yields (et)</p>
        <p>were also carried out (see Table 3). Linear fluorescence quenching processes were observed (see Figure 8a, c for dye 3, Figure S7a, c for dye 7) for all dye/Iod or dye/EDB combinations except dye 8, fitting to the results of free energy changes discussed above.</p>
        <p>Their Stern-Volmer coefficients Ksv were determined by the slopes of Stern-Volmer treatment for fluorescence quenching (see Figure 8b, d for dye 3; Figure S7b, d for dye 7; Table 3) and high electron transfer quantum yields et were calculated by equation (eq 2) (Table 3). These data are in full agreement with the mechanisms discussed in photolysis part 3.4.2, and 3.4.3. To broaden the applications of the push-pull dyes, a possible application was proposed and examined by producing photocomposites by FRP. Photocomposites were prepared by adding silica fillers into the monomer (TA) at a weight ratio of 20%. PISs used in this part are the same as used before, namely, the dyes 3, 7 and 8/Iod/EDB threecomponent systems (0.1%/2%/2% in monomer, w/w/w). Here, the laser acts as the irradiation source to print the 3D patterns of photocomposites: "SEP", "SRZ", "021" (for dye 3, 7 and 8, respectively) with a high spatial resolution. The different 3D patterns with high spatial resolution were characterized by profilometric observations as shown in Figure 11.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, 12 new push-pull dyes (never synthesized before) with a N-ethyl carbazole-1-allylidene group were synthesized and examined for their photoinitiation</p>
        <p>dye/Iod/EDB and two-component systems dye/Iod or dye/EDB during photolysis. Furthermore, the weight concentration ratio of dyes/Iod/EDB in acetonitrile are fixed in all</p>
