        <p>Polyoxometalates (POMs) represent a class of nanomaterials, which hold enormous promise for a range of energy-related applications. Their promise is owing to their "special" structure that gives POMs a truly unique ability to control redox reactions in energy conversion and storage. One such amazing capability is their large number of redox active sites that arises from the complex threedimensional cluster of metal-oxide ions linked together by oxygen atoms. Here, a critical review on how POMs emerged from being molecular clusters for fundamental studies, to next-generation materials for energy applications is provided. We highlight how exploiting the versatility and activity of these molecules can lead to improved performance in energy devices such as supercapacitors and batteries, and in energy catalyst applications. The potential of POMs across numerous fields is systematically outlined by investigating structure-property-performance relationships and the determinant factors for energy systems. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for this class of materials with respect to addressing our pressing energy-related concerns are identified.Polyoxometalates (POMs) represent a class of nanomaterials, which hold enormous promise for a range of energy-related applications.

        <p>Unprecedented global energy demand and climate change have spawned broad based efforts to develop new sustainable clean energy conversion and storage technologies. A range of electrochemical energy systems have the potential to address critical energy demands, however, their performance is far from the expectations. To this end, particular emphasis has been given to the design and engineering of new functional materials. Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of metal oxide cluster anions with the ability to reversibly transfer multi-electrons have recently broken through as functional materials. POMs exhibit unique chemical properties unlike those of general metal complexes with various ligands. The open frameworks with independent structural units and richredox chemistry makes them ideal materials for cutting-edge energy-related technologies. Here, we provide critical analysis of the current knowledge on the impact of structure and properties of POMs for improved performance in energy devices. We believe that this review will not only provide the fundamental knowledge in the field of POMs-for-Energy but will also help to address the current challenges in electrification to decarbonize industry and society.Unprecedented global energy demand and climate change have spawned broad based efforts to develop new sustainable clean energy conversion and storage technologies.

        <p>Many countries around the world have set targets to limit anthropogenic climate change and with this comes an effort to reduce emissions that are the product of fossil fuel combustion. 1 This is driving a shift towards electrified transport systems, with urgent demand for improved energy storage; but these systems are only as clean as the source of the electricity they consume. Therefore, the transition towards energy production via renewable sources as well as efficient storage, are two inseparable parts of the net equation. Another trend seen in recent years is the rapid increase in portable electronics and electric devices for uses including communications, computing, sensing, entertainment, construction, and general maintenance. [1][2][3][4] A link between this trend climate change mitigation, is a very high demand for research and development of innovative electrical energy conversion and storage.Many countries around the world have set targets to limit anthropogenic climate change and with this comes an effort to reduce emissions that are the product of fossil fuel combustion. 1 This is driving a shift towards electrified transport systems, with urgent demand for improved energy storage; but these systems are only as clean as the source of the electricity they consume.

        <p>Polyoxometalates (POMs) are an exceptional group of inorganic redox active materials that consist of multiple metal-oxide ions linked together by oxygen atoms to form nanoclusters within an ordered three-dimensional framework. Their size allows them to be viewed as a type of oxide quantum dots, 11,12 possessing a very high surface to bulk ratio. Their rapid and highly reversible redox activity endows them with excellent electrochemical properties. This underpins the motivation for an increasing amount of research into POMs for energy materials and other related applications.Polyoxometalates (POMs) are an exceptional group of inorganic redox active materials that consist of multiple metal-oxide ions linked together by oxygen atoms to form nanoclusters within an ordered three-dimensional framework.

        <p>POMs have a history dating back to the late 1700s when heteropoly acids were first discovered. From the early 1800s their complex structure was the subject of theorizing. 13 It was not until 1934 when J. F. Keggin used x-ray diffraction to interpret the structure of 12-phosphotungstic acid, 13 that some level of agreement about structure started to be reached. The general chemical form of the class of POMs to which 12-phosphotungstic acid belongs can be written XM 12 O 40 , where X denotes a heteroatom and M a transition metal addenda atom. This form is named after its discoverer and is referred to as the Keggin structure. It remains one of the most widely investigated and understood structural forms of POMs.POMs have a history dating back to the late 1700s when heteropoly acids were first discovered.

        <p>Part of the attraction to these metal oxide clusters relates to their broad range of possible redox states and valences, while the molecular cluster itself may experience very little change in its physical structure. For example, stable crystal forms of ionic POM compounds can be synthesized that possess the same stoichiometry in the POM anion, but the anion may carry a different charge. The salt 14 A solid crystalline product of the salt possessed a deep blue color. The authors describe how the extra two "blue electrons" hop between the (tungsten) metal atoms at the center of each tetrahedra that make up the cluster (see Figure 1 for a visualization of the tetrahedra forming a POM cluster). However, they also emphasize that molecular orbitals involving oxygen atoms play an important role in electron delocalization. Yet, despite the changes in valency, the bond lengths between the addenda atoms and other metal-oxygen bonds in the POM cluster change only on the order of a few percent of an Angstrom, and the cluster maintains a specific α type of Keggin structure (see Figure 1), that actually becomes more rigid. These features hint at the capability of POMs to act as stable and versatile molecular reservoirs for charge carriers.Part of the attraction to these metal oxide clusters relates to their broad range of possible redox states and valences, while the molecular cluster itself may experience very little change in its physical structure.

The challenges of anchoring POMs to other hybridizing materials are presented with other interesting properties and theoretical insights to be used in energy-devices.

This allows the article to present the major breakthroughs in stable attachment of POMs to conductive or chemically active electrode components, the use of POMs as precursors to other high surface area active materials, and POM hybrid materials for batteries. The following section goes into discussion of the science and engineering of POMs for catalysis applications (section 4). Research on POM-based catalysts has greatly increased in the last few years. Among the research fields, chemical oxygen reactions, such as for oxygen evolution (in electrolyzers) and for oxygen reduction (in fuel cells) represent a bottleneck for the development of energy conversion technologies. The section also includes a discussion on the progress of POM-based materials in different catalytic reactions such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction, nitrogen (N 2 ) reduction and biomass conversion. Each section presents perspectives on the different roles for POMs in energy, including those which are expected to stimulate new research directions.

        <p>The key opportunity that POMs offer to enhance energy storage devices lies with their ultradispersed nature (all or most active centers are surface atoms) and with their ability to reversibly exchange large numbers of electrons. Up to +/-24 e per molecule has been claimed in some cases. 37 However, such a degree of reduction is debated and is in conflict with other knowledge on POMs, which sets a more conservative limit for the number of electrons that can be exchanged reversibly. 38 As a pure material, POMs are generally electrically insulating. Therefore, exploiting the desirable qualities of POM complexes requires them to be supported on conductive pathways. In the context of SC electrodes, it is of particular importance to maintain a high surface area for double layer capacitance and high power handling, as well as chemical stability for long cycle life. 39 The aim of combining high surface area, electrical conductivity and chemical stability has stimulated the creation of a wide range of hybrid materials. The definition of a hybrid material herein means a POM-based material that through a given synthesis procedure has been combined at a molecular level with some other material/s to achieve synergistic properties.

        <p>The motivation for this type of best-of-both-worlds chemical hybridization is enhancing EDL performance with the redox contribution of POMs. This contribution can be quite significant. For example, the use of a polymerized imidazolium linker (PIL) cation to secure GeMo 12 and SiMo 12 POMs to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been shown to achieve an increase of more than nine times the capacitive performance relative to bare MWCNTs -191 F.cm -3 . 40 In this study, a layer-by-layer (LbL) method of constructing the conducting polymer-carbon-POM composite was used and was compared to using a more conventional linker, poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA). The performance of the PIL is significant, because PDDA as a linking polymer has itself been shown to offer reasonable performance at high charge-discharge current densities, which is synonymous with high CV scan rates. For example, PDDA-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (PDDA-rGO) was used as the conductive matrix to support PMo 12-x W x O 40 3-(PMoW), 41 and a capacitance of 140 F.g -1 at 10 A.g -1 was reported.The motivation for this type of best-of-both-worlds chemical hybridization is enhancing EDL performance with the redox contribution of POMs. This contribution can be quite significant.

        <p>The above results demonstrate that nano-sized POM particles can serve as excellent precursors to nitrides and oxides for energy storage because their high surface-to-bulk ratio enables facile and complete reactive pathways towards relevant products, and because the product materials are able to retain this property. Retaining the high surface-to-bulk means that metal oxides and nitrides produced via such routes can overcome some of the perceived limitations of conductivity and electrochemical stability, since these limitations are generally associated with the bulk properties of such materials. For example, smaller particles allow intimate contact with conductive scaffold materials. It is also proposed that smaller particles promote higher voltage windows. Therefore, producing high surface-to-bulk oxides and nitrides from POMs can effectively side-step the limitations of powdered versions of such compounds to enable end-products with desirable properties.The above results demonstrate that nano-sized POM particles can serve as excellent precursors to nitrides and oxides for energy storage because their high surface-to-bulk ratio enables facile and complete reactive pathways towards relevant products, and because the product materials are able to retain this property.

        <p>Wu et al. 70 Their product was a quasi-solid-state IL possessing a solid layered structure below 80 °C while transitioning to a liquid above this temperature. The electrical conductivity of the material was measured, and the authors found a significant increase in this property above the liquid transition temperature. They report values of about 10 × 10 -3 S.cm -1 at room temperature, and 8.60 × 10 -2 S.cm -1 at 83 °C. It was concluded that this result was due to the improved diffusion of the ions above the liquid transition temperature. 70 In a later study by Tong et al. 71 The above cases demonstrate the interesting characteristics of these novel types of electrolytes. However, the temperature ranges in which high ionic conductivity occurs make them more appropriate for application such as fuel cells etc. Charge storage devices like SCs generally require peak performance of the materials to fall in a window a few tens of degrees either side of ambient temperatures, making these gel-liquids unsuitable. Wu et al. 72 investigated two types of IL electrolytes consisting of POM polyanions combined with tetraalkylphosphonium (TBTP) cations.Wu et al. 70 Their product was a quasi-solid-state IL possessing a solid layered structure below 80 °C while transitioning to a liquid above this temperature.

        <p>They conclude that the Dawson-type POM (P 2 W 16 V 2 O 62 ) possesses better thermal and charge conductivity properties than the Keggin-type (PW 10 V 2 O 40 ) to which it was compared. These conclusions are based upon the calculated energies associated with the lattice potential and the ionic migration potential, where in both cases the Dawson-type structure shows a lower energy requirement. The [TBTP] 8 P 2 W 16 V 2 O 62 IL shows a phase transition from solid-gel to liquid at around 50 °C which is greatly reduced against that seen in previous studies as well as against the [TBTP] 5 PW 10 V 2 O 40 Keggin-based IL against which it is compared (61°C), and almost reaching the ranges required for application in typical energy storage devices. Even though the above results lay just outside the range of practical use for energy storage, it is worth noting that the authors show a strong link between the improved properties of the Dawson type structure and its larger POM anion size. This offers predictive insight for the rational design and selection of POM based electrolyte systems, which justifies further research into these ionic gel-liquid systems.They conclude that the Dawson-type POM (P 2 W 16 V 2 O 62 ) possesses better thermal and charge conductivity properties than the Keggin-type (PW 10 V 2 O 40 ) to which it was compared.

These five Keggin structures were investigated for their binding lengths and electron sharing under various orientations on a carbon substrate, and neutralizing counter-ions (cations) were included to balance the charge of the Keggin anions. For PdMo 12 and RuNb 12 the calculation was fully predictive, as these systems have not, to date, been synthesized. For the SiW 12 and RuNb 12 systems, the results indicate that functionalization of the carbon surface may not be required for sufficient anchoring and feasible use as hybrid (electrode) materials.The mechanisms of bonding between carbon and POMs are not fully understood, and so to explore this further Muniz et al. 73 adsorbed onto a carbon surface.

        <p>In 2019, Dubal et al. 65 simulated the adsorption of a number of combinations of the materials used in their study of molybdenum nitride nanocrystals. Again, the simulations were performed using DFT, in this case in the 
            <rs type="software">Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)</rs>. As described in detail in section 2.1, the experimental approach in this work used CF coated with PMo 12 as a substrate. The material was then converted to MoN@P-CF, where MoN nanocrystals were formed and the CF became phosphorous doped. Simulations reveal that the phosphorous doping of the CF enhances the energy of adsorption for protons (simulated as hydronium) over the bare carbon surface. However, the MoN@P-CF material has an adsorption energy over eight times greater than that of the phosphorous-doped CF. This theoretical element of the work strongly supports the experimental findings. Likewise, Yang and co-workers 45 5e). These DFT results suggest that the H adsorption energetics on a POM in the POM/PIL nanohybrids is significantly affected by adjacent PILs and POMs. From an electrostatic standpoint, the PIL cations and the POM anions suppress and facilitate the proton adsorption reaction, respectively, on the adjacent POM.

        <p>Gullen et al. 74 performed in-silico simulations of the CNT functionalization that was experimentally explored by Gallegos et al. 31 Specifically, they used DFT to investigate the bond formation between Keggin-type SiW 12 and organic functional groups attached to a CNT. The functional groups are denoted φ-X, where φ denotes a phenyl group and X is one of -NH 2 , -OH, -COH, or -COOH. The bond lengths are similar for the different functional pairs, however SiW 12 @φ -COOH/CNT shows enhanced attraction over the others. Whereas the first three systems explored (-NH 2 , -OH, -COH ) exhibit van der Waals type interactions, the -COOH system exhibits a covalentlike binding energy, making its combinations with SiW 12 a strong potential candidate for a stable hybrid system (Figure 5 f,g). 74 The significance of the previous study is emphasized in closing this chapter -it is well known that stabilizing POMs on a graphene surface remains challenging. 75 Therefore, predicting functional groups that are more likely to result in the successful anchoring of materials like POMs, but also other classes as well, is of great importance to rationally guide research efforts. The covalent type anchoring of POMs via carboxylate groups represents a great example of how simulation can guide novel syntheses. Therefore, combining the efforts of both theoretical work and applied materials research is an effective approach to improving devices.Gullen et al. 74 performed in-silico simulations of the CNT functionalization that was experimentally explored by Gallegos et al. 31 Specifically, they used DFT to investigate the bond formation between Keggin-type SiW 12 and organic functional groups attached to a CNT.

        <p>The development of high-performance rechargeable batteries, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs), is one of the most important challenges in energy storage, and arguably stands to contribute as much as any other field toward solving increasing environmental and energy issues. The charge storage in rechargeable batteries results from reversible redox reactions in the electrode active materials. 76 The stored energy in batteries can be improved by either increasing the capacity of the electrode materials or exploring new cathode materials with higher voltages. 77 The following sections explore how POMs have been able to contribute to this development.The development of high-performance rechargeable batteries, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs), is one of the most important challenges in energy storage, and arguably stands to contribute as much as any other field toward solving increasing environmental and energy issues.

        <p>LIBs are the preferred energy storage system for many applications due to their high voltage of more than 3.5 V per cell, high energy density of up to 200 Wh.kg -1 and relatively long cycle life.LIBs are the preferred energy storage system for many applications due to their high voltage of more than 3.5 V per cell, high energy density of up to 200 Wh.kg -1 and relatively long cycle life.</p>
        <p>The most common cathode materials used in LIBs are lithium transition metal oxides including layered structures such as LiCoO 2 , spinel structures such as LiMn 2 O 4 , or olivine structures such as LiFePO 4 . However, the changes in crystal structure of these materials during the intercalation (and de-intercalation) of lithium ions result in capacity loss during cycling. Therefore, their specific capacity is usually less than 200 mAh.g -1 . 76,[78][79][80] For anodes, graphite is the most commonly used material in commercial LIBs. However, the theoretical capacity of graphite is low (372 mAh.g -1 ), which limits its applications in large-scale systems. 77,80 Therefore, great efforts have been dedicated to developing new materials for LIBs. Recently, POMs have received much interest as electrode materials in LIBs (Table 1). The characteristic capacity and cycling stability of POMs are independent of the material's crystalline stability because the POM molecular clusters show multi-electron redox as an individual molecule. Although POMs have low electrical conductivity, using nanosized POMs and/or mixing with conductive additives can improve their electrochemical properties. [81][82][83][84][85][86] Their application to LIB research can be categorized by the POM type being used, such as by the addenda atom type, or by specific groupings of hybridized materials, such as the nanocarbon or MOF hybrids described in the following sections.The most common cathode materials used in LIBs are lithium transition metal oxides including layered structures such as LiCoO 2 , spinel structures such as LiMn 2 O 4 , or olivine structures such as LiFePO 4 .

        <p>Phosphomolybdic acid is perhaps the most widely explored precursor to develop the electrode materials for energy storage applications. This work was pioneered in the late 90s by the group of Gomez-Romero who showed the potential of POMs in LIBs. 25 The group was able to demonstrate anchoring of POMs to the conducting polymer polyaniline, which allowed insertion and de-insertion of Li cations without simultaneously removing the POM anion. 87 This work was followed by the demonstration of the hybrid material as an electrode in LIBs. 88 Much more recently, Sonoyama and coworkers 82,89 examined the electrochemical properties of a potassium-based variant of the Keggin-type polyoxomolybdate, K 3 [PMo 12 O 40 ] (KPM), applying it as a cathode material for LIBs. The KPM showed a high initial discharge capacity over 200 mAh.g -1 in the potential range of 1.5 V -4.2 V. Although a high capacity was achieved, KPM showed poor cycle stability, as only 37.5% of its initial capacity was maintained after 50 cycles, which resulted from the structural instability of the reduced [PMO 12 O 40 ] 3-cluster ion in the organic solvent.Phosphomolybdic acid is perhaps the most widely explored precursor to develop the electrode materials for energy storage applications.

        <p>Furthermore, the calculated energy density of KPM was only 480 mW.h.g -1 , which is not far from that of conventional cathode materials (LiCoO 2 ~500 mWh.g -1 , LiMn 2 O 4 ~400 mW.h.g -1 ). This is a consequence of the lower discharge voltage of KPM (2.5 -1. as LIB-cathode. 91 In order to improve the low conductivity of the POMs, NAM was mixed with two types of conductive additives, namely ketjen black (KB) and acetylene black (AB) using two different methods such as hand grinding and ball milling. Both methods and conductive additives affect the capacity and cycling stability of NAM. The maximum discharge capacity of 437 mAh.g -1 was achieved, which was maintained to 399 mAh.g -1 after 50 cycles for ball-milled NAM/KB sample.Furthermore, the calculated energy density of KPM was only 480 mW.h.g -1 , which is not far from that of conventional cathode materials (LiCoO 2 ~500 mWh.g -1 , LiMn 2 O 4 ~400 mW.h.g -1 ).

        <p>The above results can, at least in part be explained by: (1) the improved electric conductivity, resulting from the high electrical conductivity of the KB and producing larger contact surface area between KB and NAM through ball milling, (2) the stable structure of [AlMo 6 O 24 H 6 ] 3-during redox reaction (Figure 6c). However, the amount of NAM in the cathode was low (32 wt %), which can restrict the energy density of the cell. To further increase the discharge capacity and cycling stability, the nanosized POMs were used along with conductive additives. 84 The POM (NH 4 ) 6 [NiMo 9 O 32 ] (ANM) was investigated using either KB or AB. In this work, four different samples were tested as LIB cathode materials; ANM microparticles hand-ground with AB (m/AB), ANM NPs hand-ground with AB (n/AB), ANM NPs hand-ground with KB (n/KB), and ANM in situ crystallized in KB (nanocomposite ANM/KB). Better discharge capacities and cycling performance were obtained with the n/KB and nanocomposite ANM/KB. The n/KB cathode exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 490 mAh.g -1 and a very stable cycling performance, with capacity retention of 87.6% after 50 cycles. Although the nanocomposite ANM/KB cathode showed high initial capacity at low current density, it showed a poor cycling stability as compared to n/KB (61.6% after 50 cycles). This might be due to the increase in the catalytic activity of the nanocomposite ANM/KB, which leads to the formation of surface film and eventually increases its interfacial impedance. However, at high current densities (from 83 to 500 mA.g -1 ), the nanocomposite ANM/KB showed relatively higher discharge capacity and rate-capability than that of n/KB. Ex situ XRD analysis indicated that the crystal structure of ANM remains amorphous during insertion and extraction of Li ions (charge/discharge processes), which enables high reversible capacity with deep discharge-charge cycles.The above results can, at least in part be explained by: (1) the improved electric conductivity, resulting from the high electrical conductivity of the KB and producing larger contact surface area between KB and NAM through ball milling, (2) the stable structure of [AlMo 6 O 24 H 6 ] 3-during redox reaction (Figure 6c).

        <p>Vanadium-based POMs have proven to be practical cathode materials due to their low molecular weights leading to high specific capacities and fast charging/discharging kinetics, which resulted from their stable ionic cluster. 92 The electrochemical properties of V-based POMs; bi-capped Keggin-type (KH) 9 [PV 14 O 42 ] (KPV), 89 K 7 [NiV 13 O 38 ] (KNiV), 81 and K 7 [MnV 13 O 38 ] (KMV) 83 , have been recently reported as LIB-cathode materials. These V-POMs displayed comparable discharge capacities to those of Mo-based POMs, but with much higher cycling performance. This indicates that the electrochemical stability of V-POM is not dependent on the stability of crystal structure, but rather on the stability of their cluster ions; [PV 14 O 42 ] 9-, [NiV 13 O 38 ] 7-and [MnV 13 O 38 ] 7-. KPV exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 370 mAh.g -1 with cycle stability of 95% over 50 cycles, which is very high compared to that reported from KPM (~37.5%). KNiV NPs were prepared by a recrystallization method to improve the capacity and cycle performance of V-based materials. Recrystalized KNiV delivered discharge capacities of 218.2 and 121.3 mAh.g -1 at current densities of 17 and 167 mA.g -1 , respectively. It also showed good cycling stability with a reversible capacity of about 200 mAh.g -1 after 24 cycles at 17 mA.g -1 . The observed high capacity and rate capability most likely result from the use of nanosized KNiV, which offers improved specific surface area and reduced diffusion lengths. Concerning KMV, micro-sized KMV (m-KMV) showed a discharge capacity of 187 mAh.g -1 at 17 mA.g -1 . When the particle size was decreased to nanoscale, discharge capacities were increased to 308 mAh.g -1 , for the same respective current density. However, at voltages higher than 3.8 V, nanosized KMV (n-KMV) showed overcharge capacities of 37 and 15 mAh.g -1 , respectively. This may result in electrolyte decomposition, which in turn leads to the formation of a thick passivating layer on the cathode. The passivation layer decreases the ionic and electronic conduction at the cathode/electrolyte interface. This is why the authors proposed to use the mixture of nano and micro-sized KMV particles (n/m-KMV; 1:1 weight ratio) (n/m-KMV).Vanadium-based POMs have proven to be practical cathode materials due to their low molecular weights leading to high specific capacities and fast charging/discharging kinetics, which resulted from their stable ionic cluster. 92 The electrochemical properties of V-based POMs; bi-capped Keggin-type (KH) 9 [PV 14 O 42 ] (KPV), 89 K 7 [NiV 13 O 38 ] (KNiV), 81 and K 7 [MnV 13 O 38 ] (KMV) 83 , have been recently reported as LIB-cathode materials.

        <p>In other work, Li et al. 93 replaced the counter cations K + in K 7 [MnV 13 O 38 ] (KMV) (which has large equivalent mass) by NH 4 + with a smaller equivalent mass to fabricate (NH 4 ) 7 [MnV 13 O 38 ] (AMV). The modified AMV nanoparticles showed a reversible capacity of 234 mAh.g -1 at 0.5 C, which was retained at 234 mAh.g -1 after 100 cycles. Moreover, AMV displayed rate capability of 53% when the C-rate was increased from 1 to 5 C. An energy density of 553 mWh.g -1 was estimated over 100 cycles, which was two-fold higher than that of the layered Li-transition metal oxide cathodes. To prevent the electrolyte decomposition and increase the electron transport in POMs, authors 94 coated the surface of polyoxovanadate, K 9 [PV 14 O 32 ] (KPV) NPs with a conducting polymer, polypyrrole (PP) (5 nm thick). In this hybrid, a thin conducting layer provides high conductivity and avoids the irreversible reactions. The capacities of 410, 415 and 300 mAh.g -1 were recorded for PP-KPV at current densities of 167, 500 and 1000 mA.g -1 , respectively. Interestingly, PP-KPV showed a cycling stability of 90% (370 mAh.g -1 ) and 93% (280 mAh.g -1 ) over 50 cycles at 167 and 1000 mA.g -1 , respectively. This confirmed that coating PP on KPV NPs suppresses electrolyte decomposition, improves rate capability and cycling stability.In other work, Li et al. 93 replaced the counter cations K + in K 7 [MnV 13 O 38 ] (KMV) (which has large equivalent mass) by NH 4 + with a smaller equivalent mass to fabricate (NH 4 ) 7 [MnV 13 O 38 ] (AMV).

        <p>As discussed earlier, the direct utilization of pristine POMs as electrode materials in energy storage devices is limited by their poor electrical conductivity and high solubility in water and many organic solvents. Thus, it is useful to consider the use of highly conductive organic materials as substrates such as conducting polymers or carbon materials for the fabrication of POM energy storage electrodes. 97 The hybridization between POMs and nanocarbons, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, has been proven to increase the energy storage capability of LIBs due to the combination of the redox reaction of POMs and capacitive effect of the nanocarbons. 86,[98][99][100][101] Different approaches have been developed to connect the POMs onto nanocarbon materials including covalent functionalization, in which POMs are covalently grafted onto organic moieties, and non-covalent functionalization using intermolecular interactions such as electrostatic interactions and the π-π interaction between POMs and organic materials. 102 For instance, Kawasaki et al. 85 developed a nanohybrid POMs/SWNT system as a cathode material. They expected that the nanohybridization between the POM and SWNTs would increase the lithium ion diffusion and electron transfer through the SWNTs (Figure 8 (a)). In their study, a Keggin-type POM, TBA 3 [PMo 12 O 40 ] was deposited onto the surfaces of the SWNTs by electrostatic interactions. The nano-hybrid POM/SWNT delivered a capacity of 320 mAh.g -1 with a good cycle performance. The high capacity of the POM/SWNT system can be ascribed to the high surface area and conducting super-highway of CNTs.As discussed earlier, the direct utilization of pristine POMs as electrode materials in energy storage devices is limited by their poor electrical conductivity and high solubility in water and many organic solvents.

        <p>Several POM/CNT composites have been developed through covalent and noncovalent bonding to improve the affinity of POMs to CNTs. For example, Song et al., 98 developed noncovalent functionalization of SWNTs with a covalently functionalized pyrene-POM hybrid (Py-SiW 11 ) and served as LIB anode. The pyrene moieties were covalently linked to the SiW 11 clusters to form Py-SiW 11 hybrids, which were then attached to SWNTs through both π-π stacking and electrostatic interactions. The SWNTs/Py-SiW 11 nanocomposite exhibited a capacity of 1569.8 mAh.g -1 at 0.5 mA.cm -2 and capacity retention of 37 % after 100 cycles. This work was extended by covalently grafting SiW 11 -NH 2 onto CNTs by amide bonds to prepare CNTs/SiW 11 nanocomposites. 86 The covalent bonding introduces a stable link between the POMs and the CNTs and creates more sidewall defects in the CNTs, which results in more Li ion diffusion pathways. As an anode, CNTs/SiW 11 nanocomposite showed a capacity of 1189 mAh.g -1 and capacity retention of 54.6% (650 mAh.g -1 ) after 100 cycles. They also prepared a ternary PMO 12 /PANI/MWNTs nanocomposite through noncovalent functionalization to further improve the connection between POMs and CNTs. 99 This was achieved by using conductive polymers, which have strong π-π interaction with CNTs and strong electrostatic interaction with POMs. The electrochemical investigation of the PMO 12 /PANI/MWNTs nanocomposite as a LIB anode resulted in a capacity of 1572 mAh.g -1 , which was retained at 1000 mA.h.g -1 (63.6%) after 100 cycles at 0.5 mA.cm -2 .Several POM/CNT composites have been developed through covalent and noncovalent bonding to improve the affinity of POMs to CNTs.

        <p>The capacitive effect of POM/nanocarbon composites can be further improved by using graphene, which has higher available specific surface area than CNTs. Hence, several studies regarding POM/graphene nanocomposites have been reported for capacitive-type devices. 39,50,57 These types of composites are also appealing for battery applications, for example, Wang et al. 100 reported a Keggin-type SiW 12 /rGO nanocomposite as a cathode material for LIBs. A capacity of 275 mAh.g -1 was achieved at a current density of 50 mA.g -1 , which was ~1.7 times higher than that of the pure SiW 12 (160 mAh.g -1 ). Kume et al. 103 Further work to improve the capacity and cycling stability of POM/graphene nanocomposites was performed by Ni et al. 104 A 3D graphene/polyaniline/POM hybrid (rGO@PANI/PW 12 ) was developed as LIB-cathode, which showed a specific capacity of 285 mAh.g -1 at 50 mA.g -1 with good rate capability (140 mAh.g -1 at 2 A.g -1 ) and excellent cycling stability (only 0.028% loss per cycle capacity) over 1,000 cycles. The high capacity and good cycle stability of the reported (rGO@PANI/PW 12 ) cathode can be attributed to the fast electron transfer from reduced PANI polycation to PW 12 polyanion, as well as the high redox properties of the PW 12 . Nevertheless, deeper insight and understanding into the nature of the charge transfer between the POMs and the conducting supports is required in order to realize their practical application in LIBs.The capacitive effect of POM/nanocarbon composites can be further improved by using graphene, which has higher available specific surface area than CNTs.

The latter is possible because sodium does not alloy with aluminum, unlike lithium.

Unlike conventional secondary batteries they utilize liquid electrodes. 116,117 RFBs use two redox-active solutions with different redox potentials, known as an anolyte and catholyte. The two solutions are stored in separate containers and are continuously pumped through battery stack compartments where reversible redox reactions can occur at the interface of each inert electrode. 118 The anolyte and catholyte solutions are separated by an ionic conducting membrane or separator, which allows the transport of charge carrying ions. A schematic diagram of a RFB is shown in Figure 10. The unique design and the working mechanism of the RFB offers several promising features. As an example, their flexible modular design allows RFBs to be sized, as required, to cover a wide range of energy and power requirements of the consumer market. The energy and power characteristics of RFBs are not as explicitly coupled with each other when compared to other classes of batteries. This is due to the electrolyte and electrode being stored in separate containers. The de-coupling of these characteristics makes them unique for commercial application. 117 In case of RFBs, the energy capacity is related to the volume of the electrolyte reservoirs, while the power capability depends upon the size of the battery stack.

        <p>The Keggin types of POM are best suited for catalysis application as they are uniquely stable amongst other structural motifs. As a result, they have already been applied in various industrial processes as a catalyst. 129 They owe their extraordinary catalytic properties to the presence of numerous active sites per molecule. Their proton binding sites promote acid-catalyzed reactions and their electron-rich oxygen sites promote base-catalyzed reactions. However, the most important active sites in POM/heteropolyacid (HPA) compounds are at metal atoms, which take part in all oxidative reactions, some acid-catalyzed reactions, and other reactions. The precise active sites of POMs depend upon the type of reaction. As a catalyst used in oxidative reactions, POM/HPA (mostly W/Mo-based) compounds are well explored. In the case of substituted W/Mo, the active sites depend upon the type of metal ion substituted. Considering the variety of the metals that can be introduced into POMs, these active sites can be engineered to tailor their properties for specific applications.The Keggin types of POM are best suited for catalysis application as they are uniquely stable amongst other structural motifs.

        <p>In recent years, research on materials for clean and sustainable energy sources has grown substantially. Splitting water to produce hydrogen and oxygen is one convenient way for energy conversion. 130 Due to their stability and extensive tunability, POMs are attractive as water reduction catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and most expansively, water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). [131][132][133] Indeed, POMs have been successfully implemented in the fabrication of overall water splitting systems. 134 On the other hand, electrochemical oxygen redox reactions are considered to be the key for energy conversion and storage including fuel cells and metal-air batteries. 135 In general, fuel cells devices are based on the electrocatalytic oxidation of a fuel (e.g. hydrogen and methanol) at the anode and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode. Notably, OER (section 4.1) and ORR (section 4.2) are the two fundamental reactions in fuel cells and energy storage devices. In ORR, strong double bonds have to be broken for the formation of hydroxyl or peroxide ions from oxygen molecule and vice versa is true for OER, both reactions involving four electrons. Hence, they are often described as sluggish compared to their anodic counterparts, namely hydrogen evolution and oxidation which are two electron processes. 136 Therefore, it is necessary that the catalysts used for ORR and OER are highly active for achieving better performance parameters of the devices, which has stimulated the development of novel water oxidation and oxygen reduction catalysts over the past years.In recent years, research on materials for clean and sustainable energy sources has grown substantially.

        <p>Water oxidation involves the dissociation of protons and electrons from stable water molecules, as well as the formation of an O-O bond from formally separated water molecules. The overall OER process typically occurs via four elementary steps involving different reaction intermediates and the formation of an O-O bond (eventually released as O 2 ). This latter step has been proposed to occur through two primary pathways, the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) and the interaction of two metal-oxo entities (I2M). 138 As shown in Figure 11, both reaction paths begin with two proton electron transfer (PET) events, giving rise to a metal-oxo intermediate. The WNA mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of a solvent water molecule together with a PET resulting in a hydroper-oxo intermediate, which finally evolves molecular oxygen via another PET. On the other hand, the O-O bond formation in the I2M mechanism involves the coupling of two separate metal-oxo moieties, leading to a peroxo species that eventually produces O 2 and regenerates the catalyst. In addition to the intrinsic thermodynamic demands of water splitting, kinetic obstacles impose significant activation energies (overpotentials) and require the development of efficient catalysts. 129 WOCs composed of all-inorganic POMs have advanced the field of water splitting over the past decade. 131 Lacunary POMs, "defect" structures made by removing M=O entities, are good inorganic multidentate ligands to stabilize multi-metal oxide clusters. Thus, the robust structure of lacunary POM ligands have been exploited for the assembly of catalytically active transition metaloxo clusters. Herein, in the following section we discuss the progress on POM WOCs organized in terms of the transition metal providing the active sites in the catalyst. Comparison of the catalytic activity of different systems is only possible in the case of uniform experimental conditions for all water oxidation catalytic species. However, since not all systems can perform under the same combination of conditions, comparison of different catalysts should be done with caution. As discussed by Hill et al, 133,139 there have not been any established agreements on how to compare catalyst's activity of different systems in the literature. Nevertheless, in the following section catalysts will be often compared in terms of turnover numbers (TON: ratio of product formed per catalyst molecule) and turnover frequencies (TOF: d(TON)/dt) under analogous experimental conditions.Water oxidation involves the dissociation of protons and electrons from stable water molecules, as well as the formation of an O-O bond from formally separated water molecules.

        <p>Ru-based catalysts are interesting because of their ability to act as a powerful oxidant in nearneutral pH conditions. In 2008, Bonchio 140 and Hill 149 This energy wasting process is detrimental to photocatalytic activity, as it competes appreciably with the primary photoreaction of the excited PS with the SA, even in high ionic strength media. In this context, keeping the catalyst concentration as low as possible can prevent quenching of excited Ru(bpy) 3 2+ , however, at the cost of slowing the hole-transfer process. Another strategy to overcome this issue is the use of PSs that favor the productive, reductive quenching of the excited PS by Ru 4 Si 2 rather than the unproductive oxidative quenching. This implies the use of PSs being strong electron acceptors in the excited state, such as a tetranuclear dendrimeric Ru II polypyridine complex 150,151 or multi-perylene-bisimide chromophores. 152 In the common oxidative quenching pathway in the presence of an SA, oxidized PS is irreversibly produced so that, in principle, fast hole transfer is not a strict requirement. In practice, however, the PSs, in their oxidized form, are often unstable under the reaction conditions used and fast hole scavenging is pivotal to minimize their decomposition (usually the main limiting factor in terms of turnover performance). As electron transfer from catalyst to PS is primarily diffusion controlled, PS degradation can be mitigated on a photoelectrode, where a close contact exists between the two components and transfer of electrons from the catalyst occurs rapidly after oxidation of the PS. 148 Several triadic photoanodes composed of nanoporous MO 2 (M = Ti, Zr and Sn) films sensitized with different cationic Ru PSs have been reported.

Moreover, atomic layer deposition was successfully used to protect the attachment of POM WOCs on the surface of visible-light-absorbing hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ) photoanodes. 157 Instead of immobilization within a host material with a well-defined porous structure, it is also possible to immobilize catalysts by in situ hybridization with polymeric materials on the surface of photoelectrodes. Very recently, Ru 4 Si 2 was co-deposited on WO 3 photoanodes with various electropolymerized conducting polymers. 158 The photoelectrochemical performance for visible-lightdriven water oxidation of WO 3 photoanodes can be remarkably improved only when co-depositing polypyrrole (PPy) and Ru 4 Si 2 due to the desired energy level alignment for efficient charge transfer.Ru-based catalysts are interesting because of their ability to act as a powerful oxidant in nearneutral pH conditions.

It is also noteworthy that a Ba-Co 9 /lead composite has been investigated recently as anode for OER during zinc electrowinning. 201 The OER is the most common anode or counter reaction in the electrowinning of metals from acidic electrolytes. Zn electrowinning consumes a lot of electrical energy due to the high η O2 , so even a modest decrease in the η O2 would be beneficial for industry to save energy. The η O2 of the Ba-Co 9 /lead composite decreased by about 137 and 40 mV compared to pure Pb foil and Pb-0.75Ag alloy (commonly used in the hydrometallurgical industry), respectively. Therefore, the Ba-Co 9 /Pb composite could be a suitable substitute additive for Ag, with a strong potential industrial application.During these experiments, however, roughly 65% efficiency towards O 2 evolution was found, suggesting the occurrence of competing oxidations.

More recently, a PW 12 -modified Ag@Pt/MWCNT electrocatalyst was prepared by electrostatic interaction with positively charged chitosan-functionalized core-shell Ag@Pt NPs on MWCNTs. 261 The results showed that PW 12 improves the electrocatalytic activity of Ag@Pt NPs; with a E 1/2 (half-wave electrode potential) for the ORR which positively shifted 44 mV from that of Ag@Pt NPs/MWCNTs, and a mass activity (I m ) and specific area activity (I s ) about 2 times higher than those of Ag@Pt NPs/MWCNTs. The enhanced activity can be explained by the protective effect of the PW 12 layer on the catalyst surface.

        <p>Interestingly, Deng's group has developed a liquid-catalyst-mediated fuel cell (LCFC) employing only Mo-V-P POM solutions as electrocatalysts and constructed using a Nafion 115 membrane sandwiched between two 3D graphite electrodes with no metal loading. [265][266][267] In these cells, a Keggin-type H 3 PW 11 MoO 40 solution oxidizes the biomass under sunlight or heating (at the anode), while a modified (non-Keggin) H 12 P 3 Mo 18 V 7 O 85 aqueous solution leads to the reduction of oxygen (in the cathode). The two POM solutions have different redox potentials and, unlike noblemetal catalysts, have the advantage of being tolerant to catalyst-poisoning organic and inorganic contaminants. Therefore, raw biomasses, such as cellulose, starch, and even grass or wood powders can be used directly to produce electricity without prior purification. It is noteworthy that, contrary to conventional fuel cells, in which small molecules such as hydrogen and methanol are the best fuels, biomass fuels are more favorable for this novel LCFC with respect to their power densities. In another study, Mo-V-P POM solutions, H 3+x PV x Mo 12-x O 40 (x = 0, 2, and 3), were applied as redox mediators for the ORR in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. 268 In this electrochemical system, the POM is reduced over the carbon cathode, and then the resultant rPOM is re-oxidized by exposure to the dissolved oxygen in the regenerator. The substitution quantity of V in the POM significantly affected the onset reduction potential as well as the current density achieved; H 6 PV 3 Mo 9 O 40 was the most suitable mediator in terms of the electrochemical reduction property. The principle of using POM solutions and carbon as the cathode ORR catalyst can provide new methods for the improvement of other fuel cell systems.Interestingly, Deng's group has developed a liquid-catalyst-mediated fuel cell (LCFC) employing only Mo-V-P POM solutions as electrocatalysts and constructed using a Nafion 115 membrane sandwiched between two 3D graphite electrodes with no metal loading. [265][266][267] In these cells, a Keggin-type H 3 PW 11 MoO 40 solution oxidizes the biomass under sunlight or heating (at the anode), while a modified (non-Keggin) H 12 P 3 Mo 18 V 7 O 85 aqueous solution leads to the reduction of oxygen (in the cathode). The two POM solutions have different redox potentials and, unlike noblemetal catalysts, have the advantage of being tolerant to catalyst-poisoning organic and inorganic contaminants. Therefore, raw biomasses, such as cellulose, starch, and even grass or wood powders can be used directly to produce electricity without prior purification.

No current was observed initially at an applied potential of 1.1V, even in the presence of glucose. However, when a PMO 12 solution was pumped through the anode along with biomass, a sharp increase in the electrolysis current was observed together with the corresponding bubbles of H 2 gas at the cathode side as can be seen from Figure 21 (a,b). The use of POMs to produce H 2 at low electric energy consumption from biomass is very young but promising technology that remains to be deeply explored.

        <p>As an electrocatalyst in homogeneous conditions, decomposition reactions that yield a thin CoO x film on the anode can be easily avoided by the addition of chelating agents. After the reaction cycles, Co 9 can be recovered from solution by recrystallization with additional alkali-metal cations or by slow evaporation of the reaction medium. The Cs + insoluble salt of Co 9 can be blended into a carbon paste electrode to yield a robust catalytic process in the pH range from 1 -8.As an electrocatalyst in homogeneous conditions, decomposition reactions that yield a thin CoO x film on the anode can be easily avoided by the addition of chelating agents.

        <p>The reduction of molecular oxygen occurs inside fuel cells and metal-air batteries. The ORR follows very slow kinetics and has a very high overpotential. Therefore, significant research effort is devoted to improving this reaction. The reduction of molecular oxygen can occur through two pathways. First is the four-electron pathway, leading to the formation of water and second is the twoelectron pathway in which the product is hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). POMs are normally used as active centers for a reduction supported over a conducting substrate to transport the electrons and accelerate the reaction kinetics.The reduction of molecular oxygen occurs inside fuel cells and metal-air batteries.
