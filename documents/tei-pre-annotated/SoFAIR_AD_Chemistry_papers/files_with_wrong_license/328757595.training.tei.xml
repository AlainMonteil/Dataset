        <p>Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is recognized as a powerful and versatile chemoproteomic technology in drug discovery. Central to ABPP is the use of activity-based probes (ABPs) to report the activity of specific enzymes or reactivity of amino acid types in complex biological systems. Over the last two decades, ABPP has facilitated the identification of new drug targets and discovery of lead compounds in human and infectious disease. Furthermore, as part of a sustained global effort to illuminate the druggable proteome, the repertoire of target classes addressable with ABPs has vastly expanded in recent years. Here, we provide an overview of ABPP and summarise the major technological advances with an emphasis on probe development.</p>
        <p>Recent genetic evidence reveals a significant proportion of understudied proteins contribute to human disease [1]. Despite this, biomedical researchers typically focus on a narrow set of well-characterised targets [2], resulting in only ~10% of the human proteome being accessible to pharmacological modulation by antibodies or chemical tools [3]. There is an ongoing need to develop new tools and technologies to support identification of new drug targets and conception of novel therapeutic strategies.</p>
        <p>Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is a technique for monitoring the activity of enzymes in complex proteomes based on chemoproteomics -the combined application of chemical probes with quantitative proteomics. Since the 1990s, ABPP has been successfully used to characterise protein function, supporting the discovery of druggable targets and small molecule inhibitors [4]. Central to ABPP is the use of activity-based probes (ABPs), which are small molecules functionalised with; (1) an electrophilic warhead for covalent binding of specific amino acids on target proteins; (2) a linker that tunes the specificity of the ABP and/or minimises undesirable interactions between warhead and tag and; (3) a fluorescent and/or affinity tag for detection or purification of labelled targets (Fig. 1A). Following labelling, proteins can be visualised by in-gel fluorescence scanning of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, or enriched (typically via avidin-based enrichment of biotin-tagged targets) for downstream identification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; Fig. 1B) [4]. For MS-based analyses, enzyme activity can be quantitatively assessed in two or more samples using label-free quantification or isotopic labelling. In the latter approach, unique isotopic signatures are typically introduced into proteins or peptides through the use of isotopically-differentiated biotin tags, tandem mass tags (TMTs), or by Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) [5]. This is commonly applied to identify aberrant enzyme activity in disease models (Fig. 1Ci) or assess target engagement of small molecule inhibitors (Fig. 1Cii).</p>
        <p>Over the past two decades, ABPs have been developed for profiling the situational activity of a diverse range of enzymes classes [4,6]. These probes target conserved residues within the active site of their target proteins, with specificity driven by the mechanistic differences between enzyme families. Early examples of class-specific probes include the fluorophosphonates for labelling active-site of serine hydrolases and acyloxymethyl ketone (AOMK)-based probes for papain-like cysteine proteases [7,8]. Since these initial developments, probes have been developed for chemoselective profiling of diverse enzyme classes including cathepsins [9], legumains [10], caspases [11], proteasomal proteases [12], arginine methyltransferases [13], kinases [14], tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatases [15][16][17], glycosidases [18] and deubiquitinases [19]. Together, their applications have provided new insights into the functions of proteins in a variety of disease contexts [20][21][22],</p>
        <p>uncovering new biology and facilitating the identification of drugs and drug targets [23]. This review aims to provide an update on the technological advances in ABPP over the last two years. Here, we focus on the development of probes for new enzyme classes and amino acid types, highlighting the key insights in drug discovery that have been enabled through their application. We apologise to colleagues whose work may not have been mentioned due to space limitations. ABPs may be functionalised with affinity tags (e.g. biotin, depicted) and/or fluorophores (e.g. Alexa Fluor 488) for enrichment and visualisation of labelled species, respectively. Latent handles (e.g. azide or alkyne groups) may be incorporated to enable bioorthogonal ligation of tags via copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) [24]. B. General workflow of an ABPP experiment. Typically, proteomes are labelled in cells or in vitro with an ABP directed toward a particular enzyme class or amino acid type. If a fluorophore tag is used, labelled proteins are separated on by SDS-PAGE and directly visualised via fluorescence scanning. By contrast, biotinylated proteins are enriched on a streptavidin-immobilised resin and digested, generating probemodified peptides for analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Differences in the extent of protein labelling between two independent samples (e.g. healthy and diseased tissue) can be quantified or visualised, enabling the identification of new drug targets or sites for inhibitor development. C. Common applications of ABPP for target identification and in small molecule screens.</p>
        <p>Recent advances in class-specific profiling have focused on expanding the repertoire of enzymes targetable with ABPs. This includes proteins that mediate the addition ("writers") and removal ("erasers") of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and whose dysregulation is associated with the onset of a diverse range of human diseases [25]. For instance, Nemmara and colleagues developed a series of benzimadzole-alkyne probes for selective in-cell labelling of protein arginine deaminases (PADs) [26], which catalyse protein citrullination and are implicated in a range of malignant cancers and autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, ABPs have been developed for various components of the ubiquitin (Ub) protein degradation system (E1, E2, E3 enzymes and deubiquitinases; DUBs), whose aberrant activity can lead to neurodegeneration, developmental disorder or cancer [27]. Typically, these probes feature one or more full-length Ub moieties that serve as a common recognition element for Ubconjugating and deconjugating enzymes, and/or a C-terminal electrophile that binds to a catalytic cysteine residue within the active site of their respective target(s) (comprehensively reviewed in [28]). More recent work has involved tuning the specificity of probes toward distinct subclasses of enzymes. For instance, E2-Ub conjugates have been engineered to incorporate unnatural acids for selective labelling of RING and HECT family E3 ligases [29,30]). To overcome issues associated with cell impermeability of large Ub-based probes, peptide-and small molecule-based ABPs have been developed for profiling DUB activity in live cells [31][32][33]. In a recent study, Panyain and colleagues report the first selective cyanopyrrolidine probe for Ubiquitin Carboxy-Terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), and demonstrate its utility in identifying potent inhibitors for UCHL1-dependent pulmonary fibrosis [33]. In addition, small molecule ABPs have been used to determine the selectivity profiles of two putative covalent USP14/UCH-37 inhibitors, b-AP15 and VLX1570 (a phase I/II clinical trial candidate) [34]. Here, competitive ABPP experiments using alkyne-tagged analogues revealed that these compounds interact with many additional proteins beyond their reported targets, leading to the formation of large protein aggregates and cell death. While providing a molecular explanation for the cytotoxic chemotype of these inhibitors, this study emphasised the importance of using validated chemical tools for probing DUB activity.</p>
        <p>Metabolic enzymes have also received increased attention as targets for probe development. For example, Sieber and colleagues describe the development of clickable pyridoxal analogues for profiling the activity of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes (PLP-DEs) [35], which are widely recognised as important drug targets in infectious and human disease [36]. Here, proteomic profiling of PLP-DE activity in the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus revealed several potential targets for PLP-based drug development and was later successfully applied to screen off-target activity of the antituberculosis drug, Dcycloserine. However, one inherent limitation of using pyridoxal mimetics in prokaryotic cells is the requirement to ablate the biosynthesis of native PLP substrates, which otherwise compete with the probe for active site of PLP-DEs. As highlighted by the authors, this precludes full proteomic coverage of PLP-DEs in these systems and potentially misses important therapeutic targets. More recently, a broad-spectrum ABP, STA-55, was reported for the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family [37], which have roles in diverse metabolic pathways and are associated with a range of metabolic diseases including type II hyperprolinaemia and Sjögren-Larson syndrome [38]. In this study, the authors applied STA-55 to screen the selectivity profiles of published ALDH inhibitors in A549 lung cancer cells, highlighting their use in validating target engagement against this enzyme class. This revealed that putative ALDH inhibitors</p>
        <p>Nucleophilic amino acids facilitate diverse biochemical functions in proteins, ranging from enzyme catalysis to serving as sites for PTM. Moreover, electrophilic moieties that engage amino acid-associated nucleophiles are being increasingly incorporated into covalent ligands and drugs to enhance their selectivity, potency and/or pharmacokinetic properties [39,40].</p>
        <p>For instance, targeting of non-catalytic cysteines in oncogenic kinases has emerged as a successful strategy for enhancing the selectivity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, culminating in FDA approval of several covalent drugs for cancer treatment [41].</p>
        <p>The recent success of covalent inhibitors in the clinic has stimulated the development of chemical proteomic technologies to identify new nucleophilic sites for covalent targeting.</p>
        <p>One key advance has been 'reactivity-based profiling' (RBP), which is typically based on the isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis activity-based protein profiling (isoTOP-ABPP) platform [42]. IsoTOP-ABPP and related methods are reliant upon 'broad-spectrum reactivity probes' which possess an electrophilic warhead with preferential reactivity for a specific amino acid type(s) (Table 1). These probes do not typically possess any of the aforementioned structural elements (linkers, detection moieties). This increases cell permeability and minimises any possible structural contributions to probe-target binding energies, effectively eliminating any "specificity" elements not related to the chemistry of the warhead. For isoTOP-ABPP, a proteome is treated with two concentrations (e.g. 1× and 10×) of an alkyne-linked broad-spectrum reactive probe. These two independently labelled proteomes are then click-conjugated to biotin tags, combined, enriched, digested, and analysed by LC-MS/MS. Because peptides modified by the probe are directly detected, both the target protein and probe-modified residue(s) are identified. The underlying rationale for the method is that by comparing the extent of labelling between the two treatments, the reactivity of an individual labelled residue can be quantified; 'hyperreactive' sites label equally at high and low concentrations, whereas less reactive sites are only identified when the probe is present at saturating levels. Initially applied to rank cysteine reactivity in the human proteome using an iodoacetamide-alkyne (IA-alkyne) probe (Table 1) [42], hyperreactivity was found to be a predictor of cysteine functionality. This identified a key application for broad-spectrum RBP in identifying functional sites with potential druggability.</p>
        <p>Following its initial development, isoTOP-ABPP has since been adapted for competitive screening of endogenous and exogenous small molecules. Here, proteomes are pre-treated with a cysteine-reactive electrophile prior to probe labelling, and ligand binding at a given residue is assessed via a reduction in labelling relative to a vehicle-treated control. This has enabled the identification of cysteines that are sensitive to oxidative PTMs [43,44], as well as those targeted by natural products and FDA-approved inhibitors [45,46]. Furthermore, competitive isoTOP-ABPP has been applied for proteome-wide screening of cysteinereactive covalent fragments, facilitating the identification of reactive sites that can be pursued as targets in traditional site-directed ligand discovery [47].</p>
        <p>To further investigate proteins targetable with covalent inhibitors, researchers have expanded this technology to other amino acid types. To date, alkyne probes have been developed for chemoselective profiling of methionine [48], lysine [49], tyrosine [50], aspartate and glutamate (Table 1) [51,52], which together have facilitated the identification of new targets in a variety of disease contexts. For instance, Hacker and colleagues developed a lysine-directed sulphotetrafluorophenyl probe (STP-alkyne; Table 1) for competitive screening of amine-reactive fragments against the proteomes of three cancer cell lines [49].</p>
        <p>These studies revealed several hyperreactive and ligandable lysines in proteins considered to be 'undruggable' and/or lacking small-molecule probes. Furthermore, ligand binding was demonstrated to inhibit the activity of several metabolic enzymes through the disruption of active, allosteric and protein-protein interaction (PPI) sites. More recently, sulfur-triazole exchange (SuTEx) chemistry was introduced to facilitate the development of phenol-reactive probes for functional profiling of reactive tyrosines [50]. Originally applied to monitor the activation of phosphotyrosine sites in cancer cells via global inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase activity, the SuTEx platform was subsequently adapted for fragment-based ligand discovery [53]. Here, competitive screening of phenol-reactive 1,2,4-sulfonyl triazoles identified ligandable sites in several oncogenes that affected enzyme activity. This work highlighted tyrosine residues as viable therapeutic targets in ovarian and squamous cell lung carcinomas. Supporting the rapidly increasing applications of this ABPP approach, Bach and colleagues recently developed a series of photoactivatable 2,5-disubstituted tetrazoles for site-specific labelling of aspartates and glutamates (Table 1) [51]. Applied to the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus for competitive screening of carboxylic-acid-directed ligands, this study highlighted hydrazonyl chlorides as promising electrophiles for the development of covalent inhibitors targeting these amino acids.</p>
        <p>Future developments in RBP may involve the application to amino acids beyond those highlighted in this review. For example, while yet to be applied at the proteome level, chemistries have been developed for site-specific labelling of histidine [54] and tryptophan [55] residues in recombinant proteins. However, the identification and accurate quantification of probe-labelled sites remains a major challenge in residue-centric proteomics. For instance, MS1-based quantification (e.g. SILAC) is often performed using complex bespoke data analysis pipelines (e.g. 
            <rs type="software">CIMAGE</rs>) [42], which may not be easily implemented in nonspecialist labs. Furthermore, these commonly used methods are limited in their multiplexing capacity, with only two samples typically being analysed in a single MS run. The recent integration of isobaric tagging (e.g. TMT) into ABPP workflows has enabled analysis of 10 samples in parallel [56], and may increase the accessibility of multiplexed peptide/protein quantification. However, these MS2 labelling approaches require advanced triple-stage MS (MS3) methods to remove 'ratio compression' [57], a phenomenon in which coeluting peptides distort the differences in TMT reporter ion abundance between samples.
        </p>
        <p>A recent advance in ABP technology is the development of photoactivatable probes, which fall into two main categories; photoreactive and photocaged. As depicted in Figure 1A, the typical workflow of ABPP relies upon covalent binding of an ABP to its target protein(s). This has limited the application of this technology to target classes where covalent binding mechanisms are chemically accessible. However, profiling targets of reversible, noncovalent, small molecules is often required. Photoreactive probes incorporate an additional moiety, which upon irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light form highly reactive, radical species. This radical then drives the formation of a covalent bond between the probe and reversibly bound proteins (Fig. 2A). The reactivity and instability of the radical typically helps ensure that only direct targets of the probe are covalently modified [58,59]. Common photoreactive groups include benzophenones [60], diazirines [61] and aryl azides [62] (Fig. 2A). Recently, these have been successfully incorporated into ABPs to facilitate the identification of targets of diaminoquinazolines and truncated myosin A peptides in the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum [63,64], and the engagement of inhibitors for cannabinoid receptors [65] and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) [61].</p>
        <p>Prioritisation of potential targets identified by ABPP is one of the fundamental challenges the field faces. While efforts are made to enhance specificity, reactive electrophiles will invariably bind to a multitude of proteins. In addition to facilitating the profiling of proteins which cannot be targeted by covalent small molecules, photoreactive probes were used in a recent study into the stereoselectivity of protein targets, and how this may be used to aid in target prioritisation. Eight pairs of ABPs were synthesised, all of which incorporated photoreactive diazirine moieties and differed only in absolute stereochemistry, and screened in cell-based assays. Over one hundred and fifty of the identified proteins exhibited stereo-specific interactions, with only one stereoisomer of the enantioprobe pair engaging the target. Where target enrichment was seen with several enantioprobes, stereospecific interactions were exhibited with only one probe pair. Protein targets identified spanned wide functional and structural classes, and several were previously unidentified. Known ligands were shown to inhibit enantioprobe binding, validating probe engagement of functional targets.</p>
        <p>Enantioprobes can be used to prioritise targets, with only probes exhibiting stereoselective interactions taken forward for further medicinal chemistry studies. This novel ABPP technique not only enhances field-wide knowledge of the druggable proteome but may be useful in future medicinal chemistry studies to develop high-affinity and suitably selective inhibitors [56]. It is however worth noting that this study did not rule out the possibility that stereo-specific interactions were as a result of preferential proximity of the photo-reactive group to the protein in one enantiomer, leading to enhanced binding affinity.</p>
        <p>Photocaged probes incorporate a protecting group on the probe's electrophilic warhead, which is cleaved upon exposure to specific wavelengths of UV light. In effect the probe's reactivity is masked until the electrophile is uncaged, enabling cell concentration of the probe to equilibrate before labeling and preventing probe interactions with membrane thiols and reactive lipids. This increases spatial and temporal control over target engagement, which can be restricted to a specific cellular region, or a specific time point during treatment [66] (Fig. 2B). Photo-caging strategies rely on validated protecting groups (Fig. 2B) and have only recently been applied to ABPP, with their use to-date limited to profiling the reactivity of cysteines [66,67]. In this study the authors demonstrated that photocaging of an iodoacetamide probe limited broad-spectrum reactivity and mass offtarget engagement, providing notable benefits including reduced cytotoxicity and decreased background readings [67]. As implementation of this technique remains limited, effects of the caging group on probe-protein binding affinity and effective cellular distribution are yet to be ruled out as potential drawbacks.</p>
        <p>The classes of enzyme and amino acid now addressable with ABPs have expanded tremendously over recent years. Collectively, the application of these probes to a diverse range of biological systems has facilitated the discovery of novel drug targets and inhibitors in a variety of disease contexts, which serve as a strong foundation for the rational design of next-generation therapeutics. Considering persistent global health challenges such as antimicrobial resistance, there remains a continual need to expand the druggable proteome and develop new mechanistic classes of drugs. With new advances in synthetic chemistry and the advent of exciting global initiatives such as Target 2035 (which aims to develop pharmacological tools to study the entire human proteome by 2035) [1], it can be anticipated that the extent of protein classes targetable by ABPP will rise exponentially in the near future. Future developments could also involve expanding the ABPP workflow to target other biomolecules, such as nucleic acids. By coupling traditional enrichment methods with a nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) readout, it may be possible to quantitatively profile reactive sites within clinically-relevant DNA or RNA (e.g. regulatory or ribosomal RNAs), aiding the development new therapeutic strategies.</p>
        <p>Recent developments in stereospecific profiling of protein-fragment interactions has provided powerful means to prioritise ligandable sites as prospective targets. Despite these advances, the selection of identified targets for downstream investigation remains biased, and is typically based on the availability of assays and/or functional information for the associated protein. As a result, uncharacterised targets with potential therapeutic value are often overlooked. Moreover, there currently exists no method for expedient prioritisation of enzymes, reactive or ligandable amino acids as targets following their proteomic identification. Current genetic approaches for functional characterisation of proteins and/or specific amino acid residues involve time-consuming complementation and mutagenesis strategies. Hence, there is a clear need to develop technologies that enable functional prioritisation of reactive sites and the full realisation of ABPP's remarkable potential. With the advent of genome editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9, the functional characterisation of proteins and reactive sites is now possible at a systems level. Thus, integration of such technologies with ABPP into systematic 'multi-omics' platforms for target prioritisation may address a bottleneck in the early drug discovery pipeline and facilitate the expansion of the druggable proteome. Indeed, CRISPR-based saturated mutagenesis screens have been developed to assess the functionality of amino acids within individual genes and at multiple loci across genomes [71][72][73]. However, to our knowledge, these approaches have yet been applied in a residue-specific manner to interrogate reactive sites identified in ABPP experiments.</p>
