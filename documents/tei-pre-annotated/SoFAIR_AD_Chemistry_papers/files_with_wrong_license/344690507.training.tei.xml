        <p>Metrics &amp; More Article Recommendations * sı Supporting Information CONSPECTUS: The field of metallosupramolecular chemistry is clearly dominated by the use of O-N-, and P-donor Werner-type polydentate ligands. These molecular architectures are of high interest because of their wide range of applications, which include molecular encapsulation, stabilization of reactive species, supramolecular catalysis, and drug delivery, among others. Only recently, organometallic ligands have allowed the preparation of a variety of supramolecular coordination complexes, and the term supramolecular organometallic complexes (SOCs) is gaining space within the field of metallosupramolecular chemistry. While the early examples of SOCs referred to supramolecular architectures mostly containing bisalkenyl, diphenyl, or bisalkynyl linkers, the development of SOCs during the past decade has been boosted by the parallel development of multidentate N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. The first examples of NHC-based SOCs referred to supramolecular assemblies based on polydentate NHC ligands bound to group 11 metals. However, during the last 10 years, several planar poly-NHC ligands containing extended π-conjugated systems have facilitated the formation of a large variety of architectures in which the supramolecular assemblies can contain metals other than Cu, Ag, and Au. Such ligands are Janus di-NHCs and trigonal-planar tris-NHCsmost of them prepared by our research groupwhich have allowed the preparation of a vast range of NHC-based metallosupramolecular compounds with interesting hostguest chemistry properties.</p>
        <p>Although the number of SOCs has increased in the past few years, their use for host-guest chemistry purposes is still in its earliest infancy. In this Account, we describe the achievements that we have made during the last 4 years toward broadening the applications of planar extended π-conjugated NHC ligands for the preparation of organometallic-based supramolecular structures, including their use as hosts for some selected organic and inorganic guests, together with the catalytic properties displayed by some selected host-guest inclusion complexes. Our contribution describes the design of several Ni-, Pd-, and Au-based metallorectangles and metalloprisms, which we used for the encapsulation of several organic substrates, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and fullerenes. The large binding affinities found are ascribed to the incorporation of two cofacial panels with large π-conjugated systems, which provide the optimum conditions for guest recognition by π-π-stacking interactions.</p>
        <p>We also describe a series of digold(I) metallotweezers for the recognition of organic and inorganic substrates. These metallotweezers were used for the recognition of "naked" metal cations and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The recognition properties of these metallotweezers are highly dependent on the nature of the rigid connector and of the ancillary ligands that constitute the arms of the tweezer. A peculiar balance between the self-aggregation properties of the tweezer and its ability to encapsulate organic guests is observed.</p>
        <p>Metallosupramolecular chemistry refers to the field of research involving the combination of bridging organic ligands with metal units that form discrete or polymeric assemblies of different shapes and sizes. 1 Over the last three decades, coordinationdriven self-assembly has become a widespread strategy for the From the ligand perspective, metallosupramolecular chemistry is clearly dominated by the use of O-, N-, and P-donor Wernertype polydentate ligands, while only a few examples of assemblies bearing carbon donor ligands have been reported in the literature. However, during the past decade, the number of organometallic-based supramolecular assemblies has grown fast and parallel to the development of multidentate N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, 4 and a number of review articles were published recently. 5 The rapid development of supramolecular assemblies with organometallic ligands is exemplified by the establishment of the term supramolecular organometallic complexes (SOCs), coined by Poẗhig and Casini in 2019, 5c to refer to complexes in which the (organic) linker forms the organometallic bond to the metal node. This means that the carbon-metal bond is structurally crucial for the formation of the architecture of the resulting SOC, in contrast to those assemblies that do not have organometallic-based ligands or those whose organometallic ligands (normally η 5 -Cp or η 6arene) cap the metal nodes.</p>
        <p>Most NHC-based SOCs are supramolecular assemblies based on polydentate NHC ligands bound to group 11 metals. The reason for this is that these metals often display linear coordination modes that facilitate trans coordination of the NHC ligands, thereby forming assemblies in which the metal atoms are sandwiched between the two polydentate NHC ligands. In addition, the NHC-M bond (M = Cu, Ag, Au) is usually labile, which allows the formation of the thermodynamically most stable assemblies from mixtures of the metal precursors and the poly-NHC. These assemblies include rectangles, triangles, 6 and cylinders, 7 such as the ones shown s1 in Scheme 1.</p>
        <p>However, during the last 10 years, several planar polyconjugated poly-NHC ligands have facilitated the formation of a variety of structures in which the supramolecular assemblies can contain metals other than Cu, Ag, and Au. 8 The use of the Janus s2 di-NHC ligands A-E (Scheme 2) allows the synthesis of supramolecular assemblies whose dimensions may range from 6 Å as established by triazolylidene ligand A 8a to almost 23 Å when the nanosized di-NHC with the quinoxalinophenanthrophenazine core E 8e is used. Among these, the benzobis-(imidazolylidene) ligand B described by Bielawski in 2005 9 was the first one to demonstrate its suitability for the preparation of organometallic-based assemblies. Some threefold-symmetric tri-NHCs, such as F and G, have also been prepared. 8d,f,10 Hahn's group was the first one to exploit the linear arrangement of B for the preparation of a number of squareand rectangular-shaped assemblies that included metals such as gold, 11 iridium, 12 platinum, 13 palladium, 12b and nickel 14 s3 (Scheme 3). Together with the use of this benzobis-(imidazolylidene) ligand, Hahn also used a structurally similar di(NH,O)-NHC ligand for the preparation of a large number of molecular squares. 6a,b The benzobis(NHC) ligand B establishes a metal-to-metal separation of 10.5 Å, which in most cases is too small to build cavities of the appropriate size to host organic guests. This is probably the reason why none of the organometallic assemblies displayed in Scheme 3 were used for host-guest chemistry purposes.</p>
        <p>Although the number of SOCs has increased in the past few years, those used for host-guest chemistry purposes are still very few. Some recent relevant examples of SOCs used for the encapsulation of organic substrates were described by Altmann and Poẗhig, 15 who developed organometallic-based rotaxanes consisting of Ag 8 and Au 8 pillarplexes, which are highly selective ). 20 The orthogonal 147 disposition of the two aromatic hands of the receptor made us 148 consider that the term metallofolders would be more accurate to 149 refer to this subclass of metallotweezers. By taking advantage of 150 the void space between the polyaromatic panels, these 151 complexes were used as receptors of electron-deficient organic 152 molecules such as 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCNB), 2,4,7-153 trinitro-9-fluorenone (TNFLU), and 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetra-154 carboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA). Although the host-guest 155 association constants were low, we observed that the receptors 156 were able to discriminate between electron-rich and electron-157 deficient aromatic substrates. Besides, we observed that 158 molecule 6 containing the phenanthrophenazine panel was a 159 more effective receptor than molecule 5 containing pyrene, most 160 likely because of the larger surface area provided by the former 161 one, which renders a more effective π-π-stacking interaction 162 with the guests. 20 The relatively low binding affinities shown by these two receptors are due to the orthogonal disposition of the two polyaromatic panels, which prevents their cooperative π-πstacking interaction with the guests, as would have probably happened if the two panels were disposed in a parallel manner.</p>
        <p>Our next approach for the preparation of metallotweezers was s6 the synthesis of complex 7 (Scheme 6), which contains two Au(I) pyrene-imidazolylidene arms connected by a 1,8diethynylanthracene linker. 21 In principle, this metallotweezer should show interesting recognition abilities since the two polyaromatic panels are parallel and separated by approximately 7 Å. However, the supramolecular properties of 7 are markedly determined by its tendency to self-aggregate. In a nonpolar solvent such as benzene, 7 self-aggregates to form the duplex complex (7) 2 (Scheme 6). This self-complementary duplex complex is formed by the encapsulation of the anthracenyl linker of each tweezer between the two pyrene-functionalized arms of the complementary one. The molecular structure of the complex shows that the four gold atoms form a rectangle displaying strong aurophilic interactions between the pairs of gold atoms of complementary tweezers. In the presence of "naked" metal cations (Cu + , Ag + , or Tl + ), the tweezer is able to self-aggregate in We were interested in studying how subtle modifications of the structure of 7 would affect the supramolecular properties of the resulting complex. We first obtained the new metallotweezer s7 8 (Scheme 7) in which we changed the pyrene-imidazolylidene ligand to a smaller benzoimidazolylidene. 22 It was anticipated that this would reduce the ability of the complex to selfaggregate because the π-delocalized surface area of the ligand is smaller than that shown by the pyrene-functionalized ligand in 7.</p>
        <p>In fact, we observed that in the absence of an external stimulus, 8</p>
        <p>does not show any tendency to self-aggregate. However, the with the concomitant formation of 8. In addition, while solutions of the thallium-trapped species Tl@(8) 2 were stable for days, the compounds containing copper and silver evolved into a polymer (Cu) or an oligomer (Ag) (Scheme 7). 22 The different reactivity patterns shown by 8 and the pyrene-containing tweezer 7 are explained because π-π-stacking interactions are less likely to be produced in 8, and therefore, the molecule may self-aggregate, but the process is reversible and may also give rise to more complex structures such as oligomers and polymers.</p>
        <p>Once we studied the self-aggregation properties of tweezers 7</p>
        <p>and 8, we became interested in studying the cation-triggered aggregates. 23 As depicted in Scheme 8, the reactions of The 235 reactions between the homocomplex dimers containing thallium 236 or silver also evolved to the related mixed-ligand hetero-237 complexes 9, thus indicating that 9 is the thermodynamically 238 (rather than kinetically) favored species. The formation of 9 was 239 assumed to be a consequence of the maximization of the π-π-240 stacking and metallophilic interactions in the aggregated 241 structures. 23 Other examples of self-sorting phenomena shown 242 by NHC-based assemblies have been reported recently. 6c,24 243 As can be seen from the description of the properties of 7 and 244 8, it became evident that their supramolecular properties are 245 determined by their tendency to self-aggregate. In order to use a 246 metallotweezer for the recognition of aromatic substrates, we 247 needed to minimize the self-aggregation tendency so that the 248 two polyaromatic arms of the receptor would be exclusively used to trap a potential aromatic guest. In order to reduce the selfcomplementary character of the tweezers, we thought of two different strategies. The first involved designing a new metallotweezer with a linker in which the π-extended system is disrupted, so that its participation in the π-π-stacking event is s9 less likely to occur (Scheme 9, strategy 1). The second strategy consists of using a linker with two diverging alkynyl ligands, so that the two polyaromatic arms of the tweezer are separated by a distance that prevents their participation in the self-aggregation process (Scheme 9, strategy 2).</p>
        <p>To implement the first strategy, we prepared U-shaped digold metallotweezer 10 with a bis(alkynyl)xanthene connector s10 (Scheme 10). 25 This metallotweezer acts as metalloligand in the presence of Cu + , Tl + , or Ag + , and we observed that the coordination ability of the metalloligand was highly dependent Accounts of Chemical Research F alkynyls and to the oxygen of the xanthene linker. In addition, the copper(I) atom is also a very short distance from the Au atoms, indicating strong metallophilic interactions. The reaction of 10 with Tl + affords a complex in which the ligand acts as a trans-κ 2 chelate ligand through two Tl-Au metallophilic interactions (12). The reaction with Ag + leads to a selfassembled structure with two silver cations encased inside the cavity of a duplex structure formed by two self-assembled metallotweezers (13). The reason for the formation of this structure is found in the core of the molecule, in which it can be observed that the two silver atoms maximize all possible interactions with the binding sites of the metalloligand (alkynyls and gold atoms) with additional stabilization by the formation of a Ag-Ag argentophilic bond (Scheme 10). 25 The second strategy that we used to avoid the self-association of the metallotweezers was to use a linker with two diverging alkynyl groups. Complex 14 contains a bis(alkynyl)carbazole connector with two pyrene-imidazolylidene-Au(I) arms. As can be observed from the molecular structure of the complex f1 (Figure 1a), the two pyrene moieties are separated by a distance of 9.3 Å, which is too large to facilitate the self-aggregation of the complex. 26 However, the two arms are flexible enough to reduce this distance to 6.9 Å so that the two pyrene arms can approach the surface of a polyaromatic guest such as 3-perylenylmethanol (Figure 1b), facilitating maximum face-to-face overlap.</p>
        <p>Complex 14 was used for the recognition of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The compound is able to bind these planar polyaromatic guests as a result of the π-π-stacking interactions between the polyaromatic guests and the pyrene moieties of the NHC ligand. 26 In addition, the presence of the NH group in the carbazole tether strengthens the binding of those PAHs functionalized with groups capable of hydrogen bonding, as concluded from our experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies. The association constants of these guests are up to 1 order of magnitude larger than those shown by unfunctionalized PAHs. For example, the association constant between 14 and pyrene is 10 M -1 in 305 toluene, while the constant with 1-pyrenylmethanol is 340 M -1 , 306 s11 as shown in Scheme 11. Similarly, the association constant of 14 307 with perylene is 145 M -1 , while the constant with 3-308 perylenylmethanol is 1350 M -1 . 26 These findings demonstrate 309 that the combination of π-π-stacking and hydrogen-bonding 310 interactions can be used for the rational design of more efficient 311 metalloreceptors. With these results in hand, we thought that the introduction of this type of ligand into the structure of closed metallocages should produce metallosupramolecular assemblies with enhanced host-guest chemistry abilities. Given our previous results on the preparation of gold-based metallotweezers, we aimed to obtain a set of new metallocages by replacing the mono-NHC ligands by di-and tri-NHC ligands connected by extended πconjugated systems. Using this strategy and the bis(alkynyl)carbazole linker that we previously used for the preparation of metallotweezer 14, we prepared metallorectangle 17, 28 trigonalprismatic metallocage 18, 29 and rhombohedral metallocyclo-s14 phane 19 30 (Scheme 14). Interestingly, the nanosized nature of the structures shown in Scheme 14, together with the presence of the two cofacial polycyclic-conjugated panels in 17 and 18, made these two latter assemblies very effective for the encapsulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In particular, the hexagold prismatic cage 18 with the triphenylenetris-(NHC) ligand has a "slotlike" cavity with a volume of ∼300 Å 3 and a height of 7 Å. This cage shows a very large binding affinity for coronene, which makes it serve as an excellent coronene scavenger in CH 2 Cl 2 . 29 The perfect dimensional match between 18 and coronene can be visualized in the structure shown in Accounts of Chemical Research 3.3. Metallorectangles, Metallosquares, and Metallocages of Ni and Pd 3.3.1. Nickel. Pyrenebis(NHC) ligand C (Scheme 2) used in the preparation of tetragold(I) complex 17 turned out to be a very useful synthon for the preparation of metallosupramolecular structures with metals other than gold. By the use of this di-NHC ligand, two nickel-cornered metallorectangles were prepared whose dimensions were modulated by using either pyrazine or 4,4′-bipyridine. 32 The metal-to-metal distance established by the pyrenebis(imidazolylidene) ligands is ∼13 Å, while the distances along the N-donor ligands are 7 and 11 Å s15 for pyrazine and bipyridine, respectively (Scheme 15). These molecular rectangles were used for the encapsulation of PAHs. Because of their dimensions, pyrazine-containing rectangle 20 was able to host only one molecule of the polyaromatic guest, while rectangle 21 containing bipyridine was capable of hosting f4 up to two guest molecules. Figure 4 shows the molecular structure of (pyrene) 2 @21, where it can be observed that effective π-π-stacking interactions are established both between the pyrene guest molecules and between the pyrene guests and the pyrene moieties of the di-NHC ligands. The association constants of the aromatic guests with both receptors were determined in acetone-d 6 . The results showed that a good fit between the size of the PAH and the binding constant could be 34 The encapsulating properties of this metallosquare are clearly determined by the presence of the four pyrene panels, which endows the compound a three-dimensional shape. This metallosquare was used for the encapsulation of C 60 and C 70 . The metallosquare is shape-adaptable in the sense that it can adjust to accommodate the size of the encapsulated fullerene. The pyrene panels bend in order to adapt their shapes to maximize the face-to-face overlap with the convex surface of the fullerene (see Scheme 17), and this also modifies the guest-available volume of the cavity. For example, the distances between the center points of opposite pyrene panels in C 60 @23 are significantly shorter than the related distances in C 70 @23 (Scheme 17). The cage exhibits a higher affinity for C 70 over C 60 , and the thermodynamic parameters obtained from the determination of the association constants at different temperatures show that the binding process is entropically driven, and thus dominated by desolvation rather than intrinsic interactions between the electrondeficient fullerenes and the electron-rich faces of the pyrene moieties of the metallosquare. 34 An important feature of C 60 @23 and C 70 @23 is that both host-guest complexes behaved as photochemically stable singlet oxygen photosensitizers. 35 Both host-guest complexes 16 studies can be directed to prospect the biological applications of this type of system, possibly by including in the NHC scaffolds further functionalities that can target biological units (i.e., peptides), which to date has been mostly explored with small molecules. 38 Efforts can also be directed toward the reversible encapsulation of homogeneous catalysts, which may be released on demand by the addition of, for example, an additive guest with a higher binding affinity with the receptor.</p>
