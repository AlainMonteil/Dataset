        <p>One of the main challenges in the field of 3D printing/vat photopolymerization is the poor adaption of existing commercial photoinitiators (PIs) for the recently popular 3D printers with the irradiation wavelength at 405 nm. It is thus desirable to design and develop high-performance PIs which can work efficiently at this wavelength. In this work, different ketones were specifically designed by molecular modeling for good light absorption properties at 405 nm and the best theoretical structures showing intense violet/blue light absorption were synthesized for further investigation. The new proposed ketones were used in conjunction with different tertiary amines (e.g. ethyl dimethylaminobenzoate (EDB) or triethanolamine (TEA)) and iodonium salt as photoinitiating systems (PISs) for the photopolymerization of trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and Ebecryl 40 (a tetrafunctional polyether acrylate) via an oxidationreduction reaction mechanism. The results demonstrate that several ketone-based PISs can initiate free radical photopolymerization. The final conversions of Ebecryl 40 resin are higher than those of TMPTA, particularly in the presence of TEA. In addition, the light absorption properties and the photoinitiation mechanisms are also studied using UV-Visible absorption spectra, cyclic voltammetry, and fluorescence approaches. Moreover, the formation of the radicals is clearly determined by the electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping experiments. Finally, the developed ketone-based three-component systems are applied to the generation of macroscopically stereoscopic letter patterns using the 3D printing technique.One of the main challenges in the field of 3D printing/vat photopolymerization is the poor adaption of existing commercial photoinitiators (PIs) for the recently popular 3D printers with the irradiation wavelength at 405 nm.

        <p>3D printing/vat photopolymerization has previously been known as prototyping and additive manufacturing. Nowadays, several three-dimensional objects have been successively established in academic laboratories by coating down layers of materials. [1][2][3] The free radical photopolymerization process provides a useful account among various 3D printing technologies. 4,5 Indeed, by using the photopolymerization approach, a number of cross-sectional studies suggest that liquid resins can be solidified on irradiated areas using low-cost and safe violet LEDs (@405 nm) to produce 3D objects. [6][7][8][9][10] This approach could provide an important opportunity to advance the application of the stereolithography technique or 3D printing. [11][12][13][14][15] Recently, LED-activated polymerization initiated by photoinitiators (PIs) has been investigated by a number of research groups in materials science for polymerization due to its advantages including safety, spatial control, and highly efficient processes under mild conditions. [16][17][18][19][20] However, one of the main obstacles for photopolymerization used in 3D printing is that existing photoinitiators are not fully adapted to the current irradiation wavelength of 405 nm. [21][22][23][24][25] In this context, an original approach is proposed here through rational design by mole-cular modeling of specific photoinitiators for this attractive wavelength. More particularly, a large number of chromophores based on the ketone scaffold (more than 150) were investigated and the structures with excellent predicted light absorption properties at 405 nm were selected for synthesis and more detailed photochemical investigations. This in silico photoinitiator design is very rarely reported in the literature.3D printing/vat photopolymerization has previously been known as prototyping and additive manufacturing.

        <p>Research on the combination of iodonium salts and amines as versatile initiating systems for photochemical applications has been recently reported by our group. 26,27 In the present paper, the active photoinitiating systems will be composed of three specific components: heterocyclic group-substituted ketones, amines and iodonium salt. These chromophores were designed and selected based on their good near UV and visible light absorption properties predicted by molecular modeling and synthesized from these calculated data in a second step showing the interest of the molecular modeling design for the development of new photoinitiators. Remarkably, the synthesis of these derivatives is also quite straightforward, which is a great advantage of the new proposed systems. Interestingly, 3 ketones (ketones 7, 8, and 9) were never synthesized.Research on the combination of iodonium salts and amines as versatile initiating systems for photochemical applications has been recently reported by our group. 26,27 In the present paper, the active photoinitiating systems will be composed of three specific components: heterocyclic group-substituted ketones, amines and iodonium salt.

        <p>Specifically, we propose to develop novel photoinitiating systems (PISs) combining a new series of ketones acting as photoinitiators, amines (electron donors) such as ethyl dimethylaminobenzoate (EDB) or triethanolamine (TEA) and/or iodonium salt (electron acceptor) as co-initiators. The photoinitiation abilities of the newly proposed PISs on benchmark monomers [i.e. trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and Ebecryl 40 (a tetrafunctional polyether acrylate)] will be investigated using time-resolved Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. This is the first time we systematically studied the effects of ketones used in three-component photoinitiating systems on the polymerization kinetics of multifunctional acrylate monomers (TMPTA and Ebecryl 40) under 405 nm LED irradiation in detail. Moreover, the photochemical mechanisms of the most efficient ketone-based initiating systems will be investigated by UV-vis, cyclic voltammetry, and ESR experiments. The excited state processes, the redox properties and the free radical generation will be discussed in detail. Furthermore, we applied the three component photoinitiating systems to 3D printing, and some tridimensional patterns with gradient resolutions could be obtained. Remarkably, exceptional bleaching properties were observed for ketones 9 and 10 that can be very useful for potential applications; such bleaching properties show that the ketone is poorly regenerated, preventing its use in a catalytic cycle.Specifically, we propose to develop novel photoinitiating systems (PISs) combining a new series of ketones acting as photoinitiators, amines (electron donors) such as ethyl dimethylaminobenzoate (EDB) or triethanolamine (TEA) and/or iodonium salt (electron acceptor) as co-initiators.

        <p>The abilities of all the ketone-based three-component photoinitiating systems for the polymerization of acrylate monomers were investigated. Typical acrylate function conversion vs. irradiation time profiles obtained using RT-FTIR are given in Fig. 1. For the TMPTA monomer, the highest final conversion (FC) of the acrylate function groups in the presence of ketone (1 to 10)/Iod/amine was about 67% (ketone 5) after LED irradiation for 400 seconds. In the case of Ebecryl 40, the FCs were higher than those of TMPTA except the one initiated by ketone 5-based PISs. The specific data of TMPTA or Ebecryl 40 conversions are clearly illustrated in Tables S1 andS2, † respectively. When using triethanolamine (TEA) as an electron donor in ketone/Iod/amine PISs, the highest FC (for ketone 8/Iod/TEA) was increased significantly, and beyond 70% can be attained after the LED irradiation for 400 seconds. Moreover, compared with TMPTA, Ebecryl 40 led to more efficient processes. The use of TEA instead of EDB also improved the polymerization efficiency. Typical acrylate function conversion-time profiles for the same photoinitiating systems are given in Fig. 1a and the FCs are summarized in Table 1. As illustrated, the ketones 8, 9, and 10 proved to be excellent candidates to promote the photopolymerization efficiency and FCs of Ebecryl 40 in the presence of TEA.

Photolysis of the ketones 8, 9, and 10 in the presence of iodonium salt and amine can be characterized by using a UV-visible spectrometer. The UVvis spectra are depicted in Fig. 2. The photolysis quantum yields were not determined, and the aim of these experiments was to highlight the different ketone/additive interactions. An obvious and significant decline of the UV-vis absorption was observed for photoinitiating systems comprising ketone 8, ketone 9, and ketone 10. Before irradiation, the maximum absorption of ketones 8, 9, and 10 appeared at 440 nm, 403 nm, and 405 nm, respectively. However, after irradiation with an LED at 405 nm, obvious intensity decreases were observed for all the three ketones. Interestingly, the reaction process in the photoinitiating system with ketone 8 costs ∼50 min, while others cost only less than 1 min. According to the proposed mechanism shown in Scheme 3, the reaction process can be divided into two parts: (1) the ketones in combination with iodonium salt and (2) ketones in combination with amine.

        <p>In the UV-visible absorption spectra presented above, all three ketone-based photoinitiating systems exhibited relatively high reactivity which was in agreement with the final conversions of the acrylate functions and also rates of polymerization initiated by these PISs. As strong evidence to the presence of ketone/Iod or ketone/amine interactions, the peaks of ketones (characterized by significant absorption at 425 &lt; λ &lt; 475 nm for ketone 8; 375 &lt; λ &lt; 425 nm of ketone 9; 375 &lt; λ &lt; 425 nm of ketone 10) are disappearing in any case. However, the photolysis process of ketone 8/Iod or ketone 8/amine in acetonitrile under irradiation with an LED at 405 nm is very slow (about 50 min for disappearance of peaks, see Fig. 3a and4a), while the very high photosensitivity of the ketone 9, 10/Iod or ketone 9, 10/amine combinations can be observed which took less than 60 s (Fig. 3b, c, 4b andc). Therefore, two-component PISs based on ketones 9 or 10 exhibited stronger activity than ketone 8. Overall, ketone 8 showed favorable photostability during the photolysis process upon exposure to the 405 nm LED owing to its lower extinction coefficients (ε @405 = 7530 M -1 cm -1 ; see Table 2) which could hinder the efficiency of photolysis, compared to ketones 9 and 10 with high extinction coefficients (ε @405 = 52 130 and 32 070 M -1 cm -1 , respectively; see Table 2).

Therefore, two-component PISs based on ketones 9 or 10 exhibited stronger activity than ketone 8. Overall, ketone 8 showed favorable photostability during the photolysis process upon exposure to the 405 nm LED owing to its lower extinction coefficients (ε @405 = 7530 M -1 cm -1 ; see Table 2) which could hinder the efficiency of photolysis, compared to ketones 9 and 10 with high extinction coefficients (ε @405 = 52 130 and 32 070 M -1 cm -1 , respectively; see Table 2). Moreover, new absorption at 300 nm &lt; λ &lt; 350 nm in UV spectra were observed in the presence of ketones 9 and 10.</p>
        <p>3.2.2. Consumption of ketones in photolysis reactions. The percentage of consumption of ketones vs. irradiation time is also summarized from changes in their respective UV-vis spectra by comparing three-component PISs (ketone/Iod/ amine) with two-component PISs (ketone/Iod or ketone/ amine), which is illustrated in Fig. 5. According to Fig. 5a, it is obvious that percentages of consumption of ketone 8 achieved by the three-component PIS (ketone 8/Iod/amine) and twocomponent PIS (ketone 8/Iod) are much higher than those of ketone 8/amine combinations, e.g. consumption of ketone 8 = 65% for ketone 8/Iod/amine and 55% for ketone 8/Iod vs. 35% for ketone 8/amine. For the three-component systems, we proposed that r1, r2 and r3 occurred in ketone 8, 9 and 10/Iod/ amine systems. The generated radicals are given in Scheme 3. However, the ketone 8/amine two-component PIS interaction was very inefficient for which a weak interaction was observed compared to ketone 9 or 10/amine systems.3.2.2.

        <p>Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5b, for the same irradiation time, the ketone 9/Iod could achieve the highest consumption of ketone, while the ketone/Iod/amine led to the lowest consumption. Moreover, it is proposed that EDB •+ radical can be formed by electron transfer from EDB, as an N-aromatic electron donor to ketones (r4), and ketone can be regenerated from ketone-H • in the presence of iodonium salt (r5), which decelerated the consumption of ketones. In the case of the ketone 10/Iod/amine system, the consumption profile of ketone 10 with the three-component PIS (ketone 10/Iod/amine) was quite close to that reached when using two-component PISs based on ketone 10/Iod or ketone 10/amine combinations: i.e. the consumption of ketone 10 for 3 PISs reached 75%-80% (see Fig. 5c).Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5b, for the same irradiation time, the ketone 9/Iod could achieve the highest consumption of ketone, while the ketone/Iod/amine led to the lowest consumption.

        <p>However, the photolysis processes of ketones 1 to 6/Iod/ amine under irradiation with the LED at 405 nm were very fast (Fig. S2a-f †) compared to that of ketone 7 (see Fig. S2g †) which lasted ∼300 min (Fig. S2g †). A similar behavior was observed for the photolysis of ketone 8 mentioned above.

        <p>3.2.4. Cyclic voltammetry and fluorescence experiments to study the electron transfer reaction for ketones. The electron transfer was found to be favorable for ketone 8, 9, and 10based systems, which was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry experiments (Fig. 6). In our work, each cyclic voltammogram was obtained by scanning between 0 and 2000 (or -2000) mV in acetonitrile using tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte. All voltammograms Table 2 Light absorption properties of ketones 8, 9, and 10 in acetonitrile: maximum absorption wavelengths λ max ; extinction coefficients at λ max (ε max ) and extinction coefficients at the emission wavelength of the LED at 405 nm (ε @405 nm ); oxidation potential (E ox ) and reduction potential (E red ) measured by the results of cyclic voltammetry experiments showed an oxidation wave (no reduction peak could be observed in this range): the oxidation peaks of ketones 8, 9, and 10 (located at 1.14 V, 1.24 V, 1.30 V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE), respectively) correspond to the oxidation of ketone and the subsequent formation of ketone •+ . In contrast, cyclic voltammetry in a potential sweep range from -2000 mV to 0 V (against SCE) indicates that no current in the reduction cycle for ketone 8 (Fig. 6a) can be observed. The reduction peaks of ketones 9 and 10 (located at -1.75 V, -1.69 V, respectively) correspond to the transition from the neutral ketone to its reduced state, ketone •-. This suggests the crucial role of ketones in the FRP process generating radicals to initiate monomer polymerization (see Scheme 3 above). By extracting E ox and E red from the cyclic voltammograms (see Table 2), it is obvious that electron transfer processes in the oxidation process of ketone 8 and whole cyclic processes of ketones 9 and 10 are irreversible reactions. Fluorescence and UV-vis absorption associated experiments in acetonitrile for ketones 8, 9, and 10 were performed (see Fig. 7) to seek the theoretical feasibility of interactions between ketone/Iod and ketone/amine. First, the crossing point of the UV-vis and fluorescence spectra allows the determination of the first singlet excited state energy (E S1 ) for ketones (E S1 = 2.58 eV for ketone 8, 2.66 eV for ketone 9 and 2.71 eV for ketone 10; Table 4). Second, the free energy changes (ΔG Iod or ΔG EDB ) for the electron transfer reactions between (1) ketones as electron donors and Iod as an electron acceptor and (2) amine (Speedcure EDB or TEA) as electron donors and ketones as electron acceptors were calculated from eqn (1) (or eqn (2), respectively) using the oxidation potentials E ox (or E red , respectively) and the excited state energies (E S1 ) of ketones (Table 4).3.2.4.

        <p>As all ketones exhibit good light absorption properties at 405 nm, this parameter alone can hardly explain the difference in polymerization behavior. Therefore, the main difference in the ketone efficiency can probably be ascribed to the reactivity of their excited states with iodonium salt or amine. Ketones in comparison with other photosensitizers presented in previous works (see a review of possible sensitizers/photoinitiators for visible light in ref. 37 and 38) are also able to initiate polymerization under mild conditions. Compared to photoredox catalysts, 37 the new proposed systems do not exhibit significant catalytic activity as the ketone is not fully regenerated (see the photolysis data above). The possibilities for bleaching (r2-r3) mainly govern the consumption of ketones during the photopolymerization process.As all ketones exhibit good light absorption properties at 405 nm, this parameter alone can hardly explain the difference in polymerization behavior.

        <p>In summary, the initiation performance of ketone-based threecomponent systems which contained a new series of ketones, iodonium salt and amine under 405 nm LED irradiation under mild conditions was investigated thoroughly. This new in silico photoinitiator design appears here as a powerful tool for the design of high performance photosensitive resins. The design of the research was based on different chemical and physical properties among ten kinds of ketones, particularly on different optical and electro-properties which can significantly affect the free radical polymerization process of photocurable monomers, such as TMPTA and Ebecryl 40. These results confirmed that the ketones 8, 9, and 10 were evaluated as reliable photoinitiators to promote the polymerization kinetics of monomers, while Speedcure 938 would be a favorable electron-acceptor iodonium salt for the FRP process. Interestingly, ketones 9 and 10 showed well photobleaching properties during photopolymerization processes. Electron transfer from ketones was also studied through cyclic voltammetry experiments. Fluorescence approaches, e.g. fluorescence quenching and lifetime are performed. As a consequence, the generated radicals from the studied photoinitiating systems are confirmed by ESRspin trapping experiments. Then some 3D patterns were fabricated successfully through the 3D printing technique using Ebecryl 40/ketone-based three-component photoinitiating systems. This work is not only potentially effective, safe and environmentally friendly upon specific photoinitiating systems at 405 nm on the photopolymerization kinetics, but also highly attractive for 3D printing based upon LED projectors.In summary, the initiation performance of ketone-based threecomponent systems which contained a new series of ketones, iodonium salt and amine under 405 nm LED irradiation under mild conditions was investigated thoroughly.
