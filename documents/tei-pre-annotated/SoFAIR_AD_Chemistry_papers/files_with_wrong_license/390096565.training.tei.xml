        <p>We report a rotaxane-based information ratchet in which the macrocycle distribution is pumped away from equilibrium using a carbodiimide fuel. A carboxylate group on the axle, non-equidistant between two macrocycle binding sites, efficiently catalyzes the hydration of a carbodiimide fuel to the corresponding urea waste, with &gt;80% of the fuel molecules reacting through the machine-catalyzed pathway. The energy of the reaction is harnessed by kinetic differentiation of the mechanical states of the machine driving the macrocycle to the binding site distal to the catalyst. Steric hindrance between the macrocycle and the fuel slows reaction of the carboxylate group (to form a barrier to macrocycle movement) in the proximal co-conformer, while hydrogen bonding between the macrocycle and the barrier accelerates hydrolysis of the activated ester proximal isomer. The two directionally-biased processes reinforce each other's effect, resulting in a doubly kinetically-gated ratchet that achieves 1:18 directionality, an exceptional degree of selectivity for a synthetic chemically-fueled molecular motor.We report a rotaxane-based information ratchet in which the macrocycle distribution is pumped away from equilibrium using a carbodiimide fuel.

        <p>most prevalent examples feature carbodiimides that react with carboxylates to form O-acyl ureas that can, in turn, be converted to activated species such as anhydrides (dimer formation with a second molecule of carboxylate) [33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43] or esters (Figure 1). [44][45][46][47][48] These unstable products can be formed and hydrolyzed back to the initial carboxylate under the same conditions to complete a catalytic cycle. The carboxylate→Oacyl-urea→anhydride/ester→carboxylate reaction cycle hydrates the carbodiimide fuel to the corresponding urea waste (Figure 1B). Biomolecular motors operate continuously whilst unreacted chemical fuel (generally ATP or GTP) is present and stop once all of the fuel is consumed. 1 However, only one type of autonomous chemically-fueled small-molecule machine has been reported to date: 2 a catenane-based motor that directionally transports a benzylic amide macrocycle around a larger macrocyclic track, together with a closely related rotaxane-based molecular shuttle in which the ring distribution between two axle sites is driven away from equilibrium. Both synthetic examples are fueled by the machine-catalyzed decomposition of Fmoc-Cl. The molecular machines interact with the fuel/waste differently depending on the machines' chemomechanical state, resulting in kinetic asymmetry [3][4][5] that drives directional motion-an information ratchet [6][7][8][9][10][11] mechanism. [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] Within such a cycle the carboxylate moiety initially acts as a nucleophile in its reaction with the carbodiimide, which could potentially serve as a barrier to ring movement in a molecular structure with threaded components (a rotaxane or catenane; Figure 1C). Later in the cycle the derivatized carboxyl-unit acts as an electrophile for hydrolysis, a process which would correspond to barrier removal (Figure 1C). In line with microscopic reversibility, the direct reverse reactions (i.e. waste addition and fuel formation) are also shown in Figure 1C, although these are highly improbable processes. 3 We reasoned that different steric and electronic factors might be brought to bear to independently tune the rates of fuel addition and waste removal depending on the chemomechanical state of the machine. 46,49 We used these principles to design an autonomous carbodiimide-fueled rotaxane information ratchet (Figure 1).most prevalent examples feature carbodiimides that react with carboxylates to form O-acyl ureas that can, in turn, be converted to activated species such as anhydrides (dimer formation with a second molecule of carboxylate) [33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43] or esters (Figure 1).

        <p>Transition state energies (and therefore reaction rates) for fuel addition in all these systems are dependent on the mechanical state of the machine, a feature termed 'kinetic gating'. [12][13][14] Biological machines are doubly-gated, meaning that both fuel addition and waste formation favor forward stepping of the machine. Furthermore, biological machines are very efficient catalysts for the fuel-to-waste process, wasting little fuel in competing background reactions. [15][16][17][18] In contrast, the Fmoc-Cl-driven machines 2 kinetically gate only fuel addition, while the rate of waste formation is independent of the mechanical state of the machine. Furthermore, the Fmoc-Cl fuel suffers from a high background rate of decomposition, with only ~10% of fuel molecules reacting via the machine-catalyzed pathway. It would clearly be advantageous to incorporate the features of double kinetic gating and efficient catalysis, universal in biological information ratchets, into synthetic molecular systems.

        <p>Machine Design. An autonomous information ratchet requires a number of key features. 2,3,5,8,11,[12][13][14] First, there must be kinetic selectivity between forwards and backwards mechanical displacement; this makes the system directional and allows it to perform work. [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Second, the chemical nonequilibrium structure must dissipate under the operation conditions, allowing autonomous repetition that does not undo previous work done by the machine. Third, the machine should provide an alternative pathway for dissipation of the chemical energy in the fuel, which is coupled to the mechanical motion of the machine. Fourth, it is desirable for the machine to display kinetic selectivity for forward over backward displacement during both the barrier addition and barrier removal processes (double kinetic gating). Finally, in order to use the fuel efficiently, the machine should act as an efficacious catalyst for the fuel-to-waste reaction.Machine Design.

        <p>Autonomous Operation. We investigated the dissipative autonomous operation of machine 1 with diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) fuel (Figure 2, see Supporting Information Section S3 for experimental details). The machine could not be operated in DMSO (Figure 2B(i)) because DMSO itself catalyzes carbodiimide hydration. 70 Instead, we dissolved machine 1 (2.5 mM) in pyridine-d5/pyridinium-d5 chloride-buffered (100 mM, pHobs 4.53) MeCN-d3/H2O (9:1 v/v) (Figure 2B(ii)). 71,72 The high concentration of pyridine inhibits N-acyl urea formation. 73 Upon addition of DIC (10 eq., 25 mM), an N-acyl pyridinium barrier to ring movement was observed to form on the machine (1 pyr ), with pyridine from the buffer displacing the O-acyl urea produced initially by the reaction of the rotaxane with the DIC (Figure 2A, B(iii)). 74 We prepared rotaxane 1 (shown as the interconverting proxand dist-coconformers, Figure 1A and2A) in 11-steps from commercially available starting materials (see Supporting Information Section S2.1). The amide-based molecular shuttle [50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63] features two fumaramide sites [64][65][66][67][68][69] (orange/yellow) for binding a benzylic amide macrocycle, located nonequidistant to either side of a catalytic carboxylate group (red). Deuterium labelling at the distal binding site simplifies 1 H NMR analysis of the macrocycle distribution (e.g. Supporting Information, Figure S8). When the macrocycle resides over a particular fumaramide group, a large upfield shift of those protons is apparent in the 1 H NMR spectrum (Figure 2B(i)). 64- 69 Macrocycle shuttling between the fumaramide sites is slow on the NMR time-scale even in solvents as polar as dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6), so the distribution of the macrocycle can be directly observed by 1 H NMR (e.g. Figure 2B(i) and Once all of the DIC fuel had been consumed (12 h), the system was left overnight to dissipate, regenerating starting machine 1. 75 The machine was precipitated from the resulting solution by addition of water, and washed to remove the urea waste and other minor impurities produced from the fueled operation. The machine was then redissolved in either pyridine-d5/pyridinium-d5 chloride-buffered (100 mM, pHobs 4.53) MeCN-d3/H2O (9:1 v/v) (Figure 2B(iv)) or DMSO-d6, resulting in a 1 H NMR spectrum (Figure 2B(v)) virtually indistinguishable from the one obtained prior to the fueled operation.Autonomous Operation.

        <p>Overall, this experiment demonstrates the dissipative formation of the N-acyl pyridinium species 1 pyr (Figure 2B). 76 Significantly, the amount of dist-1 pyr (yellow signals, Figure 2B(iii)) present during fueled operation is ~12× more (determined by 1 H NMR signal integration) than prox-1 pyr (orange signals). However, some anhydride formation 77 (which still ratchets ring displacement; grey peaks, Figure 2B(iii)), means that the dist-1 pyr :prox-1 pyr ratio is not a precise measure of the ratchet directionality, as the coconformers of 1 may form the anhydride barrier at different relative rates to the N-acyl pyridinium barrier. Nonetheless, the observation of a 1:12 ratio in favor of the distal N-acyl pyridinium species (dist-1 pyr ) indicates substantial directional displacement of the macrocycle arising from kinetic asymmetry in the fueling cycle. [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] In a separate experiment we employed an alternative carbodiimide (1-ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide methyl iodide) which showed similar behavior (Figure S10), indicating the generalizability of different carbodiimide fuels for machine operation. Determination of the Mode(s) of Kinetic Gating. We next investigated the steps that cause the ratcheting effect by trapping the macrocycle distribution formed under out-ofequilibrium dissipative fueling at different stages of the fuel cycle (Figure 3). Machine 1 was fueled by DIC in the presence of hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), with p-methoxybenzylamine subsequently added to trap the product mixture through formation of a permanent amide barrier. 43 The HOBt rapidly intercepts the initial, relatively slowly formed, O-acyl urea intermediate to form an activated ester, 1 OBt . p-Methoxybenzylamine converts the activated ester intermediate 1 OBt to amide 2 (Figure 3A, see Supporting Information Section S5.1 for experimental details). Without the addition of the amine to kinetically trap the distribution, activated ester 1 OBt would eventually hydrolyze to restore the initial equilibrium distribution of prox-1 and dist-1 (see Supporting Information, Figure S17 and Figure 2). The barriers in both of the intermediates (O-acyl urea and OBt ester) and the final amide product prevent macrocycle exchange between the fumaramide sites. As the amide forming reaction is very fast, 70,71 the distribution of dist-1 OBt and prox-1 OBt is kinetically trapped as rotaxane prox-2 and dist-2. Rotaxane 2 is stable and can be isolated, removing the urea waste and other minor impurities. The dist-2:prox-2 ratio determined by NMR integration (Figure 3B) is an accurate assessment of the directionality of the autonomous fueled operation of the molecular machine at the time the p-methoxybenzylamine was added.Overall, this experiment demonstrates the dissipative formation of the N-acyl pyridinium species 1 pyr (Figure 2B). 76 Significantly, the amount of dist-1 pyr (yellow signals, Figure 2B(iii)) present during fueled operation is ~12× more (determined by 1 H NMR signal integration) than prox-1 pyr (orange signals).

        <p>consumption of carbodiimide fuel and the generation of urea waste by 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 4A). The concentration of fuel over time was plotted for both the catalyzed and uncatalyzed background reactions (Figure 4B). The reaction profiles can be approximated by pseudo-first order kinetics (Figure 4B, Supporting Information Section S4.2). The results show a &gt;5-fold rate enhancement of fuel consumption in the presence of machine 1, corresponding to ~82% of fuel molecules being used by the machine pathway (Figure 4C, Supporting Information equation S7, S8). Refueling the machine showed no significant degradation in catalytic activity (Supporting Information Section S4.3). While it may be possible to optimize catalysis by this machine-type even further (for example, by changing the pH or water content), more than 4 out of every 5 fuel molecules reacting through the machine-catalyzed pathway already represents a substantial improvement in fuel efficiency over the first autonomous chemically-fueled molecular machines. 2 Upon fueling 1 with DIC in the presence of HOBt and with p-methoxybenzylamine added at time-zero, prox-2 and dist-2 were formed in a ~1:2 ratio (Figure 3B,0 h). This indicates that kinetic gating occurs during fuel addition to the machine; dist-1 reacts with DIC to form a barrier to macrocycle movement ~2× as fast as prox-1.

        <p>We conducted further experiments under identical conditions, but adding the amine at different time points (Figure 3B,C). We observed an increase in the proportion of dist-2 when adding the amine after longer periods of time (Figure 3C). After 5 h, the ratio of prox-2 and dist-2 no longer changed. The changing prox-2:dist-2 ratio fits well to pseudofirst order kinetics, reaching a steady state of ~6% prox-2 and ~94% dist-2, a ratio of ~1:18 (Supporting Information Figure S12). The dramatic increase in directionality arises from additional kinetic gating of the second, waste production, process (see Supporting Information Section S5.2). Water, which hydrolyses the barrier, is a small nucleophile, and thus the steric bulk of the macrocycle at the proximal site does not significantly reduce the rate of barrier removal. Instead, it appears that hydrogen bonding between the macrocycle and the activated ester polarizes the carbonyl, increasing its electrophilicity (Supporting Information Figure S13, S14), resulting in an ~8-fold increase in the rate of barrier hydrolysis of dist-1 OBt compared to prox-1 OBt . Markov Chain analysis 10 shows how this kinetic gating of the barrier removal results in increasing directionality over progressive fueling cycles (Supporting Information, Section S5.3). The experimental data are in good agreement with the kinetic model (Supporting Information, Section S5.4), confirming that the ratchet is doubly kinetically-gated: both barrier formation and barrier removal are kinetically differentiated.We conducted further experiments under identical conditions, but adding the amine at different time points (Figure 3B,C).

        <p>Efficiency of the Fuel-to-Waste Reaction in Driving Machine Operation. Having demonstrated the excellent directionality of this autonomously fueled ratchet, we investigated its efficiency as a catalyst for carbodiimide hydration. It is important that the majority of fuel-to-waste processes occur through the machine-catalyzed pathway, so that fuel is not wasted in a competing background process. [15][16][17][18] The rate of carbodiimide hydration is highly pH and solvent dependent. 78 As rotaxane 1 is a carboxylic acid, the kinetic measurements were performed in a buffered solvent. The rate of hydration of DIC (30 mM) was determined in the presence of machine 1 (10 mM), and compared to the background rate in the absence of 1 (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES)-buffered (100 mM, pHobs 5.68) DMF-d7/D2O (7:3 v/v), see Supporting Information section S4.1 for experimental details).

With an appropriate machine design, both fuel addition and waste production can be kinetically gated as a consequence of component proximity, arising in rotaxane 1 from steric hindrance of the catalytic site during barrier attachment and (probably) hydrogen bonding to activate barrier release via hydrolysis. The two gating processes reinforce each other's effect in the rotaxane, driving the 1:1 prox-:dist-equilibrium ratio to a 1:18 ratio at a dissipatively-maintained steady state. As the carboxylate group is an efficient catalyst for carbodiimide hydration, &gt;80% of fuel molecules react via the machine-catalyzed pathway that allows energy from the fuel-to-waste reaction to be harnessed. The pairing of a carbodiimide fuel with a carboxylate catalyst allows other metastable intermediates such as activated esters to be introduced (Figure 1B), 32,35 providing further significant opportunities in molecular machine design. Varying the nature of the metastable unit may allow fine-tuning of the reaction cycle.
