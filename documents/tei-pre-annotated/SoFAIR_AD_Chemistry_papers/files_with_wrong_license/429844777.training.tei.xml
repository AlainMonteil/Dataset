        <p>Simple nucleophiles, with structural similarities to known hydroboration catalysts, can readily mediate the formation of BH3 and borohydride species from pinacolborane (HBpin). Alkyne and alkene hydroboration reactions were successfully mediated by nucleophiles through BH3 generation, with BH3-catalyzed hydroboration found to dominate catalysis. NMR spectroscopy and kinetic analyses showed that the nucleophiles NaO t Bu, Na[N(SiMe3)2], n Bu2Mg and n BuLi only promoted the formation of BH3 and were not 'true' hydroboration catalysts.</p>
        <p>The need for sustainable catalysis has necessitated the development of a wide range of first-row transition metal and maingroup complexes for catalysis with the hydroboration of carbonyls, imines, alkynes and alkenes with pinacolborane (HBpin) or catecholborane (HBcat) acting as an exemplar reaction. [1][2][3][4] However, the formation of BH3 has been observed in metal-catalyzed hydroborations with HBcat, where hydroboration by BH3 competed with the metal-catalyzed reaction. In rhodium-catalyzed alkene hydroboration reactions with HBcat, the phosphine ligand of the catalyst was found to initiate the decomposition of HBcat to BH3 (Scheme 1A). [5][6][7][8] In other cases, the 'catalysts' were proposed to only mediate the decomposition of HBcat to BH3. [9][10][11][12] BH3 has been used to catalyze the hydroboration of alkynes with HBcat, 13 and alkynes and alkenes with HBpin (Scheme 1B). 14 Whilst the nucleophile-promoted formation of BH3 from HBcat has received significant attention and is routinely controlled for, [6][7][8][9][10][11][12] the formation of BH3 from HBpin is not. The inherent differences in stability of HBcat and HBpin prevents the extrapolation of HBcat decomposition to HBpin and very rarely have control reactions been performed for BH3 when using HBpin. 15 As the majority of new catalytic hydroboration systems contain nucleophilic motifs, it is necessary to exclude nucleophile-promoted BH3 formation from 'true' catalysis by the metal/metalloid species. The nucleophilic motifs can be separated into three classes: pre-catalyst activators, [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22] sacrificial ligands [23][24][25] and inherent nucleophilic catalysts (Scheme 1C). [26][27][28][29][30][31] To distinguish between 'true' catalysis and BH3 catalysis for reactions using HBpin it was necessary to: 1. Identify nucleophile-promoted BH3 formation. 2. Determine if BH3 forms under catalysis conditions. 3. Compare the rate of reaction to that of BH3 catalysis.</p>
        <p>We began by screening nucleophiles with similar motifs to known hydroboration systems to determine their ability to mediate the decomposition of HBpin to BH3 (Table 1). Ti(O i Pr)4 was used by Burgess to question the veracity of the Ti-catalyzed hydroboration of alkenes with HBcat. 11 Reaction of Ti(O i Pr)4 with HBpin gave 0.30 M BH3 as observed by 11 B NMR spectroscopy (Entry 1). Sodium and potassium tert-butoxide have been shown to form BH3 when mixed with HBpin and have been used as activators in hydroboration catalysis. [15][16][17][18] All metal alkoxides gave similar amounts of BH3 formation (Entries 2-4).</p>
        <p>Organolithium and Grignard reagents have been used as precatalyst activators. [19][20] Reaction of MeLi and MeMgBr with HBpin both showed formation of BH3 (Entries 5 and 6). Likewise, NaHBEt3 has been used as an activator and was observed to promote BH3 formation (Entry 7). [21][22] Alkoxides, amides, NaOH, n Bu2Mg, n BuLi and LiAlH4 have all been proposed to be active hydroboration catalysts [26][27][28][29][30][31] or used as sacrificial ligands. [23][24][25] All promoted BH3 formation (Entries 8-13). [BH3] was shown to remain constant after 2 hours by using n BuLi as an exemplar (SI, Table S1). Only NaOTf did not form BH3 (Entry 15). Conditions: Nucleophile (0.12 mmol, 0.50 M), HBpin (1.8 mmol, 7.5 M), SMe2 (0.12 mmol), toluene (0.24 mL), 60 °C, 20 min. Conversion determined by 11 B NMR spectroscopy.</p>
        <p>Whilst an extensive range of nucleophiles reacted with HBpin to give BH3, their ability to form sufficient amounts to catalyze a hydroboration reaction required confirmation. N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) 3 forms air-and moisture stable mono-and bis-adducts with BH3, 32 so would serve as a BH3 indicator; the adducts were observable by 11 B NMR spectroscopy even after work-up. The H3B•SMe2-catalyzed (10 mol%) hydroboration of phenylacetylene 1 gave the alkenylboronic ester 2 in 94% yield (Table 2, Entry 1, left). The addition of TMEDA 3 (10 mol%) significantly inhibited hydroboration (Entry 1, right). The H3B•TMEDA adducts were poor catalysts for the hydroboration at 60 °C, compared to H3B•SMe2 (SI, Table S2). Control experiments showed no interaction between TMEDA 3 and HBpin at 60 °C (see SI). Nine nucleophiles were found to mediate the hydroboration of phenylacetylene 1 with HBpin (Entries 2-10). In all cases TMEDA 3 was found to effectively inhibit alkyne hydroboration and H3B•TMEDA was observed by 11 B NMR spectroscopy in all cases. Conditions: 1 (1.0 mmol), nucleophile (0.10 mmol), HBpin (1.5 mmol). Yields determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopy using an internal standard (1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene). a TMEDA 3 (0.10 mmol). b TMEDA (0.60 mmol). c 18 hours. d TMEDA (0.30 mmol).</p>
        <p>As the hydroboration of alkenes is also catalyzed by BH3 (Table 3, Entry 1), 14 the selected nucleophiles were tested in the hydroboration of tert-butylstyrene 4 with HBpin. Similar results were observed to those using phenylacetylene 1. All nucleophiles efficiently promoted the hydroboration of tert-butylstyrene 4, and hydroboration was inhibited by TMEDA 3 (Entries 2-10). H3B•TMEDA was observed in all cases and, once again, the role of the nucleophile was to promote BH3 formation. prior to the addition of substrate 1 or 4 (then alkyne 1.5 h; alkene 22 h). Yields determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopy using an internal standard (1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 0.10 mmol). a From Table 1. b Et3B (0.09 M) and H3B•SMe2 (0.07 M).</p>
        <p>The addition of TMEDA 3 to the hydroboration reactions clearly indicated that BH3 was formed under reaction conditions. However, TMEDA 3 could also inhibit 'true' catalysis by coordination to the metal or by altering aggregation states. [33][34][35] To distinguish 'true' catalysts from those which only decompose HBpin to BH3, the rates of the BH3-catalyzed hydroborations of alkynes and alkenes (υ0) were plotted against [BH3] loading to generate a calibration gradient (Figure 1A). The rates of the nucleophile-promoted hydroboration reactions were then measured and compared to this (Figure 1B). [BH3]calc was higher than expected for alkenes (Entry 4). Presumably, AlH3 is formed in this case, 36 introducing a complementary, additional, aluminum-catalyzed hydroboration. 26 When n Bu2Mg was tested, [BH3]obs was lower than [BH3]calc (Entry 5) suggesting that n Bu2Mg may be an active catalyst. However, n Bu3B (0.09 M) was also observed by 11 B NMR spectroscopy. The sum of [ n Bu3B]obs and [BH3]obs equaled [BH3]calc. Although trialkylboranes have not been reported to catalyze hydroboration reactions, they are known to redistribute to catalytically active dialkyl-and monoalkylboranes, [37][38] e.g. n Bu2BH and n BuBH2, in the presence of BH3. 39 Hydroboration using Et3B (10 mol%) was successful (Entry 7), presumably through redistribution with HBpin to form R3-nBHn species, albeit at a much lower rate than that using BH3. Using a solution of BH3 and Et3B that mimicked the concentrations of BH3 and n Bu3B formed under catalysis conditions gave an equal rate of reaction to the n Bu2Mg-mediated hydroboration of alkynes (Entry 8). Therefore, n Bu2Mg is not a 'true' catalyst for the hydroboration of alkynes and alkenes but merely a nucleophile.</p>
        <p>[BH3]obs for n BuLi was lower than [BH3]calc and the hydroboration of alkynes had a higher [BH3]calc compared to alkenes (Entry 6). Again, this suggested that n BuLi was an active catalyst. [BH 3 ] (M) in the reaction of n BuLi with HBpin. Furthermore, LiBH4 was observed by 11 B and 7 Li NMR spectroscopy and was the only lithium species present, inferring that the hydroboration reactions were not catalyzed by n BuLi. n BuH2B•SMe2 was also observed by 11 B NMR spectroscopy, suggesting that n Bu2BH and n BuBH2 were formed, along with n Bu3B. The difference between [BH3]calc for alkynes and alkenes is presumably due to the different rates of hydroboration using mono-and dialkylboranes, and BH3 (Entries 1 and 9). 40 Borane-catalyzed hydroboration is proposed to proceed by an initial hydroboration to give an alkenyl-or alkylborane intermediate which undergoes transborylation 38,41 with HBpin to give the boronic ester product and regenerate the borane catalyst (Scheme 2).</p>
        <p>Ketone hydroboration is often used as a basis to test new catalyst structures. [2][3][4] However, Clark showed that ketone hydroboration with HBpin was mediated by NaO t Bu. 17 Nucleophilic addition of NaO t Bu to HBpin gave a trialkoxyborohydride, which is known to reduce ketones. 42 Borohydride addition to a ketone formally gives an alkoxide, which reacts with HBpin to form another trialkoxyborohydride, propagating the reaction. To confirm Clark's mechanism, and show its applicability to other nucleophiles, the hydroboration of acetophenone 6 was investigated. Whilst BH3 would successfully mediate the hydroboration of acetophenone 6, the yield was much lower than any of the nucleophile-mediated reactions (SI, Table S4). Therefore, nucleophile-mediated ketone hydroboration does not proceed by BH3 catalysis. In the nucleophile-promoted decomposition reactions, borohydride species were observed in addition to BH3. Nucleophile-promoted decomposition of HBpin must proceed by the initial formation of a hydridic boron 'ate' species, from nucleophilic addition to HBpin (e.g. [NuHBpin] -). Trialkoxyborohydride 8 (the product of hydride transfer to acetophenone) was prepared and shown to be an active catalyst for the hydroboration of acetophenone 6 (Scheme 3). This supports Clark's mechanism and demonstrates this mechanism is applicable to the other nucleophiles studied. It is possible that this mechanism is operative in the hydroboration of other carbonyl derivatives.</p>
        <p>Conditions: 6 (1.0 mmol), 8 (0.20 M in THF, 0.040 mmol), HBpin (1.5 mmol). Yield determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopy using an internal standard (1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 0.10 mmol).</p>
        <p>The hydroboration of alkynes, alkenes and ketones with HBpin can be effectively mediated by simple nucleophiles. The results suggest that the reactions proceed through nucleophile-promoted decomposition of HBpin. BH3 and borohydride species are formed by decomposition and these are active catalysts for the hydroboration of alkynes and alkenes, and ketones, respectively. For carbanion-containing systems, the decomposition is more complex, forming multiple borane species, all of which are potentially active hydroboration catalysts. Any future hydroboration catalysts should be rigorously tested to confirm that the decomposition of HBpin does not occur, particularly nonenantioselective catalysts and those that exhibit the same regioselectivity as BH3-catalyzed hydroboration or borohydride reduction. The addition of TMEDA and 11 B NMR spectroscopy both offer means of observing R3B (R = H, alkyl or alkenyl) in catalyzed hydroboration reactions. However, it should be noted that, even in BH3-catalyzed reactions, observation of these intermediates may be challenging as transborylation from R3B to RBpin is fast and results in very low R3B concentrations.</p>
