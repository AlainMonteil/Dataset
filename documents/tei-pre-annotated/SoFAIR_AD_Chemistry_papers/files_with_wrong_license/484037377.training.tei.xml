        <p>In recent years, exciting developments have taken place in the identification of the role of cosmic rays in star-forming environments. Observations from radio to infrared wavelengths and theoretical modelling have shown that lowenergy cosmic rays (&lt; 1 TeV) play a fundamental role in shaping the chemical richness of the interstellar medium, determining the dynamical evolution of molecular clouds.

        <p>Thanks to increasingly powerful observing facilities and sophisticated theoretical models, we are now able to address quantitatively several key aspects in process of star formation in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, such as the formation of protostellar discs and bipolar jets in collapsing molecular clouds, the coalescence of dust grains and the formation of planetesimals and planets, and the origin of chemical complexity from molecular cloud to comets and planets. A field where results have been particularly exciting in recent years is the study of the interaction of cosmic rays (CRs) with the interstellar matter. For star formation to take place, gas and dust must be sufficiently cold such that gravity overcomes the thermal pressure and the ionisation fraction must be sufficiently low to allow significant decoupling of the gas from the Galactic magnetic field. As soon as the visual extinction is of the order of 3-4 magnitudes, the UV photon flux of the interstellar radiation field is completely attenuated, thus the only source of ionisation and heating is represented by low-energy CRs1 . Since the cross sections of the most relevant processes for star formation peak at relatively low energies (e.g., ∼ 10 eV for dissociation of H 2 by electrons and ∼ 10 keV for ionisation of H 2 by protons), low-energy CRs turn out to be a fundamental ingredient for the dynamical and chemical evolution of star-forming regions on a wide range of physical scales. On the largest global scale of star formation, CRs can contribute a significant amount of pressure to the Galaxy influencing Galactic dynamics.Thanks to increasingly powerful observing facilities and sophisticated theoretical models, we are now able to address quantitatively several key aspects in process of star formation in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, such as the formation of protostellar discs and bipolar jets in collapsing molecular clouds, the coalescence of dust grains and the formation of planetesimals and planets, and the origin of chemical complexity from molecular cloud to comets and planets.

        <p>The two main components of low-energy CRs ( 1 TeV) considered in this review are those accelerated and confined in the Galactic disk (producing what is known as the Galactic CR spectrum), and in shocks associated to the star formation process itself (hereafter local CRs). The majority of low-energy CRs contributing to the observed Galactic spectrum are likely to originate from sources within our Galaxy, such as supernova remnants (Baade and Zwicky, 1934;Blasi, 2013) and colliding stellar winds (Casse and Paul, 1980;Aharonian et al., 2019). Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA, also known as first-order Fermi acceleration) and magnetic reconnection are some of the possible acceleration mechanisms (see e.g. reviews by Bell, 2013;de Gouveia Dal Pino and Kowal, 2015). The local spectrum of Galactic CRs has been measured by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts in the interstellar medium (ISM; Cummings et al., 2016;Stone et al., 2019), and is thought to be unmodulated by the solar wind. The observed Galactic CR proton spectrum has a slope of -2.78 (see e.g. Vos and Potgieter, 2015), steeper than expected from DSA which would result in a slope of -2. This may simply reflect the fact that the proton spectrum from the source has been modulated by some physical process en route to us, such as diffusive steepening, or a different acceleration mechanism. The Galactic CR spectrum may be specific to our location within the Galaxy and varies spatially (see Sect. 2). It will certainly vary close to individual sources of CRs, for instance, and will be different in other galaxies (see Sect. 7.5).The two main components of low-energy CRs ( 1 TeV) considered in this review are those accelerated and confined in the Galactic disk (producing what is known as the Galactic CR spectrum), and in shocks associated to the star formation process itself (hereafter local CRs).

        <p>In the context of star formation, there has been much interest in recent years in locally accelerated sources of low-energy CRs which will be discussed in some detail in this review. Even if these locally accelerated low-energy CRs do not contribute significantly to the Galactic CR spectrum, they represent the key to explain the high ionisation rate and the synchrotron emission observed in protostellar environments. The main accelerators are thought to be protostellar shocks. More precisely, local CRs are accelerated at the surface of the shocks located along the bipolar jets and on the protostellar surface, where the accretion disc matter channelled by magnetic fields hits the protostellar surface itself.In the context of star formation, there has been much interest in recent years in locally accelerated sources of low-energy CRs which will be discussed in some detail in this review.

        <p>This review is organised as follows: we focus on the direct measurements and the different observational methods to constrain the CR flux (Sect. 2); we summarise the mechanisms of interaction of CRs with the interstellar medium, providing accurate details on the regimes of CR transport and the energy loss processes (Sect. 3); we examine in depth the role of CRs at cloud (Sect. 4) and circumstellar disc (Sect. 5) scales; we describe how CRs can be efficiently accelerated in protostellar environments (Sect. 6); we discuss the implications of presence of CRs at different Galactic scales (Sect. 7); finally in Sect. 8 we summarise the most important findings, concluding with an outlook on future work.This review is organised as follows: we focus on the direct measurements and the different observational methods to constrain the CR flux (Sect. 2); we summarise the mechanisms of interaction of CRs with the interstellar medium, providing accurate details on the regimes of CR transport and the energy loss processes (Sect. 3); we examine in depth the role of CRs at cloud (Sect. 4) and circumstellar disc (Sect. 5) scales; we describe how CRs can be efficiently accelerated in protostellar environments (Sect. 6); we discuss the implications of presence of CRs at different Galactic scales (Sect. 7); finally in Sect. 8 we summarise the most important findings, concluding with an outlook on future work.</p>
        <p>CRs are unlike radiation in that they do not travel directly to the Earth from their points of origin, instead diffusing through the Galaxy due to interactions with magnetic fields. As such, observations of CRs do not represent particles accelerated in any one particular object or region. Rather, these observations represent the population of particles accelerated throughout the Galaxy that happen now to be traversing our neighborhood. In order to investigate the CR spectrum elsewhere we must rely on observables produced by the various energy loss mechanisms described in Sect. 3. Here, we briefly discuss the direct measurement of CRs made in the solar system and local ISM and next consider different observables attributed to CR interactions and how they constrain aspects of the CR spectrum.CRs are unlike radiation in that they do not travel directly to the Earth from their points of origin, instead diffusing through the Galaxy due to interactions with magnetic fields.

        <p>As CRs diffuse throughout the Galaxy, some will inevitably pass through our solar system, where they can be measured by instruments aboard satellites in Earthorbit and balloons flown at high altitude. Several experiments have been designed for observing CRs in different energy ranges (for a recent summary, see Table 1 in Grenier et al., 2015), and only by combining the observations from each is the full CR spectrum revealed. While CRs with energies above a few GeV can reach these experiments relatively unhindered, lower-energy particles are deflected from the inner solar system by the magnetic field coupled to the solar wind, an effect referred to as modulation. Direct measurement of the unmodulated CR spectrum below a few GeV requires an instrument that is outside the heliosphere, a condition now satisfied by the Cosmic Ray Subsystem instruments on both Voyager spacecrafts. The best measurements of the local interstellar CR proton and electron spectra down to energies of about 3 MeV are currently provided by observations from Voyager 1 (Cummings et al., 2016) and Voyager 2 (Stone et al., 2019).As CRs diffuse throughout the Galaxy, some will inevitably pass through our solar system, where they can be measured by instruments aboard satellites in Earthorbit and balloons flown at high altitude.

        <p>Ionisation of H and H 2 are the dominant energy loss mechanisms for low-energy CRs protons. While the resulting H + and H + 2 are not directly observable, these ions react with other gas phase species in the ISM, initiating a network of ionmolecule reactions that drive interstellar chemistry. In diffuse molecular clouds the abundances of H + 3 , OH + , and H 2 O + depend strongly on the CR flux, and observations of these molecules are used to constrain the CR ionisation rate, ζ. Note that there are multiple definitions of the CR ionisation rate, including the primary ionisation rate of H (ζ prim ; ionisation rate of atomic hydrogen due only to CR nuclei), the total ionisation rate of H (ζ H ; ionisation rate of atomic hydrogen due to both CR nuclei and secondary electrons produced by the primary ionisation events), and the total ionisation rate of H 2 (ζ 2 ; ionisation rate of molecular hydrogen due to both CR nuclei and secondary electrons produced by the primary ionisation events). The exact relationship between these different ionisation rates depends on gas composition, but ζ H ≈ 1.5ζ prim and ζ H 2 ≈ 2.3ζ prim are reasonable approximations (Glassgold and Langer, 1974). Here, we will use ζ prim when quoting results from various studies for the sake of consistency. Surveys of H + 3 , OH + , and H 2 O + absorption have now been used to place constraints on the CR ionisation rate in about 200 different diffuse cloud components within the Galactic disc (Indriolo et al., 2007;Indriolo and McCall, 2012;Porras et al., 2014;Indriolo et al., 2015;Zhao et al., 2015;Bacalla et al., 2019). Figure 1 shows the distribution of primary CR ionisation rates inferred from these observations. Results from the different surveys are consistent with each other within uncertainties, finding a mean ionisation rate of ζ prim = (1.8 +3.1 -1.1 ) × 10 -16 s -1 . The wide range of ionisation rates inferred from molecular abundances implies that the underlying CR spectrum is not uniform throughout the Galactic disc. These variations can be caused either by scaling the entire spectrum up or down in flux or by adding a varying component at low energies while maintaining the same underlying floor spectrum everywhere. An ionisation rate can also be calculated using the particle spectra measured by Voyager spacecrafts to determine how the particle flux in the local ISM compares to that elsewhere. Doing so results in a value of ζ prim ∼ 10 -17 s -1 , over a factor of 10 times lower than the average value in diffuse molecular clouds (Cummings et al., 2016), suggesting that the local CR flux may not be representative of the Galaxy as a whole. However, there are some upper limits on ionisation rates inferred from non-detections of H + 3 and OH + thatIonisation of H and H 2 are the dominant energy loss mechanisms for low-energy CRs protons.

        <p>For CR protons with E 1 GeV energy losses due to pion production dominate those due to ionisation. The production of π 0 particles via elastic collisions with ambient atoms, and subsequent rapid decay into a pair of γ-ray photons, provides a potential observable. Indeed, this pionic γ-ray emission has been detected from supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds (e.g. Ackermann et al., 2013), from the gas within the Galactic plane (Ackermann et al., 2012), and even from nearby molecular clouds (e.g., Yang et al., 2014;Neronov et al., 2017). The γ-ray emission spectrum resulting from π 0 produced by CRs depends on the spectrum of CR particles and on the distribution of target ambient atoms. The total column density of ambient material along a given line-of-sight can be constrained by observations of H, CO and dust, and this can be used in concert with the observed γ-ray spectrum to infer the underlying CR spectrum at energies above about 1 GeV. γ-ray observations of several nearby molecular clouds with Fermi-LAT suggest a CR spectrum that is consistent with that measured in the local ISM (Neronov et al., 2017), at least for the sampled energy range.For CR protons with E 1 GeV energy losses due to pion production dominate those due to ionisation.

        <p>The ionisation of atoms is not limited to the removal of an electron from any specific energy level. When an electron is removed from an inner shell, the vacancy in that shell will rapidly be filled by the de-excitation of an electron from a more energetic shell, a process that generates a photon. A vacancy in the n = 1 level is most often filled by an electron from the n = 2 level. Emission arising from the n = 2 → 1 transition is referred to as Kα and typically occurs in the X-ray regime. The Fe Kα line at 6.4 keV has been observed in the Galactic centre and from molecular clouds near supernova remnants, but different studies of these regions have interpreted the emission as the product of ionisation by electrons (Yusef-Zadeh et al., 2007), low-energy protons (Tatischeff et al., 2012;Nobukawa et al., 2018) and X-ray photons (Ponti et al., 2010). While Fe Kα line emission indicates that energetic particles or photons are present, it can be difficult to distinguish which is the dominant ionising mechanism. As such, placing constraints on the underlying CR spectrum from Fe Kα emission is highly uncertain.The ionisation of atoms is not limited to the removal of an electron from any specific energy level.

        <p>The exact level of ionisation within protoplanetary discs has far-reaching consequences. In this section we discuss observational efforts to constrain the ionisation rate at disc scales. In principle, the presence of CRs can be inferred from the products of interactions, including high-energy photons. However, stellar or Galactic CRs that interact with protoplanetary discs will not result in an observable level of γ rays, since the latter would likely be absorbed by the disc. Instead, very sensitive observations carried out by the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) can measure the ratio of different molecules that directly constrain the (total) ionisation rate (Cleeves et al., 2015, for instance). Chemical models can also indirectly constrain the ionisation rate from CO observations (such as Schwarz et al., 2018). Cleeves et al. (2015), using observations from the Submillimeter Array of HCO + and ALMA observations of N 2 H + , constrained the total ionisation rate (i.e., from all sources of ionisation including FUV, X-rays, CRs etc.) for TW Hya's disc to be ζ H 2 10 -19 s -1 , which is relatively low. TW Hya is a prime observational target due to its close proximity. However, it is a relatively old disc and the total disc mass of 0.02M derived from dust observations (assuming a particular dust to gas mass ratio) is quite large in comparison to the scatter observed in young star-forming regions (Pascucci et al., 2016). Thus, the observed low ionisation rate in TW Hya's disc may not be representative of most discs in star-forming regions. On the other hand Schwarz et al. (2018) present results from CO chemical models for a relatively large sample of observed protoplanetary discs and conclude an unknown physical process must be operating in these discs.

        <p>More direct observations are needed to constrain the ionisation rate in a bigger sample of protoplanetary discs. Modelling the influence of SCRs in a wide range of discs is critical to identify discs likely to display high ionisation rates. Such observations will in turn constrain some of the free parameters adopted in propagation models. Using the empirical relationship between the X-ray and SCR luminosity obtained through combined (sub-)millimetre and X-ray observations will also help to constrain the X-ray contribution to the ionisation rate and the luminosity of SCRs appropriate to model specific discs.More direct observations are needed to constrain the ionisation rate in a bigger sample of protoplanetary discs.

        <p>In this section we focus on the interaction of Galactic CRs with dense astrophysical objects, such as molecular clouds, cores, and discs, and describe approaches to calculate the CR penetration into these objects and the resulting ionisation/heating. In the ISM the details of CR transport are governed by the dominant role of their interaction with gas. The energy losses are proportional to the gas density and, hence, the adiabatic losses, which play an important role on Galactic scales, can be completely neglected. Consequently, one can also neglect CR diffusion in momentum space, leading to CR re-acceleration in the Galaxy. These processes will be discussed in Sect. 7.2.In this section we focus on the interaction of Galactic CRs with dense astrophysical objects, such as molecular clouds, cores, and discs, and describe approaches to calculate the CR penetration into these objects and the resulting ionisation/heating.

        <p>The gyroradii of low-energy CRs, whose energy is relevant for ionisation and heating in molecular clouds and discs, are much smaller than the spatial scales characterising inhomogeneities in the magnetic field and gas density within these objects. Thus, we adopt the concept of the guiding centre for CRs and consider their propagation along the local magnetic field, with coordinate s measured along the field line. We introduce the effective column density of gas traversed by a CR particle before it reaches a given point (Padovani et al., 2018b),The gyroradii of low-energy CRs, whose energy is relevant for ionisation and heating in molecular clouds and discs, are much smaller than the spatial scales characterising inhomogeneities in the magnetic field and gas density within these objects.

This has clear implications for gas chemistry and angular momentum transport, which are important ingredients in the star-formation process.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we point out that the above analysis applies to the free-streaming regime of CR propagation. In the presence of weak, small-scale MHD turbulence, resonant pitch-angle scattering can lead to the efficient isotropisation of the distribution function, completely eliminating the effect of magnetic pockets. In this diffusive regime the results presented in Sect. 3.1.2 are applicable for any magnetic configuration, irrespective of the behavior of B(s). Note, however, that very strong turbulence may further increase mirroring, and thus reduce the overall density of CRs in cores (Fatuzzo and Adams, 2014).In conclusion, we point out that the above analysis applies to the free-streaming regime of CR propagation.

        <p>It has long been known (see Lerche, 1967;Kulsrud and Pearce, 1969) that a CR flux propagating through a plasma can excite MHD waves and thus create magnetic disturbances. However, the effect of these disturbances on the penetration of CRs into molecular clouds and on the resulting ionisation is still debated (Skilling and Strong, 1976;Cesarsky and Völk, 1978;Morlino and Gabici, 2015;Ivlev et al., 2018;Phan et al., 2018;Dogiel et al., 2018). Skilling and Strong (1976) predicted from a qualitative analysis of the problem a depletion of CR density inside the clouds. They concluded that Alfvén waves should be generated by streaming CRs in the cloud envelopes where the gas density is low enough to sustain the waves, which suppresses penetration by sub-GeV CRs. This statement was confirmed by analytical and numerical calculations carried out by Ivlev et al. (2018). It was also shown that the flux penetrating into very dense clouds (where CRs are fully absorbed) has a universal energy dependence -it is exclusively determined by the densities of ionised and neutral components of the cloud envelopes. Furthermore, Ivlev et al. (2018) and Dogiel et al. (2018) demonstrated that the turbulence leading to the universal flux can be generated either by CR absorption in the vicinity of a dense cloud or by CR energy losses in the outer part of the envelope. In both cases, turbulence makes the spectrum of low-energy CRs harder and independent from that in the ISM.It has long been known (see Lerche, 1967;Kulsrud and Pearce, 1969) that a CR flux propagating through a plasma can excite MHD waves and thus create magnetic disturbances.

        <p>The CR ionisation rate depends on both the propagation model for CRs and on their spectrum at the edge of the cloud. Ionisation at column densities in the range of N = 10 20 -10 23 cm -2 is dominated by CR protons with energies from 1 MeV to 1 GeV. Unfortunately, the spectrum of such particles cannot be measured accurately from near Earth because they are largely excluded by the solar wind (Potgieter, 2013). The Voyager probes have measured the spectrum of Galactic CRs down to 3 MeV (Cummings et al., 2016;Stone et al., 2019). However, the magnetic field direction measured by the probes has not changed, as would be expected if they were beyond the influence of solar modulation (Gloeckler and Fisk, 2015). Furthermore, Padovani et al. (2018b) and Phan et al. (2018) noted that the proton and electron spectra from Voyager spacecrafts were too low by about a factor of 10 to explain the values of the ionisation rate observed in nearby molecular clouds.

        <p>In this section we discuss the possible effect of preexisting MHD turbulence on CR ionisation (Sect. 3.1.2) and compare the results with predictions derived from the free-streaming approximation (Sect. 3.1.1). Molecular cloud envelopes are thought to be turbulent. However, it is not known whether magnetic disturbances associated with the turbulence would have sufficient energy at small enough scales to ensure diffusive transport for the CRs responsible for the majority of the ionisation. Radio scintillation observations (e.g., Armstrong et al., 1995) suggest that ISM turbulence extends to scales at least as small as 10 10 cm, less than the gyroradius of a 100 KeV proton, but it is still not clear that this result is relevant for molecular clouds.In this section we discuss the possible effect of preexisting MHD turbulence on CR ionisation (Sect. 3.1.2) and compare the results with predictions derived from the free-streaming approximation (Sect. 3.1.1).

        <p>As pointed out in Sect. 3.1.2, the value of n H D 0 does not depend on N for a constant ionisation fraction and is determined by the velocity exponent λ of the turbu-lent spectrum. Silsbee and Ivlev (2019) showed that condition (51) is expected to hold for N 8×10 19 cm -2 for a Kolmogorov spectrum and for N 3×10 18 cm -2 for a Kraichnan spectrum. At higher column densities, the ion density is expected to drop dramatically when there are insufficient UV photons to keep carbon ionised. This depends on the strength of the UV field near the cloud, as well as on the assumed properties of the medium (Hollenbach and Tielens, 1999). Based on the work of Keto and Caselli (2008), we assume the transition to take place at N tran ∼ 2 × 10 21 cm -2 , though we note that Neufeld and Wolfire (2017) find a very sharp decline in C + abundance near a column density of 6×10 20 cm -2 . For N N tran , the ion density is expected to drop by a factor of ∼ 100, depending on the value of ζ H 2 (Neufeld and Wolfire, 2017), leading to a proportional increase in D 0 . It appears unlikely that the turbulence would then be strong enough to greatly influence CR propagation. In environments with larger CR fluxes or/and UV radiation, this boundary may move to higher column density. Specifically, Neufeld and Wolfire (2017) find that if ζ H 2 /n H &gt; 1.2 × 10 -17 cm 3 s -1 , then the ionisation fraction remains greater than 10 -4 to N ∼ 10 22 cm -2 .

We also point out that the slope for ζ H 2 (N ) obtained from Neufeld and Wolfire (2017) (1.05 ± 0.36) is fit better by the diffusive model with δ = -1.2, which appears to favor this model. However, as illustrated by the magnitude of the error bars, the slope suggested by Neufeld and Wolfire (2017) is rather uncertain.</p>
        <p>Thus, if a certain degree of preexisting turbulence is present in a cloud, CRs propagate diffusively. A substantially steeper ionisation rate slope as a function of the effective column density is predicted in this case compared with the freestreaming model. Under conditions appropriate for local molecular clouds, this mechanism would likely only operate up to column densities of ∼ 10 21 cm -2 . However, the assumption of diffusive propagation makes a significant difference to the behavior of ζ H 2 (N ). Equations ( 12) and ( 21) provide convenient analytic solutions for ζ H 2 (N ) in the two regimes, applicable for a variety of environments.Thus, if a certain degree of preexisting turbulence is present in a cloud, CRs propagate diffusively.

        <p>Astrochemistry calculations of molecular clouds have typically neglected CR attenuation and instead adopt a constant CR ionisation rate throughout the cloud (Glover and Clark, 2012;Offner et al., 2013;Bisbas et al., 2017). However, the net result of the CR processes described above is that -even in the absence of local, internal CR sources (see Sect. 6) -molecular clouds likely experience a spatially varying ionisation rate, which in turn impacts gas chemistry and temperature (Gaches et al., 2019a). The inner, high-extinction regions of molecular clouds are well-shielded from interstellar X-ray and FUV photons, allowing the gas to cool and carbon and nitrogen species to freeze onto dust grains. Due to the cold (∼10 K) conditions typical of starless cores, once species stick to grain surfaces, they cannot thermally evaporate (Caselli and Ceccarelli, 2012). However, CRs can regulate the gas phase abundances of molecules in these regions via non-thermal desorption caused by CRs hitting dust grains or photodesorption due to the FUV photons produced by CR interactions with H 2 ( Öberg et al., 2009c,b). At moderate fluxes, these CR processes also promote the formation of organic species in dense regions, such as H 2 CO, CH 3 OH and HCOOCH 3 (Bennett and Kaiser, 2007;Öberg et al., 2009a, 2010).Astrochemistry calculations of molecular clouds have typically neglected CR attenuation and instead adopt a constant CR ionisation rate throughout the cloud (Glover and Clark, 2012;Offner et al., 2013;Bisbas et al., 2017).

        <p>Molecular clouds in environments experiencing high CR fluxes, such as within the CMZ or starburst galaxies, may have significantly altered carbon chemistry. The effects of high CR ionisation rates on CO is particularly important for observations of molecular clouds, since the CO emission to H 2 gas mass ratio, or X CO , is ubiquitously used to study molecular clouds and infer their masses (Bolatto et al., 2013). However, chemical models demonstrate that clouds in environments with 10 times the typical Galactic CR ionisation rate exhibit significantly reduced CO/H 2 ratios (Bisbas et al., 2017;Gaches et al., 2019b). The fraction of atomic and ionised carbon rises steadily for CR ionisation rates 10 2 -10 3 times the Galactic mean value, and eventually C + becomes the dominant gas tracer (Bisbas et al., 2017).Molecular clouds in environments experiencing high CR fluxes, such as within the CMZ or starburst galaxies, may have significantly altered carbon chemistry.

        <p>The CR flux and its impact on gas chemistry also shape the cloud temperature. CR heating, produced by the energetic and excited products of CR interactions, can be an important heating source in regions with high CR fluxes, since nearly half of the CR energy goes into this heating mechanism (Glassgold et al., 2012). Clouds with significant CR ionisation are also correspondingly warmer (Bisbas et al., 2017;Gaches and Offner, 2018). The CR pressure is dynamically negligible (Gaches and Offner, 2018); however, the resulting elevated temperatures of 30 -50 K increase the thermal pressure, which in turn may make it more difficult to form stars.

        <p>The fractional abundance of hydrogen atoms, f H , measured in the densest regions of molecular clouds can only be explained by the dissociation of H 2 by CRs. Recently, Padovani et al. (2018a) carried our detailed studies of how CRs control the value of f H in dark clouds. They showed that the CR dissociation rate is primarily determined by secondary electrons produced during the primary CR ionisation process. These secondary electrons represent the only source of atomic hydrogen at column densities above 10 21 cm -2 . Furthermore, they found that the ratio of H 2 dissociation and ionisation rates remains practically constant and equal to ∼ 0.7 in a broad range of column densities between ∼ 10 21 cm -2 and ∼ 10 25 cm -2 , irrespective of the form of the interstellar CR spectrum. Finally, it was pointed out that only a CR proton spectrum enhanced at low energies (spectrum H , see Eq.

        <p>Interstellar dust grains in dense molecular clouds are subject to several electric charging processes (e.g., Draine and Sutin, 1987;Weingartner and Draine, 2001). The resulting net charge carried by micron or sub-micron grains has important consequences for the chemical and dynamical evolution of molecular clouds: it affects the process of dust coagulation (Okuzumi, 2009), the rate of graincatalysed electron-ion recombination (Mestel and Spitzer, 1956), the amount of gas-phase elemental depletion (Spitzer, 1941), and the electrical resistivity of the gas (Elmegreen, 1979). Collection of electrons and ions from the surrounding gas and photoemission induced by the interstellar UV field had been usually assumed to be the dominant grain charging mechanisms in the cold ISM (e.g., Draine and Sutin, 1987;Draine, 2011;Weingartner and Draine, 2001). Ivlev et al. (2015) showed that CRs strongly affect charging of dust grains in cold dense molecular clouds. They investigated two additional mechanisms of dust charging: collection of suprathermal CR electrons and protons by grains, and photoelectric emission from grains due H 2 fluorescence generated by CRs in the Lyman and Werner bands (Prasad and Tarafdar, 1983;Cecchi-Pestellini and Aiello, 1992). While the former mechanism turns out to always be negligible, the CR-induced photoemission was shown to dramatically modify the charge distribution for submicron grains for column densities of up to ∼ 3 × 10 22 cm -2 . The competition between the collection of electrons and ions, which primarily produce singly charged negative grains, and the CR-induced photoemission, which results in positive charging, significantly broadens the charge distribution.Interstellar dust grains in dense molecular clouds are subject to several electric charging processes (e.g., Draine and Sutin, 1987;Weingartner and Draine, 2001).

        <p>The ionisation rate critically shapes protoplanetary disc properties from beginning to end, influencing disc/planet formation, evolution and lifetimes. Protoplanetary discs are dense and relatively cold making any potential source of ionisation very important. The degree of ionisation in the collapsing core affects the gas-field coupling and thus formation time and extent of the initial disc (Padovani et al., 2014). Throughout the disc lifetime, ionisation dictates disc chemistry and thereby regulates the efficiency of angular momentum transport via the magneto-rotational instability (MRI, Balbus and Hawley, 1991;Gammie, 1996). Magneto-centrifugally launched winds (Blandford and Payne, 1982) may also play a role in removing angular momentum from discs, thus allowing mass accretion onto the central star. These winds can also only be efficient if sufficient ionisation exists below the disc surface layers. Meanwhile, reduced ionisation near the disc midplane enables planetesimal formation to commence (Gressel et al., 2012).The ionisation rate critically shapes protoplanetary disc properties from beginning to end, influencing disc/planet formation, evolution and lifetimes.

        <p>A comprehensive model of ionisation at high densities, relevant for the inner regions of collapsing clouds and circumstellar discs, has been recently developed by Padovani et al. (2018b). The choice of the proper transport regime of CR protons (see Sect. 3.3) as well as of accurate models for the generation and transport of secondary CRs (see Sect. 3.4) is crucial for computing ionisation in these environments. The authors calculated dependencies for ζ H 2 (N ), representing several characteristic energy spectra of CRs. Apart from an extreme (and also poorly constrained) case of ionisation due to enhanced flux of stellar protons, the obtained dependencies can be considered fairly universal and applicable to any relevant environment. The principal limitation of these results is that they cannot be generally used to describe ionisation in regions dominated by MHD turbulence, which may lead to diffusive CR transport (see Sect. 3.1.2). Padovani et al. (2018b) adopted an analytical expression for the interstellar spectra of CR electrons and protons, described by Eq. ( 52) (spectra of heavier nuclei, with the corresponding abundances, are described by the same energy dependence). By summing the contributions due to primary CRs (protons, heavier nuclei, and electrons) and secondary CR species (electron-positron pairs and photons), one can derive the total production rate of molecular hydrogen ions, H + 2 . Figure 9 presents the total ionisation rate and partial contributions from various species. For convenience, ζ H 2 is plotted versus both the column density, N , and the surface density, Σ; numerically, the relation between N [cm -2 ] and Σ [g cm -2 ] is given by N = 2.55 × 10 23 Σ, which corresponds to an ISM elemental abundance with mean molecular weight of 2.35.A comprehensive model of ionisation at high densities, relevant for the inner regions of collapsing clouds and circumstellar discs, has been recently developed by Padovani et al.

        <p>Figure 9 shows that for Σ below the transition surface density, Σ tr ∼ 130 g cm -2 , ionisation is mainly due to CR protons (and their secondary electrons), while at higher surface densities the contribution of electron-positron pairs produced by photon decay becomes progressively dominant. At Σ 600 g cm -2 , pairs fully determine the ionisation -their contribution is about a factor of 10 larger than that of CR protons. Hence, for Σ Σ tr the relevant quantity is the effective surface density seen by CRs moving along magnetic field lines; depending on the magnetic field configuration (see, e.g., Padovani et al., 2013), the latter is generally larger or much larger than the line-of-sight surface density. Otherwise, if Σ Σ tr , the ionisation is no longer affected by the magnetic field and therefore is controlled by the line of sight, rather than the effective column density.Figure 9 shows that for Σ below the transition surface density, Σ tr ∼ 130 g cm -2 , ionisation is mainly due to CR protons (and their secondary electrons), while at higher surface densities the contribution of electron-positron pairs produced by photon decay becomes progressively dominant.

Unfortunately, little can be said about the extent and shape of this region of CR exclusion other than scaling up the properties of the Sun's heliosphere. Cleeves et al. (2013) suggested that the T-Tauriosphere may well surround the entire disc. However, the energies of CR particles mostly responsible for the ionisation at column densities above ∼ 100 g cm -2 exceed a few GeV. The effect of the modulation by the stellar wind at these energies is uncertain. For T-Tauri (TT) stars, Cleeves et al. (2013) estimated values for the modulation potential, φ, at a distance of 1 AU in the range φ = 4.8 -18 GeV, leading to a reduction of the CR flux at E = 10 GeV by a factor of ∼ 6 and 100, respectively (φ is an unknown function of distance, which could be determined from detailed magnetospheric models). On the other hand, the presence of a young magnetically active star may lead to increased production of SCRs (see Sect. 6.3). Padovani et al. (2018b) applied their model of CR propagation to estimate the ionisation produced at a distance of 1 AU from the protostar by two different input proton spectra: a spectrum of Galactic protons modulated by TT stellar winds (Usoskin et al., 2005;Cleeves et al., 2013) and an enhanced flux of stellar protons generated by flares in an active TT star (Feigelson et al., 2002;Rab et al., 2017). The result is significantly different than that found in prior work.Low-energy Galactic CRs may be prevented from penetrating an extended heliosphere (or T-Tauriosphere) surrounding a young star due to its more powerful wind and increased magnetic stellar activity (Cleeves et al., 2013).

        <p>(i) Figure 10 shows the CR ionisation rate for maximum and minimum modulation by a TT stellar wind at 1 AU, corresponding to φ = 18 GeV and φ = 4.8 GeV, respectively, and labelled by "GCRs (max. modul.)" and "GCRs (min. modul.)".(i) Figure 10 shows the CR ionisation rate for maximum and minimum modulation by a TT stellar wind at 1 AU, corresponding to φ = 18 GeV and φ = 4.8 GeV, respectively, and labelled by "GCRs (max. modul.)" and "GCRs (min. modul.)".</p>
        <p>For completeness, the figure also shows the ionisation rate for the Galactic CR flux modulated by an average solar wind (φ = 1 GeV) labelled "GCRs (Sun. av. modul.)". Compared to Cleeves et al. (2013), the result for the minimum modulation model is larger by a factor of ∼ 30 at Σ 100 g cm -2 , while above Σ ∼ 1200 g cm -2 it decreases much more abruptly. The difference is even more dramatic for the maximum modulation model. Padovani et al. (2018b) predict an ionisation rate that is larger by a factor of ∼ 260 at Σ 100 g cm -2 and decreases faster above Σ ∼ 1400 g cm -2 . The discrepancy at low surface densities is large because Padovani et al. (2018b) included the process of electron-positron pair creation by photon decay and also adopted the relativistic behaviour of the ionisation cross section for protons. The faster decrease of their results at high surface densities is caused by losses due to heavy elements in the medium (see Sect. 3.2). It is noteworthy that the ionisation rate for the minimum and maximum modulation is almost entirely due to relativistic protons, propagating diffusively (see Sect. 3.3.1).For completeness, the figure also shows the ionisation rate for the Galactic CR flux modulated by an average solar wind (φ = 1 GeV) labelled "GCRs (Sun. av. modul.)".

        <p>(ii) For the proton flux generated in a TT flare, labelled in Fig. 10 by "SCRs (active TT)", results by Padovani et al. (2018b) for up to Σ ∼ 300 g cm -2 agree with those obtained by Rab et al. (2017) within 5%. At higher surface densities the ionisation rate decreases slowly, since electron-positron pairs increase the ionisation by orders of magnitude. It is important to remark that it is still unclear what fraction of CRs generated in a flare event can be channeled into the disc through magnetic field lines, without crossing the turbulent zone, and what part may follow open field lines perpendicular to the disc.(ii) For the proton flux generated in a TT flare, labelled in Fig. 10 by "SCRs (active TT)", results by Padovani et al.

        <p>Exactly how disc ionisation varies with distance and vertical scale height in a protostellar disc is critical to the onset of the MRI, which requires sufficient ionisation in order for the gas to couple with the magnetic field.

        <p>High-resolution, global disc simulations suggest the minimum value of Re for fully active MRI is ∼ 3000 (Flock et al., 2012). However, hydrodynamic simulations including ambipolar diffusion suggest there is no minimum value for Am for MRI (Bai and Stone, 2011), which underscores the importance of Re and hence local ionisation in disc dynamics. Many studies that resolve MRI turbulence directly assume a uniform value for the CR ionisation rate (Simon et al., 2018;Bai et al., 2019), but care should be taken because recent calculations show that the CR spectrum including a variety of energy loss mechanisms predict that the CR ionisation rate is far from being constant especially at the high column densities, typical of discs (see Sect. 5.1 and Fig. 9). If CR-produced ionisation exceeds thermal ionisation (inner &lt; 1 au) and/or ionisation produced by radionuclides (disc midplane), CRs will regulate the cycle of MRI activation and accretion (Offner et al., 2019). However, the coupling between the mean magnetic field and the CRs is also mediated by the degree of turbulence, which in turn is dictated by the MRI activity (Rodgers- Lee et al., 2017;Bai et al., 2019) -circumscribing a thoroughly non-linear problem.High-resolution, global disc simulations suggest the minimum value of Re for fully active MRI is ∼ 3000 (Flock et al., 2012).

        <p>CRs impinging on the disc are more likely to arise locally (see Sect. 6) than from external sources as mentioned above. If the CRs are produced by the stellar accretion shock then the nature and properties of the accretion flow are important to the disc evolution. While protostellar accretion rates are expected to be high ( Ṁ &gt; 10 -6 M yr -1 ) at early times, CRs accelerated in the accretion shock will likely undergo severe energy losses as they travel through the dense accretion flow to the disc (Offner et al., 2019). For accretion rates of ∼ 10 -7 -10 -9 M yr -1 , the CR flux accelerated at the shock is lower but likely less attenuated (Gaches and Offner, 2018;Offner et al., 2019). The relationship between the CRs accelerated at the shock, energy losses in the accretion flow and the MRI, which in turn dictates the rate of accreting gas, may form a feedback loop that mediates accretion in time and produces luminosity variation (Offner et al., 2019).CRs impinging on the disc are more likely to arise locally (see Sect. 6) than from external sources as mentioned above.

        <p>Older stellar sources also produce CRs at a lower level through stellar activity (as our Sun does). Direct modelling of particle trajectories in the inner 0.5 au of a TT disc suggests the local ionisation rate is spatially inhomogeneous and depends on the magnetic field morphology and assumed degree of turbulence (Fraschetti et al., 2018). However, it is worth noting that these simulations use a simplified model for the protoplanetary disc. The disc is assumed to be infinitely thin and massive. This implies that the SCRs suffer catastrophic energy losses when they penetrate the disc, which prevents radial transport of the SCRs in the disc. The complex relationship between CRs, gas chemistry and the magnetic field encompass a challenging, multi-scale, multi-physics problem that requires further study to explore the details of the propagation and impact of CRs on disc evolution.Older stellar sources also produce CRs at a lower level through stellar activity (as our Sun does).

Since studies of propagating interstellar CRs show that their flux is strongly attenuated at high column densities (see Sect. 5.1), CR at the protostellar surface is much lower than its interstellar value, so that L CR L accr close to the protostar.

The gravitational energy available for a massive protostar to generate CRs is even higher since Ṁ could reach 10 -3 M yr -1 .

        <p>DSA is produced because shock waves carry the scattering waves and then impose a bulk motion. At each shock crossing particles start to interact via head-on collisions and then systematically gain energy. On average (over a Fermi cycle, e.g., up-down-up stream) CRs gain ∆E/E ∝ (v/U ). This process is of particular interest because beside being more efficient it also produces power-law solutions that only depend on one parameter: the shock compression ratio (at least in the linear stage). Shocks are ubiquitous in the ISM and near protostars, but may be collisional and not expected to accelerate particles. Conversely, collisionless shocks require both sufficiently low density and high magnetisation.DSA is produced because shock waves carry the scattering waves and then impose a bulk motion.

        <p>There have been estimates of the expected luminosity and SCR spectrum for a young star using scaling law arguments relating to the Sun and X-ray observations of young stars (Feigelson et al., 2002). These estimates do not consider the exact acceleration mechanism but generally assume that the SCRs originate from stellar flares. Other specific locations for accelerating particles in the accretion and jet shocks are discussed in Sect. 6. The idea is to take the observed relationship between X-ray luminosity and proton fluence for the Sun to estimate the proton fluence for a young stellar object (YSO) using the known X-ray luminosity of YSOs. Feigelson et al. (2002) estimated that proton fluences produced by YSOs will be 10 5 times greater than observed from the most powerful solar flares. This factor of 10 5 combines a number of different factors. First, Chandra X-ray observations of low-mass stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) show increased X-ray luminosities in comparison to extreme solar events, which contributes a factor of ∼ 30. The ONC stellar flares also occur approximately ∼ 300 times more frequently than solar flares. This gives a total increase of 10 4 resulting from stellar X-ray flare emission. Finally, a factor of 10 represents the increased proton flux compared to the X-ray flux. This scaling has been used in Rab et al. (2017) for instance where the slope of the stellar CR spectrum is assumed to be the same as for the Sun. A similar argument for the SCR luminosity is presented in Rodgers- Lee et al. (2017), instead assuming a relationship between the power in the stellar wind and the power in the SCRs. Note that, while the flux of solar CRs is not constant, Feigelson et al. (2002) argue that the flux of YSO CRs can be considered to be constant due to overlapping magnetic flare events.There have been estimates of the expected luminosity and SCR spectrum for a young star using scaling law arguments relating to the Sun and X-ray observations of young stars (Feigelson et al., 2002).

        <p>The last important detail of this scaling argument is the high-energy cut-off for the stellar CRs. It seems likely that a YSO will be able to accelerate particles to higher energies than the Sun. As discussed in Rodgers- Lee et al. (2017), the break in the solar spectrum at ∼20 MeV to a steeper power law has been seen to shift up to an order of magnitude higher in energy during solar flare events (Ackermann et al., 2014;Ajello et al., 2014). This is perhaps indicative of the type of behaviour expected from YSOs. The location of this high-energy cut-off in the stellar CRs spectrum is of interest because MeV protons have a very large energy loss rate per grammage meaning that they will lose their energy faster relative to GeV protons, which are minimally ionising. Additionally, if diffusive transport is assumed for CRs, from quasi-linear theory GeV protons will have larger diffusion coefficients than MeV protons meaning that GeV protons will spend less time in the very dense inner regions of protoplanetary discs. Therefore, the presence of GeV protons would mean it is much more feasible for stellar CRs to contribute ionisation further out in the disc.The last important detail of this scaling argument is the high-energy cut-off for the stellar CRs.

        <p>To date, a number of groups have estimated the influence of stellar energy particles in protoplanetary discs (Rab et al., 2017;Rodgers-Lee et al., 2017;Fraschetti et al., 2018;Rodgers-Lee et al., 2019). The main ingredients of these models, which have been discussed in previous sections in detail, are the following: the properties of the SCRs (power and assumed spectrum), the loss rate of the SCRs, the propagation of the SCRs (ballistic, free streaming or diffusive transport) and the assumed properties of the protoplanetary disc itself. Modelling the influence of CRs in protoplanetary discs began with Turner and Drake (2009) who studied Galactic and stellar CRs with energies above 0.1 GeV and considered ballistic transport without any potential modulation by the T-Tauriosphere at these energies. More recently the idea that Galactic CRs would be significantly modulated by the stellar wind and its entrained magnetic field at ∼GeV energies led to the idea that instead stellar CRs might contribute significantly to the ionisation rate in protoplanetary discs. Rab et al. (2017) used a scaled up solar-like energy spectrum for the stellar CRs, following Feigelson et al. (2002), composed of two power-law components, which result in a sharp cut-off in the spectrum at energies above 20 MeV. They consider ballistic transport, i.e., ignore the effect of any possible magnetic fields, using CSDA for the energy losses of the CRs. Rodgers- Lee et al. (2017) also focused on the influence of ∼GeV stellar CRs in diffusive transport, which includes the influence of turbulent magnetic fields, with a constant energy loss rate for the CRs. Fraschetti et al. (2018) performed test particle simulations of stellar CRs propagating in the wind of a T Tauri star including catastrophic energy losses for the CRs, meaning that once particles crossed the plane of the geometrically thin disc they lost all their energy. These modelling approaches all have different strengths and weaknesses. Rab et al. (2017) very importantly focus on the chemical signatures of stellar CRs, which is vital for direct comparisons with observations and also treat the energy losses of the stellar CRs the most accurately. On the other hand, it seems unlikely that stellar CRs travel ballistically in protoplanetary discs. Here, the diffusive transport treatment and test particle simulations of Rodgers- Lee et al. (2017) and Fraschetti et al. (2018), which include the influence of magnetic fields, seem more reasonable.

        <p>It is non-trivial to compare these models, not simply because of the important differences mentioned above in the assumed properties, transport and energy losses of the stellar CRs, but because the stellar and disc properties considered are also different. Rodgers- Lee et al. (2019), using the diffusive approximation, present a parameter study that varies the disc surface density profile and the total disc mass using ranges constrained by ALMA dust observations of large samples of discs (Tazzari et al., 2017;Pascucci et al., 2016). For discs around solar-mass stars with a range of disc masses and surface density profiles, they find that stellar CRs produce larger ionisation rates than those expected from unmodulated Galactic CRs at ∼ 70 au close to the disc midplane. The 1/r profile expected in the absence of energy losses is recovered for many combinations of disc parameters, namely, for lowermass discs combined with shallower surface density profiles. This indicates that such discs are not dense enough to significantly attenuate stellar CRs in the limit of diffusive transport. In future work, it is important to investigate whether discs likely to exhibit high ionisation rates at large radii are observable with ALMA.It is non-trivial to compare these models, not simply because of the important differences mentioned above in the assumed properties, transport and energy losses of the stellar CRs, but because the stellar and disc properties considered are also different.

        <p>Enhanced CR fluxes may also arise locally from sources embedded within the cloud as a result of CRs produced by young forming stars. Models estimate that proto-clusters with &gt; 10 3 accreting members can produce a local CR flux that exceeds the typical Galactic value (Gaches and Offner, 2018). This CR feedback dissociates CO and warms the nearby molecular gas, raising the temperatures 10s of K (Gaches et al., 2019a). Massive clouds forming 10 6 M star clusters, such as the progenitors of globular clusters, may experience local CR fluxes that yield ionisation rates of ζ &gt; 10 -14 s -1 . Such high values are comparable to the observed CR ionisation rates inferred for extreme regions such as the Galactic centre.

However, observations with facilities such as the Very Large Array (VLA) or the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) disclosed the presence of non-thermal emission in a small number of sources. Usually this emission appears as spots surrounded by thermal emission (e.g., Nandakumar et al., 2016;Veena et al., 2016), contiguous to thermal emission as in cometary Hii regions (e.g., Mücke et al., 2002), or sometimes it appears isolated (Meng et al., 2019). As for the synchrotron emission observed in jet knots, non-thermal emission observed in Hii regions cannot have interstellar origin. In fact, the interstellar CR electron flux based on the most recent Voyager observations (Cummings et al., 2016;Stone et al., 2019) is too low to explain the observed flux density.

The same conclusion holds for the flux of secondary electrons created through ionisation processes by interstellar CRs, since Hii regions are often embedded within molecular clouds.</p>
        <p>A possible explanation for the origin of these relativistic electrons is local acceleration inside the Hii region itself through DSA, as proposed by Padovani et al. (2019). This assumes that shocks are located at the position where non-thermal emission is detected.

        <p>One key aspect of CRs on scales of kiloparsecs is their dynamical impact via a global CR pressure gradient and the ability to impact the dynamical evolution of galaxies via outflows. Consequently, on galactic scales we are primarily interested in the CR component that carries most of the energy, which are protons at a few GeV. The integrated energy in CRs is approximately CR ∼ 0.5 eV cm -3 and thus comparable to the magnetic energy in the ISM, mag ∼ 0.25 eV cm -3 for a magnetic field strength of 3 µG (Haverkorn, 2015;Beck, 2015). This approximate energy equipartition makes CRs a potentially relevant energy reservoir and suggests that there is mutual interaction between CRs and the magnetic field.One key aspect of CRs on scales of kiloparsecs is their dynamical impact via a global CR pressure gradient and the ability to impact the dynamical evolution of galaxies via outflows.

        <p>Treating CRs as test particles is therefore not justified. The typical gyroradii or scattering lengths of GeV protons with the magnetic field are significantly smaller than the scales under consideration, which allows for a fluid treatment of CRs. This high-energy fluid is then dynamically coupled to the MHD equation in a twofluid approach with an effective adiabatic index and a total pressure that includes the CR contributions (Hanasz and Lesch, 2003;Pfrommer et al., 2017).Treating CRs as test particles is therefore not justified.

        <p>GeV protons are primarily produced in SN remnants (Ackermann et al., 2013), which are among the strongest and most abundant shocks in the ISM. SNe in our galaxies are not uniformly distributed (Miller and Scalo, 1979;Heiles, 1987;Tammann et al., 1994). In our Galaxy, 20% of the SN are type Ia, which explode not only in the vicinity of star-forming regions but also high above the Galactic disk. Their distribution can be described by a Gaussian with a scale height of ∼ 300 pc. The remaining 80% are core collapse SNe, connected to massive stars above ∼ 8 M . The clustered formation of stars combined with the relatively short lives of massive stars results in clustered SNe. Approximately 60% of core collapse SNe explode close to their birth places, following a vertical Gaussian distribution with a scale height of only ∼ 100 pc. The remaining 40% are walkaway or runaway stars that escape the star cluster prior to explosion. The resulting vertical scale height is then comparable to the one of the type Ia SNe, i.e., 300 pc. The majority of the CRs are thus produced close to the disk with an effective scale height of ∼ 150 pc. The explosion sites extend approximately to a height of 1 kpc. Consequently, on scales at ∼ 100 pc, as discussed in the previous section, the CR distribution is relatively smooth due to the fast diffusion of CRs as well as the distributed injection. In contrast, on kpc scales above the disk, the enhanced injection close to the disk and the resulting CR pressure gradient must be taken into account.GeV protons are primarily produced in SN remnants (Ackermann et al., 2013), which are among the strongest and most abundant shocks in the ISM.

        <p>Under the assumption that the ISM in a galaxy has approximately uniform metallicity and that all particles in the ISM are equally likely to be accelerated to high-energies, we should expect a very similar composition for the CRs and the thermal gas. However, we notice an overabundance of light elements like Li, Be and B, which must be produced during CR transport through the medium (Aloisio and Blasi, 2013;Stone et al., 2013;Aguilar et al., 2015aAguilar et al., ,b, 2016a,b),b). Spallation is the most likely process to produce these secondary particles. A very common method to estimate the ratio of primary to secondary particles is the B/C abundance ratio. This ratio depends on the particle energy, but to zeroth order we observe approximately B/C = 0.3.Under the assumption that the ISM in a galaxy has approximately uniform metallicity and that all particles in the ISM are equally likely to be accelerated to high-energies, we should expect a very similar composition for the CRs and the thermal gas.

        <p>Frequent SNe create a relatively smooth distribution of GeV CRs in the ISM on scales of 0.1-1 kpc. The resulting small CR pressure gradients provide a relatively small force acting on the ISM compared to locally strongly varying thermal pressure gradients or gravitational forces in star-forming regions. As a result, the dynamical impact of CRs is most effective in the diffuse ISM and acts over longer timescales compared to the short dynamical time in the ISM (see also the previous section). In contrast to SN shocks, CRs provide an effective background force in the vertical direction that counteracts the gravitational attraction of the disk. Hydrodynamical simulations of the ISM including thermal and CR feedback confirm this simple picture of driving outflows. Including CRs increases the total amount of outflowing gas by a factor of a few up to an order of magnitude (Girichidis 2016, 2018, Kim &amp; Ostriker 2018, Mao &amp; Ostriker 2018).

        <p>On even larger scales, namely for full galaxies, CRs appear to be dynamically important for driving galactic outflows. Idealised simulations using anisotropic diffusion and an isothermal equation of state show that CRs alone are able to drive outflows with mass-loading factors of order unity (Hanasz et al., 2013). The efficiency of the outflows depend on the diffusion coefficient as well as the SN energy fraction that is converted into CRs. Salem and Bryan (2014) investigate this aspect in isolated disk galaxies. Indirectly, CRs also influence the dynamics by changing the magnetic strength and morphology in the disk (Pakmor et al., 2016). Anisotropic diffusion results in stronger magnetic fields, which in turn reduces the formation of dense molecular clouds and star formation (Girichidis et al., 2016(Girichidis et al., , 2018)). The details of CR-driven outflows like the mass and energy loading as well as the resulting heating in the ISM depend on the details of the transport (Zweibel, 2013(Zweibel, , 2017;;Ruszkowski et al., 2017;Farber et al., 2018). Currently developed models therefore couple CRs to the thermal gas as well as the magnetic fields in a more consistent way (Jiang and Oh, 2018;Thomas and Pfrommer, 2019) and investigate the CR interactions with spectrally resolved methods (Girichidis et al., 2019).On even larger scales, namely for full galaxies, CRs appear to be dynamically important for driving galactic outflows.

This material faces a variety of extreme conditions, including high turbulence, pressure, temperature, CR flux and ionising radiation flux, compared to gas elsewhere in the Galactic disc (Ao et al., 2013;Ginsburg et al., 2016;Henshaw et al., 2016;Schmiedeke et al., 2016;Krieger et al., 2017).

        <p>As for the Galactic disc, molecular abundances (e.g., H + 3 , OH + , H 2 O + , and H 3 O + ) have been used to infer CR ionisation rates within the CMZ. Observations of H + 3 absorption toward several different sight lines in the CMZ indicate ζ H 2 ∼ 10 -14 s -1 across most of the region (Oka et al., 2019). This is consistent with previous studies using H + 3 (Goto et al., 2013) and oxygen bearing ions (Indriolo et al., 2015) and with results from more detailed chemical modelling (Le Petit et al., 2016). All of these results indicate ionisation rates much higher than found in the Galactic disc, again implying spatial variations in the underlying particle spectrum.As for the Galactic disc, molecular abundances (e.g., H + 3 , OH + , H 2 O + , and H 3 O + ) have been used to infer CR ionisation rates within the CMZ.

        <p>Another constraint on the CR ionisation rate in the CMZ can be inferred from the temperatures of molecular clouds. Ionisation of H 2 by CRs liberates electrons with about 30 eV of kinetic energy on average (Cravens and Dalgarno, 1978), which then heat the gas through collisions. This means that any given ionisation rate sets a floor gas temperature due to CR-induced heating. By inferring gas temperatures in molecular clouds throughout the CMZ from molecular emission line observations, Ginsburg et al. (2016) placed an upper limit of ζ H 2 &lt; 10 -14 s -1 on the ionisation rate in the Galactic centre based on the floor gas temperature. Even with such a high ionisation rate, it is thought that turbulence, rather than CR ionisation, dominates gas heating in the CMZ. Still, at high ionisation rates CR heating will affect the gas temperature and thus the initial conditions in molecular clouds from which stars form (e.g. Clark et al., 2013).Another constraint on the CR ionisation rate in the CMZ can be inferred from the temperatures of molecular clouds.

        <p>Recent radio observations with the MeerKAT telescope show outflow bubbles that suggest a recent (&lt; few Myr) energetic event in the CMZ (Heywood et al., 2019), plausibly a burst of star formation (e.g. Krumholz et al., 2017), although feedback from the central supermassive black hole cannot be ruled out. Irrespective of its origin, it is possible that this event contributed to the high CR ionisation rate, especially given its large energy budget of ∼ 7 × 10 52 ergs (Heywood et al., 2019).

        <p>Clustering of young massive stars in star-forming regions has a profound effect on the structure and evolution of the ISM on 100 pc scales with a possibility of the break out of the thin HI Galactic disc in the form of chimneys (Mac Low and McCray, 1988;Tomisaka and Ikeuchi, 1986;Kim et al., 2017;El-Badry et al., 2019). The massive star-forming regions are structured as they are observationally represented by compact clusters of young massive stars as well as by highly substructured OB associations with lower stellar density than in the compact clusters (see, e.g., Krumholz et al., 2019;Ward et al., 2019). The winds of massive stars and their subsequent SNe create large-scale superbubbles and supershells in the ISM through their great momentum and energy release (see, e.g., Heiles, 1979;Mac Low and McCray, 1988;El-Badry et al., 2019). Such structures distribute the chemical elements freshly produced by massive stars and accelerate CRs. These components together with radiation and magnetic fields are essential components of stellar feedback inside star-forming molecular clouds (e.g. Fierlinger et al., 2016). Moreover, this stellar feedback may drive Galactic winds at kpc scales (e.g. Fielding et al., 2017). The high mechanical power released by the winds of massive early type stars and SNe in young stellar clusters or OB associations can exceed 10 38 erg s -1 over many million years. This mechanical luminosity blows out superbubbles of different sizes surrounded by massive supershells, which in some cases may produce sequential star formation in galaxies. The power of winds and SNe should produce mechanical work on the surrounding cold ISM and provide gas and dust heating through advection and thermal conduction. On the other hand, Rosen et al. (2014) studied the mechanical energy partition in some compact stellar clusters and found that a relatively small fraction of the injected energy goes into these channels. They suggested that turbulent mixing at the hot-cold inter-faces removes the kinetic energy injected by the winds of clustered massive stars. A similar issue was discussed by Cooper et al. (2004) for the superbubble DEM L192 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They found that a significant fraction of the mechanical power is not accounted for by the observed constituents.Clustering of young massive stars in star-forming regions has a profound effect on the structure and evolution of the ISM on 100 pc scales with a possibility of the break out of the thin HI Galactic disc in the form of chimneys (Mac Low and McCray, 1988;Tomisaka and Ikeuchi, 1986;Kim et al., 2017;El-Badry et al., 2019).

The winds of massive stars and their subsequent SNe create large-scale superbubbles and supershells in the ISM through their great momentum and energy release (see, e.g., Heiles, 1979;Mac Low and McCray, 1988;El-Badry et al., 2019). Such structures distribute the chemical elements freshly produced by massive stars and accelerate CRs. These components together with radiation and magnetic fields are essential components of stellar feedback inside star-forming molecular clouds (e.g. Fierlinger et al., 2016). Moreover, this stellar feedback may drive Galactic winds at kpc scales (e.g. Fielding et al., 2017). The high mechanical power released by the winds of massive early type stars and SNe in young stellar clusters or OB associations can exceed 10 38 erg s -1 over many million years. This mechanical luminosity blows out superbubbles of different sizes surrounded by massive supershells, which in some cases may produce sequential star formation in galaxies. The power of winds and SNe should produce mechanical work on the surrounding cold ISM and provide gas and dust heating through advection and thermal conduction. On the other hand, Rosen et al. (2014) studied the mechanical energy partition in some compact stellar clusters and found that a relatively small fraction of the injected energy goes into these channels. They suggested that turbulent mixing at the hot-cold inter-faces removes the kinetic energy injected by the winds of clustered massive stars. A similar issue was discussed by Cooper et al. (2004) for the superbubble DEM L192 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They found that a significant fraction of the mechanical power is not accounted for by the observed constituents.</p>
        <p>CRs can be accelerated in superbubbles (see for a review Binns et al., 2007;Bykov, 2014;Lingenfelter, 2018). The efficiency of the kinetic power transfer to CRs in the models with particle acceleration by multiple shocks can exceed 20% (Bykov, 2001). Therefore, CR pressure and the escaped CR energy fluxes should be accounted for in the energy balance of superbubbles (Butt and Bykov, 2008). Models of low-energy CRs accelerated in superbubbles by shocks and MHD turbulence predict time variable CR spectra at different evolutionary stages. The hydrogen in large-scale supershells surrounding the superbubbles is ionised by both the soft X-ray photons produced by the hot gas inside the superbubble and the low-energy CRs, which can penetrate deep into the shell depending on the CR transport in the shell. Fig. 12 illustrates a model for the hydrogen ionisation rate by CRs in the HI supershell of mass 10 5 M , thickness 30 pc and number density of 10 cm -3 . The red curve in the figure shows the ionisation rate of the HI shell by CRs accelerated in the superbubble derived for the model of the diffusive propagation of CRs in the shell with the diffusion coefficient D ∝ p 0.33 , which corresponds to a Kolmogorov spectrum of magnetic fluctuations. For large turbulent advection rms velocities in the subparsec scale or in the case of multiple weak shocks in the supershell (e.g. Bykov and Toptygin, 1987) the CR diffusion can be energy independent. This results in lower ionisation rates deep inside the HI shell, as illustrated by the blue curve in Fig. 12.CRs can be accelerated in superbubbles (see for a review Binns et al., 2007;Bykov, 2014;Lingenfelter, 2018).

        <p>Observations of the molecules used to infer CR ionisation rates are difficult even within the Galaxy, so these techniques have only been applied to a small sample of other galaxies. OH + and H 2 O + were observed with Herschel toward the nuclei of NGC 4418, Arp 220, and Mrk 231, suggesting ionisation rates on the order of about 10 -13 -10 -12 s -1 (González- Alfonso et al., 2013Alfonso et al., , 2018)). Like our own Galactic centre, these regions have rather high ionisation rates. OH + and H 2 O + have also been observed in absorption toward the discs of a small sample of nearby galaxies, such as NGC 253, M82, NGC 4945, CenA, where much lower ionisation rates -on the order of 10 -16 s -1 -were inferred (van der Tak et al., 2016). These values are more in line with those determined for the Galactic disc and provide further evidence for different ionisation rates and particle fluxes in Galactic nuclei compared to discs.Observations of the molecules used to infer CR ionisation rates are difficult even within the Galaxy, so these techniques have only been applied to a small sample of other galaxies.

        <p>Recently, ALMA has provided the opportunity to observe OH + and H 2 O + in galaxies at higher redshift where the rotational transitions out of the ground states are shifted to frequencies where the Earth's atmosphere is transparent. Both molecules have been detected in a foreground absorber at z = 0.89 toward the lensed quasar PKS 1830-211. The absorber is thought to be Milky-Way-like, and the two lensed images of the quasar provide two different sight lines through the disc of this galaxy, in which ionisation rates of about 10 -15 s -1 and 10 -14 s -1 are inferred (Muller et al., 2016).

        <p>In this review it has been shown that low-energy CRs represent a key element in several physical and chemical processes of the ISM, having a strong impact from the large scales of molecular clouds to the small scales of protostellar systems. During the last ten years, growing attention has been given to the study of the interaction of CRs with the ISM, and a significant progress has been made in understanding their transport regimes at different depths of a cloud and their interaction with magnetic fields. These studies demonstrated that the assumption of a constant CR ionisation rate, based on the fundamental studies of L. Spitzer in the '50s and used for many decades, is inaccurate. Indeed, CR ionisation rates span over at least 4-5 orders of magnitude from diffuse clouds (ζ ∼ 10 -15 s -1 ) to circumstellar disc midplanes (ζ 10 -19 s-1). This is an important warning for modelers of astrochemical codes and non-ideal MHD simulations of collapsing clouds and MRI in circumstellar discs. The use of a constant ζ can produce unrealistic values of chemical abundances and heavily affect magnetic decoupling and hence the fragmentation of molecular clouds. Besides, one must also consider the effect of the presence of local CR sources in single protostars and protostellar clusters that can locally enhance the CR flux, exceeding the typical Galactic value, with important feedback on the ionisation degree of the local medium, on the temperature, and ultimately on its chemical composition and dynamical evolution.In this review it has been shown that low-energy CRs represent a key element in several physical and chemical processes of the ISM, having a strong impact from the large scales of molecular clouds to the small scales of protostellar systems.

        <p>The study of low-energy CRs has opened a new line of research, allowing a strong synergy between theoretical models and observations. For instance, theory predicts that at the shock surface of high-mass protostellar jets should be possible to accelerate CRs up to tens of TeV from which should arise a spatially limited, but non-negligible, γ-ray emission. While current instruments such as H.E.S.S. and Fermi can hardly detect this localised emission because of their low resolution, it will be interesting to understand if the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be able to distinguish it from the background Galactic γ-ray emission. This detection, due to the local production of CR protons, that should be localised at the same spatial position of the synchrotron emission caused by locally accelerated CR electrons, would represent a double proof of the possibility of accelerating CRs in protostellar systems. We also note that thanks to future instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) with its huge field of view, high sensitivity, resolution, and survey speed, the detection of synchrotron sources would represent the rule rather than the exception. SKA precursors such as ASKAP, MeerKAT, E-LOFAR, will be of great importance for the first characterisation of synchrotron emission at different scales.The study of low-energy CRs has opened a new line of research, allowing a strong synergy between theoretical models and observations.

        <p>A new and growing frontier of astrophysics research explores the impact of CRs on exoplanetary atmospheres and habitability. CRs of both Galactic and stellar origin likely play a crucial role in the chemistry of planetary atmospheres and the development and characteristics of life. Exoplanet searches such as the MEarth project have focused specifically on finding exoplanets around M-dwarf stars, which are considered prime candidates to host rocky planets (Nutzman and Charbonneau, 2008). However, such stars experience strong stellar activity, and any planets within their relatively close-in habitable zones (&lt; 0.2 au) will be bombarded by stellar CRs (Grießmeier et al., 2005). The planet magnetosphere regulates the flux of CRs reaching the top of the planetary atmosphere (Atri et al., 2013;Grießmeier et al., 2015). Close-in planets, such as those in the Mdwarf habitable zone, however, are likely to be tidally locked to their host star, which leads to a smaller magnetic moment and weaker magnetosphere (Grießmeier et al., 2005(Grießmeier et al., , 2016)). CRs drive chemical reactions in the planet atmosphere that may interfere with the detection of bio-signatures (chemical markers produced by biological organisms), for example, by enhancing the abundance of methane and reducing the presence of ozone (Grießmeier et al., 2016;Tabataba-Vakili et al., 2016;Scheucher et al., 2018). The planet atmospheric density, even more than the magnetosphere, dictates the particle and radiation flux at the surface (Atri et al., 2013). CR interactions in the atmosphere produce electromagnetic radiation as well as high-energy secondary particles, which are harmful for DNA-based life on the surface (Dar et al., 1998). Models suggest that close-in, rocky planets with Earth-like atmospheres are sufficiently shielded that CR induced reduction of the ozone has a minor effect on the biological radiation dose at the surface (Grießmeier et al., 2016). In contrast, the surfaces of planets with atmospheres 10% of that of Earth may receive 200 times higher radiation doses, which is lethal to most Earth-like life (Atri et al., 2013). Future facilities such as ELT/HIRES, JWST, and ARIEL will help to disentangle the products of CR-driven chemistry from biological signatures and assessing the impact of high-CR environments on the prevalence of life in the Universe.A new and growing frontier of astrophysics research explores the impact of CRs on exoplanetary atmospheres and habitability.
