        <p>Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) are a group of substances of emerging concern in the context of environmental risk assessment (Arguello-Pérez et al., 2020;Mezzelani et al., 2018). Their continuous discharge into aquatic environments has led the European Commission to include them in a watch list of emerging water pollutants, within the Water Framework Directive (EC, 2020). This list (last updated in 2020) includes five PhACs (amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and venlafaxine), as well as o-desmethylvenlafaxine, the main metabolite of venlafaxine. A recent water policy directive establishing a watch list of substances for Union-wide monitoring (dated July 2022) also includes ofloxacin.Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) are a group of substances of emerging concern in the context of environmental risk assessment (Arguello-Pérez et al., 2020;Mezzelani et al., 2018).

        <p>The presence of PhACs in the environment can potentially influence both aquatic organisms and the ecosystem function (Chen et al., 2021;Maculewicz et al., 2022;Arguello-Pérez et al., 2020;Mezzelani et al., 2018). Organisms are exposed to PhACs through two main routes: waterborne (bioconcentration) and diet. The combined exposure is defined as bioaccumulation, the resulting discrepancy between the uptake and elimination processes (Arnot and Gobas, 2006). Bioaccumulation measurement is an essential part of risk assessment, to evaluate the scale that these emerging compounds may pose to the environment and their link with human populations (Ruan et al., 2020;Lagesson et al., 2016;Zenker et al., 2014;Nendza et al., 2018).The presence of PhACs in the environment can potentially influence both aquatic organisms and the ecosystem function (Chen et al., 2021;Maculewicz et al., 2022;Arguello-Pérez et al., 2020;Mezzelani et al., 2018).

        <p>In a preliminary study conducted in Sweden in 2009, Wennmalm and Gunnarsson described that, of a large group of 300 PhACs, 92 % were not biodegradable, 23 % of them had bioaccumulation potential, and 61 % were classified as toxic for aquatic organisms. Bioaccumulation potential was estimated according to the PhACs' lipophilicity, following the OECD criteria (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD Guideline, 2005). Log K OW &gt; 3 was interpreted as "potential to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms". In 2011, Howard and Muir (2011) rated 92 out of 275 PhACs commonly detected in the environment as potentially bioaccumulative, using quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR).In a preliminary study conducted in Sweden in 2009, Wennmalm and Gunnarsson described that, of a large group of 300 PhACs, 92 % were not biodegradable, 23 % of them had bioaccumulation potential, and 61 % were classified as toxic for aquatic organisms.

        <p>Nevertheless, discrepancies between predicted and measured concentrations could be significant. In fact, some authors recently stated that for ionic compounds such as PhACs, relying only on the K ow may lead to a degree of underestimation (Kowalska et al., 2021). The potential of bioaccumulation of PhACs is typically determined using two factors: Bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and Bioconcentration factor (BCF), the difference between them being that BCFs are studied in laboratory conditions and exclude dietary intake. Duarte et al. (2022) observed that lipophilicity is not a good predictor of the BCF of a group of neuroactive PhACs in fish, which in turn is highly influenced by experimental parameters (species, life stages and abiotic conditions). Bioaccumulation tests using field studies appear to best reflect environmental conditions, some of the disadvantages being timeconsumption and cost.Nevertheless, discrepancies between predicted and measured concentrations could be significant.

        <p>The availability of quality information is essential to improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty in hazard and risk assessments. Until the present, no criteria have been proposed to evaluate the quality of accumulation assays and, as such, there is a lack of uniformity in the reported studies. In this paper, the accumulation potential of PhACs in aquatic organisms is reviewed and compared. First, the different performed assays to determine bioaccumulation potential, and the experimental conditions they applied, are described. A wide database on BCF/BAF values has been collected and the main variables affecting the data have been considered. Finally, on the basis of the obtained results, the potential impact on food web transfer has been contemplated.The availability of quality information is essential to improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty in hazard and risk assessments.

        <p>Prior to laboratory testing, the organism is acclimatized over a period of 2 to 3 weeks (OECD 305 technical guidance). Uncontaminated water from natural sources is generally used for testing, to ensure specimen survival with no abnormal appearance or behaviour. The baseline laboratory controls include water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, lighting type and characteristics, calcium, ammonium, nitrite, alkalinity and salinity (for marine species). The OECD establishes dissolved oxygen values of ≥60 %. Water temperature depends on the fish or organism species (for most a temperature between 20 and 25 °C is established, with some species needing lower temperatures (e.g., Oncorhynchus mykiss or Rainbow trout: 13-17 °C; Gasterosteus aculeatus and three-spined stickleback: 18-20 °C). Temperature variation throughout testing should be less than ±2 °C, since larger deviations can affect biological parameters relevant for uptake and depuration, as well as cause organism stress. The pH value should be within the 6.0 to 8.5 range at test initiation. According to some researchers, the use of synthetic water (demineralized water with specific added nutrients) may result more suitable to guarantee uniformity over time. For instance, the composition of fresh river water (ISO 73463) can be prepared using CaCl 2 (220.5 mg/L), NaHCO 3 (63 mg/L), KCl (5.5 mg/L) and MgSO 4 (60.1 mg/L) in distilled water (Molina-Fernández et al., 2021).Prior to laboratory testing, the organism is acclimatized over a period of 2 to 3 weeks (OECD 305 technical guidance).

        <p>There are also recommended guidelines for test organism feeding (1 %-2 % body weight (bw)/day of lipid and protein content). Food remnants should be removed after feeding to avoid chemical absorption since they could reduce bioavailability and provide a secondary dietary source (OECD 305 technical guidance). Once the acclimation period has ended, the test substance is mixed into the water to begin the assay. To prepare spiked solutions agitation is the preferred method for dissolving the studied substances. The use of organic solvents (acetone, ethanol, methanol, dimethylsulfoxide or acetonitrile) is not generally recommended. However, a maximum level (0.1 mL L -1 ) is considered acceptable in the preparation of concentrated stock solutions. The solvent concentration must be reproducible in all treatments (OECD 305 technical guidance). Some authors have used a concentration of methanol up to 0.8 mg/L (Świacka et al., 2020).There are also recommended guidelines for test organism feeding (1 %-2 % body weight (bw)/day of lipid and protein content).

        <p>An alternative is the use of a solid-phase desorption dosing system. For example, Maulvault et al. (2018) prepared venlafaxine-enriched feed. The spiked solution was previously dissolved in ethanol and diluted with water. The organic solvent was then volatilized by a top-coating process to the pellets with a pressurized spraying container. Regarding the concentration level of the test substance, the OECD establishes concentrations of 1 % and 0.1 % of its LC 50 value.An alternative is the use of a solid-phase desorption dosing system.

        <p>The studied organisms are exposed to PhACs at one or more of the selected concentration levels. A control group (without the test substance) is subjected to identical laboratory conditions. The exposure time of the specimens to contaminants runs until SS is reached. Throughout exposure, samples (of both water and biota) are periodically collected. The concentration of the test substance in the water samples should be determined both prior the addition of the organisms and during the uptake phase. Throughout the test period the water should be sampled (N = 5) from the test tanks (from a central point), before feeding, and at the same time the organism is sampled. More frequent sampling after the introduction of the organisms may be useful to ensure stable concentrations. Organisms should be sampled on at least five occasions during the uptake phase. Exposure time and sampling frequency depend on the mode of action and the chemicalphysical properties of the substance. For example, for different species of fish the exposure time can range from 4 days (ibuprofen in Rainbow trout (O. mykiss) (Brozinski et al., 2013) to 40 days (venlafaxine and its metabolite in Loach (M. anguillicaudatus) (Qu et al., 2019). In the case of larvae, bioconcentration experiments are developed for shorter periods, between 72 and 120 h post fecundation (Molina-Fernández et al., 2021;Pan et al., 2018). The duration of the test can be shortened or extended if necessary, if it is demonstrated as necessary as per when steady-state is reached. As for sampling, normally three replicates of the organism and at least five water samples are collected at each point in time. The medium is renewed weekly (Lopes et al., 2022), or every 24 h (Gomez et al., 2021;Maulvault et al., 2018;Lu et al., 2018), after which the substance concentration is re-established to maintain nominal values.The studied organisms are exposed to PhACs at one or more of the selected concentration levels.

        <p>As mentioned earlier, aquatic organisms are exposed to chemicals via water uptake (bioconcentration), diet or both. The decision to conduct an aqueous or dietary exposure experiment should be based on water solubility and K ow of the test substance. For compounds with high water solubility and log K ow values between 1.5 and 6.0, as is the case for most PhACs, an aqueous exposure test should be considered first (OECD 305 technical guidance). To the best of our knowledge, only one study in the literature (Maulvault et al., 2018) uses both water and dietary exposure sources (see Table 1).As mentioned earlier, aquatic organisms are exposed to chemicals via water uptake (bioconcentration), diet or both.

        <p>This test includes two consecutive phases: exposure (uptake) and postexposure (depuration). During the uptake phase, the organism is exposed to a chemical compound at one or more concentration levels, under the conditions described above. To initiate the depuration phase, the remaining organisms are transferred to clean water, then the same water renewal and sampling procedures as during the exposure period are followed. The depuration phase is always necessary unless the uptake is negligible. Organisms should be sampled for the test substance on at least four occasions during this phase. This type of testing is more common in low trophic level organisms, such as molluscs.This test includes two consecutive phases: exposure (uptake) and postexposure (depuration).

        <p>Long-term studies in a controlled aquatic system, evenly contaminated with a chemical mixture, are ideal for identifying general patterns of behaviour. Water, sediments and biota are sampled on a daily or weekly basis for a period of more than three months. This type of test is particularly successful in evaluating biomagnification along the food web, as well as bioaccumulation. However, this type of experiment is infrequent in the scientific literature.Long-term studies in a controlled aquatic system, evenly contaminated with a chemical mixture, are ideal for identifying general patterns of behaviour.

        <p>Currently, there are no criteria regarding field studies. Organisms are exposed throughout their lifetime, so the concentrations within them are near steady-state. Water, sediment and biota are sampled, and a range of sampling points is a key to ensure the representativeness of the data. The analytical rigor applied throughout the sampling and analysis processes is fundamental for the quality of the data. Some practices, such as the use of tags for fish labeling, has been proposed to study the changes in bioaccumulation over time under field conditions (Grabicova et al., 2017). Other authors (de Solla et al., 2016;Gillis et al., 2014) have also field-deployed organisms (i.e., caged, previously sourced locally) in the aquatic environment over the course of several weeks. Furthermore, grab sampling conducted in conjunction with passive sampling may be a more reliable and less time-intense option for assessing relative time-weighted average spatial distribution of organic contaminant concentrations (Wilkinson et al., 2018;Vystavna et al., 2012). The use of passive sampling has been recommended as a method to mimic bioconcentration uptake without the use of live organisms. In the case of polar compounds such as PhACs, the use of Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) has been developed. Grabicova et al. (2017) concluded that integrative passive samplers with fish liver or kidney tissue can be complimentary exploratory tools and can help to distinguish between bioconcentration and bioaccumulation. The main inconvenience of this practice is the inaccessibility of the sampling rates for POCIS over long time periods.Currently, there are no criteria regarding field studies.

        <p>A complex approach that includes not only water and organisms but also sediment interactions is needed to better understand the fate of PhACs in the aquatic environment. Water sediments represent a potential secondary source of PhACs when the hydrological conditions change (Wilkinson et al., 2018;Koba et al., 2018). Moreover, some organisms (e.g. benthic invertebrates) are often exposed to contaminated sediment via ingestion of sediment particles. These organisms are highly important components of the food chain in aquatic environments and contribute significantly to fish diets. Usually, the sediments are collected in the same sampling point as the water samples. A few studies were recently published on this, for example Wilkinson et al. (2018) assessed the accumulation and spatial distribution of PhACs and other emerging pollutants in aquatic sediment and five under-studied organisms (periphyton, plants (Callitriche sp. and Potamogeton sp.), as well as amphipod crustaceans (G. pulex) and aquatic snails (B. tentaculate) (n = 65 in total) from the Hogsmill, Blackwater and Bourne Rivers in Southern England. Koba et al.

(2018) assessed the accumulation and spatial distribution of PhACs and other emerging pollutants in aquatic sediment and five under-studied organisms (periphyton, plants (Callitriche sp. and Potamogeton sp.), as well as amphipod crustaceans (G. pulex) and aquatic snails (B. tentaculate) (n = 65 in total) from the Hogsmill, Blackwater and Bourne Rivers in Southern England. Koba et al. (2018) analysed 18 PhACs and 7 metabolites in water, sediment and fish of a treated wastewater-affected pond during a one-year experiment in the Czech Republic.</p>
        <p>Validated methods and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) protocols must be followed to ensure reliable and accurate results. A key aspect that generates uncertainty in the BAF/BCF calculation is the concentration of the compound in the water, since in many cases its value is close to the chosen method's determined detection limit. In these cases, the concentration is generally reported as "non-detected". The statistical treatment used to address "non-detected" samples can have significant effect on the derivation of the BAF.Validated methods and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) protocols must be followed to ensure reliable and accurate results.

        <p>In order to detect PhACs in the water, matrices between 50 and 1000 mL are often required. After filtration, solid phase extraction (SPE) is the most commonly applied technique. Given the nature of biota samples, a more complex sample preparation is required prior to analysis. In the case of fish, tissues and organs are first separated for individual analyses. In the case of molluscs, cephalopods and crustaceans, they are generally removed from the shells (if present) and then pooled, without differentiating body cavities. Samples are then powdered to homogeneity and, in most cases, freeze-dried. The sample preparation involves the extraction and clean-up steps. Ultrasonic solvent extraction (USE) is still widely applied. Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), microwave assisted extraction (MAE), matrix solid phase extraction (MSPD) and Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) have also emerged in last few years. For clean-up dispersive-SPE (d-SPE), C18 and PSA sorbents are frequently used. Finally, for adequate identification and quantification of compounds, and in order to define the lower bound detection limits, liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry detector (LC-MS/MS) is the most suitable technique (Arenas et al., 2021;Álvarez-Ruiz and Picó, 2020;Miossec et al., 2020).In order to detect PhACs in the water, matrices between 50 and 1000 mL are often required.

        <p>One of the main explanations for the lack of data uniformity is the disparate factors used in the design of the surveys (water temperature, exposure time, exposure route, dissolved organic matter, feeding and growth rates, or selected tissue or organ). BCF values are highly influenced by experimental and biotic factors (Duarte et al., 2022). Some authors have pointed to temperature and exposure time as the variables higher weight in BCF data. Maulvault et al. (2018) assessed the effect of increased temperature (ΔT°C = 5 °C) and high CO 2 levels (equivalent to ΔpH = -0.4 units). Their data suggest an increase of BCF with the combination of warming and acidification. Recently, Cerveny et al. (2021b) assessed how temperature affects temazepam biotransformation and the subsequent accumulation of its metabolite (oxazepam) in two organisms of the food chain ecosystem (the European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and the dragonfly larvae (Sympetrum sp.). Their results showed that exposure to PhACs may change across temperature gradients in the environment. While the bioconcentration of temazepam in perch was reduced at higher temperatures as a consequence of the biotransformation and accumulation of its main metabolite in the fish (two-fold higher at 20 °C compared to 10 °C), no temperature influence was found for larvae. Temperature may affect metabolic activity and, as a consequence, the bioconcentration pattern (Buckman et al., 2004). In a previous study, Opperhuizen et al. (1998) observed an increase in BCF values for chlorinated benzenes with increasing water temperature. In other research, Lu et al. (2018) reported that in the presence of higher dissolved organic matter content (DOM), the potential bioconcentration of diclofenac in fish decreased significantly. Feeding and the hydrodynamic experiment also led to lower bioaccumulation of diclofenac in fish tissues.One of the main explanations for the lack of data uniformity is the disparate factors used in the design of the surveys (water temperature, exposure time, exposure route, dissolved organic matter, feeding and growth rates, or selected tissue or organ).

        <p>Taking into account the route of exposure, in the case pf PhACs exposure through water may be more important for uptake and bioaccumulation rates than dietary exposure (Du et al., 2014). For example, Maulvault et al. (2018) observed plasma concentration levels of venlafaxine 50 times higher in fish exposed via water (46 μg/L day) compared to fish exposed via diet (0.5 μg/L day). Nunes et al. (2020) suggested that direct (waterborne) and trophic (via contaminated feed) exposures to diclofenac caused significantly different physiological modifications in aquatic organisms. Variability of results is reduced if standard protocols are met and with better knowledge of the key experimental parameters. Heynen et al. (2016) compare uptake of oxazepam from water (bioconcentration) and via a contaminated diet (trophic transfer) in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) and dragonfly larvae (Aeshna grandis). Bioconcentration and trophic transfer of oxazepam were found in both predator species. However, higher bioconcentrations were observed for perch (BCF 3.7) than for dragonfly larvae (BCF 0.5). The relative contribution via prey consumption was 14 % and 42 % for perch and dragonflies, respectively.Taking into account the route of exposure, in the case pf PhACs exposure through water may be more important for uptake and bioaccumulation rates than dietary exposure (Du et al., 2014).

        <p>Though theoretically BCF should not be affected by the concentration to which the organism is exposed since it is a result of the difference between the absorption and elimination processes, different levels were regularly tested in the reviewed literature. In some cases, a different bioconcentration pattern has been observed, suggesting that this factor must be taken into consideration (Lopes et al., 2022;Świacka et al., 2020;Lu et al., 2018;McCallum et al., 2019;Pan et al., 2018;Molina-Fernández et al., 2021;Xie et al., 2020;Brozinski et al., 2013). Pan et al. (2018) reported that the BCF of fluoxetine in red crucian carp was inversely proportional to the exposure concentrations. Similarly, Zhao et al. (2016) observed that the BCF of sulfamethazine at a concentration of 40 ng mL -1 was higher than at 200 ng mL -1 . Rosa et al. (2019) observed that the oxytetracycline levels in the macroalgae Ulva decreased significantly slower at 40 ng mL -1 (48 h) than at 120 ng mL -1 (24 h).Though theoretically BCF should not be affected by the concentration to which the organism is exposed since it is a result of the difference between the absorption and elimination processes, different levels were regularly tested in the reviewed literature.

        <p>On the other hand, for organic substances there is a clear correlation between the lipid content of biota and BCF values (Miller et al., 2019;Gobas et al., 1999). Hydrophobic substances (log K ow &gt; 3) reach equilibrium in the lipid fraction and the bioaccumulation potential is theoretically indicated by log Kow. Arnot and Gobas (2006) reported that doubling the lipid content approximately doubles the BCF. Thus it is important to normalize lipids to reduce variability and allow better comparison of results. However, bioaccumulation is also empirically demonstrated by organism concentrations exceeding the surrounding water concentration (Meredith-Williams et al., 2012;Grabicova et al., 2015). Variations of the pH in the exposure system may significantly change the ionization states of PhACs and consequently influence their bioaccumulation. A number of studies on aquatic organisms and on a range of PhACs (sertraline, fluoxetine, sulfathiazole, ciprofloxacin, lincomycin, enrofloxacin and chlortetracycline, ibuprofen or acetaminophen) have demonstrated that uptake and toxicity of ionizable PhACs can also be very sensitive to changes in pH of the environment (Meredith-Williams et al., 2012;Rendal et al., 2011;Valenti et al., 2009). For example, Ding et al. (2016) examined the bioconcentration profiles of roxithromycin and propranolol in D. magna after 24 h of exposure under different pH levels (7-9). Their results showed that daphnia body burdens were strongly dependent on pH and increased with increasing pH values. The fractions of neutral species, which are more lipophilic than the corresponding ionic species, increase with increasing pH levels. Because almost 80 % of all pharmaceuticals are ionizable (Manallack, 2008), thus having a pH-dependent neutral species distribution, the K ow may be a less reliable predictor of bioaccumulation than for neutral organic chemicals.On the other hand, for organic substances there is a clear correlation between the lipid content of biota and BCF values (Miller et al., 2019;Gobas et al., 1999).

        <p>There is no apparent relationship between BCF values and log K ow for PhACs (Duarte et al., 2022). The statistical correlation between accumulation data reported in Table 2 (BCF and BAF) and log Kow was R 2 &lt; 0.1. Therefore, understanding and establishing a framework for the bioaccumulative behaviour of PhACs is crucial for assessing risks for aquatic ecosystems. Bioconcentration is also controlled by organism tissue components other than lipids. For example, Arnnok et al. (2017) andLu et al. (2018) found higher bioaccumulation patterns in brain, liver or gill tissue compared with muscle tissue, indicating the possibility of distribution variance across tissues. The data are not normalized for lipids because, as the authors explain, it is not appropriate to do this for ionizable compounds (Haddad et al., 2018;Ramirez et al., 2009;Grabicová et al., 2020). In fact, a new "non-classical" bioaccumulation behaviour is observed where some authors have suggested that proteins may have a significant effect on the PhAC bioaccumulation process (Duarte et al., 2022;Maculewicz et al., 2022). Kowalska et al. ( 2021) demonstrated higher affinity of drug metabolites for blood proteins than for lipids. Haddad et al.

        <p>Special attention is also being paid to metabolites and transformation products. These can be just as dangerous, if not more so, than their parent compounds (Świacka et al., 2022;Maculewicz et al., 2022). Metabolites usually have high hydrolytic stability and this increases the likelihood that they will accumulate in the tissues of organisms (Kowalska et al., 2021). An example of this is antidepressants. A study conducted by Arnnok et al. (2017) reported a high bioaccumulation (BCF up to 3000) of norsertraline (sertraline metabolite). This metabolite accumulates mainly in the liver and brain of fish. The BCF for sertraline (more lipophilic) was lower than 100. The authors attribute this to the metabolization of sertraline by fish, although they also state that further studies are needed to confirm the process. The same mechanism was not observed for norfluoxetine (the main metabolite of fluoxetine) whose BCF was &lt;130. A study developed by Zhao et al. (2016), in medaka (O. melastigma) after exposure to sulfamethazine showed that its metabolite (acetylsulfamethazine) accumulated more readily in the organism (mainly in the gonad), presenting a different distribution pattern from that of the parent compound.Special attention is also being paid to metabolites and transformation products.

        <p>(100 and 1000 μg/L) significantly decreased drug accumulation in crucian carp compared to single exposure to diclofenac (Xie et al., 2020). The mixture at higher levels also led to severer hepatic oxidative stress. However, co-exposure studies are relatively recent and in some cases contradictory. Zhang et al. (2019) found that the presence of microplastics increases the bioaccumulation of roxithromycin in red tilapia fish tissue, while the study by Wang et al. (2020) indicated that co-exposure with nanoplastics leads to reduced bioaccumulation and accelerated biodegradation of ibuprofen in freshwater algae. These results suggest the likelihood of erroneously estimating risks to aquatic organisms without taking environmental factors into account. Thus, when BAF data are available they should be considered the better source of information of the bioaccumulative potential of a substance. According with reported data, BAF values are superior to BCF values, highlighting the importance of field studies for reliable assessment under real conditions (Fig. 3). For example, for citalopram and its main metabolite, the mean BAF values are almost 100 and 1000 times higher respectively than the corresponding BCF values. This was also observed by Arnot and Gobas (2006) when both factors were compared for a total of 350 organic substances.(100 and 1000 μg/L) significantly decreased drug accumulation in crucian carp compared to single exposure to diclofenac (Xie et al., 2020).

        <p>While the majority of PhACs are relatively water soluble and are generally non-bioaccumulative, resident biota can be chronically exposed to them due to the continuous release of these active compounds into ecosystems. Overall, a substance is usually considered very bioaccumulative if BAF values are &gt;5000 L kg -1 in aquatic organisms, and as bioaccumulative if the BAF values are between 2000 and 5000 L kg -1 (Government of Canada, 2000). Some authors have used this general classification given that, in practice, there is no unified classification criterion for the bioaccumulation potential of PhACs (Burket et al., 2020;de Solla et al., 2016;Chen et al., 2015;Na et al., 2013). According to reported data, although most PhACs are considered non-bioaccumulative (BAF &lt; 2000 L kg -1 ), we found that 38 out of 113 PhACs identified in this review ever exceed the BAF of 2000 criterion (although it was &lt;12 % and 6 % of the BAF and BCF data). In a study with 20 antibiotics in the coastal environment of Dalian (China) using three clam species as target aquatic organisms, Na et al. ( 2013) categorized sulfamethazine, sulfamethiazole, sulfamonomethoxine, and doxycycline as potentially bioaccumulative, while sulfadiazine, sulfameter, sulfamethoxypyridazine, and chloramphenicol were bioaccumulative.While the majority of PhACs are relatively water soluble and are generally non-bioaccumulative, resident biota can be chronically exposed to them due to the continuous release of these active compounds into ecosystems.

        <p>Like BCF data, reported BAF data vary between studies and organisms. One of the main reasons for this variability is ecosystem type. The spatial and temporal variability associated with sampling is a major difficulty in obtaining reliable bioaccumulation information from field data. The steady-state assumption may not always be correct. For the evaluation to be representative, long-term conditioning of the study area is recommended (Burkhard et al., 2013;Arnot and Gobas, 2006;US-EPA, 2000). Reported studies describe between five (Xie et al., 2019) and twenty (Na et al., 2013) sampling areas and a sampling frequency between one (Chen et al., 2015) and two (Na et al., 2013). However, it is very difficult to carry out true random sampling as a consequence of the high economic and ecological costs (Świacka et al., 2022). BAF data are complex and seem organ, species and compound-specific. A large study conducted by Huerta et al. (2018) investigated the prevalence of PhACs in fish representing different trophic niches from 25 U.S. rivers and streams. The results suggested that the uptake of PhACs may be selective. Freshwater omnivorous fish accumulated a greater variety of PhACs of different therapeutic categories than the co-habitant carnivores and invertivores. Rojo et al. (2019) obtained similar conclusions. Grabicová et al. (2020) reproduced a common aquaculture practice to evaluate the accumulation of PhACs in common prey of one omnivorous and one piscivorous fish for a period of 6 months. The authors found different bioaccumulation rates of PhACs between fish species. It is also interesting to note that in this study the highest levels of PhACs were found in plankton with BAF &gt; 4000. In addition, organ-specific bioaccumulation was very clear for sertraline among other PhACs (brain &gt; liver &gt; kidney) for both species, while low concentrations were found in muscle tissue. Bao et al. (2020) reported differences in PhAC bioaccumulation among 5 wild fish species from Taihu Lake (China). Medroxy-progresterone was the PhAC with the highest BAF (1474 L kg -1 ) in C. carpio, hexesestrol (1400 L kg -1 ) in C. auratus, dienoestrol (893 L kg -1 ) in H. molitrix and A. nobilis, and D-norgestrel (2460 L kg -1 ) in Anabarilius sp. Similar results were also obtained by Du et al. (2014), Haddad et al. (2018) and Rojo et al. (2019). It has also been reported that kinetic differences and particular metabolic biotransformation can lead to differences in the bioaccumulation potential of certain life-stages (Świacka et al., 2022).Like BCF data, reported BAF data vary between studies and organisms.

        <p>Finally, an important limitation is that most of the studies only determined PhACs in biota and water and did not examine suspended solids or sediments on which the more hydrophobic PhACs will be adsorbed. In a screening study considering 66 PhACs in the Tejo Estuary, Fonseca et al. (2021) reported that only 2 compounds were found simultaneously in water and biota, demonstrating the complex dynamics and behaviour of PhACs. Nevertheless, higher detection frequencies were observed in benthic and demersal species living directly on or just above the substrate, supporting the combined roles of sediment and dietary routes of PhAC uptake. Many other studies (Oetken et al., 2005;Lagesson et al., 2016;Xie et al., 2017;Wilkinson et al., 2018) have emphasized that filter-feeding organisms concentrate higher amounts of PhACs, due to their higher polluted environment and ingestion of organic matter from sediments.Finally, an important limitation is that most of the studies only determined PhACs in biota and water and did not examine suspended solids or sediments on which the more hydrophobic PhACs will be adsorbed.

        <p>An important aspect to be addressed in the present review is the transfer of PhACs to the food web. The data on trophic transfer of PhACs are still very limited (Ruan et al., 2020;Du et al., 2014;Ruhí et al., 2016;Lagesson et al., 2016) although a general trend indicates that lower trophic position organisms bioaccumulate PhACs to a greater extent than higher trophic position organisms (Ding et al., 2015;Vernouillet et al., 2010;Xie et al., 2017;Du et al., 2014;Ruhí et al., 2016). Detritivores and herbivores, benthic primary consumers at lower trophic levels, were confirmed as the primary bioaccumulators of PhAC contamination in a semi-natural pond ecosystem (Lagesson et al., 2016). PhACs were quantified at concentration levels ranging from &lt;0.03 to 5.88 ng g -1 w.w. in 24 species of molluscs, crustaceans and fish in a subtropical marine food web (Ruan et al., 2020). Trophic dilution was observed. Generally, invertebrate organisms had higher concentration levels than fish (TMFs 0.164 and 0.517 for atenolol and chloramphenicol, respectively). This can be explained by the fact that higher-level organisms have a greater capacity to metabolize substances. Similarly, trophic dilution was reported for 6 antidepressants (TMFs 0.01-0.71) in a semi-arid urban river, influenced by snowmelt and downstream from a municipal effluent discharge. The results were comparable at all locations and in all seasons, regardless of the different exposure conditions and concentrations (Haddad et al., 2018). Du et al. (2014) reported that PhACs accumulated in higher concentrations in invertebrates compared to fish in samples from an effluent-dependent stream. The authors reported a TMF of 0.38 and 1.17 for diphenhydramine and carbamazepine, respectively. The compounds detected in all the analysed species showed that none of them experienced trophic biomagnification. The study carried out by Xie et al. (2017) in the second largest lake in China (Taihu Lake) revealed the presence of antibiotics, NSAIDs and hormones in plankton, zoobenthos, shrimp and fish, the second of these recording the highest concentrations.

        <p>These results support the data that waterborne and not dietary exposures represent the primary route of fish uptake. Nevertheless more research is needed on the use of TMFs in bioaccumulation assessments and regulatory considerations (Świacka et al., 2022;Haddad et al., 2018).These results support the data that waterborne and not dietary exposures represent the primary route of fish uptake.

        <p>This review summarizes all the recent advances examining bioaccumulation of PhACs in aquatic organisms. A total of 231 BCFs and 531 BAF determined for 113 PhACs have been collected. Without a doubt, there is much more data on fish and molluscs (63 % of the collected data) compared with crustaceans (10 %), insects (8 %) and algae or larvae (6 %). Large differences in reported data (organ, species and compound-specific) have been found. Some PhACs such as the antidepressant group, diphenhydramine, diclofenac or carbamazepine have been extensively studied in comparison with other groups of pharmaceuticals.This review summarizes all the recent advances examining bioaccumulation of PhACs in aquatic organisms.

        <p>1) There is an urgent need for more data on certain therapeutic groups of PhACs, such as anticancer drugs. In addition, certain PhACs can accumulate significantly in the body of aquatic organisms through biotransformation of the parent compound, without being present in the water at all. Metabolization and biotransformation have been shown to be an important exposure pathway, contributing significantly to direct uptake from the water. Therefore, PhAC metabolites should be given more attention in future research, as many can exert pharmacological effects comparable to parent drugs. 2) Water characteristics such as temperature and pH or DOM have been shown to significantly affect bioconcentration of certain PhACs in aquatic organisms. While physico-chemical properties of water vary greatly, knowledge about their role in the uptake, metabolic transformation, and excretion of PhACs is still limited. Temperature, for instance, is cause for concern given that this factor is a fundamentally important environmental variable influencing standard metabolic rates, for example in fish (Clarke and Johnston, 1999;Killen et al., 2010;Ohlberger et al., 2012). On the other hand, improving scientific knowledge requires stricter adherence to standard protocols and better documentation of the key experimental parameters. The complexity and variability of the results will be reduced with compliance to specific criteria. 3) BCF data from PhACs have been poorly correlated with lipophilicity. It seems that ionizable chemicals follow a new "non-classical" bioaccumulation behaviour where proteins may have a significant effect on the process. Therefore, it is extremely important to conduct further studies using a broader group of compounds to elucidate these relationships and assess to what extent their affinity for blood proteins translates into their potential for bioaccumulation. 4) Recent co-exposure studies have also flagged the likelihood of underestimating the risks to aquatic organisms by not taking into account an environmental scenario since, in the natural environment, PhACs occur as complex mixtures and in the company of other contaminants that could cause a dissimilar effect on the organism. Reported BAF values are superior to laboratory BCF values, highlighting the importance of field studies for reliable assessment and the best reflection of natural conditions. Some practices, such as taking into account long-term average conditions of the studied area, or the use of wellcalibrated passive samplers, are crucial for reliable results and accurately calculated field-derived BCF values, respectively. 5) Finally, and regarding trophic transfer in aquatic ecosystems, benthic primary consumers at lower trophic levels concentrate higher amounts of PhACs due to the higher polluted environment and the ingestion of organic matter from sediments. Waterborne rather than dietary exposure represent the primary route of uptake of fish although, to date, the studies are too limited and the data insufficient to draw clear conclusions. Further research should be also conducted to study the bioaccumulation of PhACs in non-target species and other trophic positions.1) There is an urgent need for more data on certain therapeutic groups of PhACs, such as anticancer drugs.
