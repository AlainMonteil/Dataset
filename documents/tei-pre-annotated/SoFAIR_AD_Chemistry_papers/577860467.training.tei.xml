        <p>The accurate characterization of prototypical bricks of life can strongly benefit from the integration of high resolution spectroscopy and quantum mechanical computations. We have selected a number of representative amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, cysteine, threonine, aspartic acid and asparagine) to validate a new computational setup rooted in quantum-chemical computations of increasing accuracy guided by machine learning tools. Together with low-lying energy minima, the barriers ruling their interconversion are evaluated in order to unravel possible fast relaxation paths. Vibrational and thermal effects are also included in order to estimate relative free energies at the temperature of interest in the experiment. The spectroscopic parameters of all the most stable conformers predicted by this computational strategy, which do not have low-energy relaxation paths available, closely match those of the species detected in microwave experiments. Together with their intrinsic interest, these accurate results represent ideal benchmarks for more approximate methods.The accurate characterization of prototypical bricks of life can strongly benefit from the integration of high resolution spectroscopy and quantum mechanical computations.

        <p>Thanks to its high resolution and noninvasivity, gas-phase molecular spectroscopy has become the method of choice to investigate the role of intrinsic stereoelectronic effects in tuning the physical-chemical properties of biomolecule building blocks. 1,2 In particular, the supersonic-jet expansion technique 3 coupled to laser ablation 4 is allowing the recording of gas-phase microwave (MW) spectra for these thermolabile compounds, which are usually characterized by high melting points. 5 However, the fast relaxation of some structures to more stable counterparts in the presence of low energy barriers can bias any direct thermochemical interpretation of the results provided by this technique. 6,7 Accurate quantum chemical (QC) computations can help to solve this kind of problem, 8,9 but the effective exploration of flat potential energy surfaces (PESs) and the characterization of their stationary points for medium-to large-size flexible systems are still challenging for at least two different reasons. From the one side, the size of the systems prevents a brute force approach employing very accurate but very expensive state-of-the-art QC methodologies. [10][11][12] From the other side, the very powerful local optimization techniques developed for semirigid systems are not effective for the exploration of rugged potential energy surfaces (PES) characterized by a huge number of energy minima possibly separated by low-energy barriers. 13,14 This situation calls for an integrated computational approach employing QC models of increasing accuracy in the different steps of an exploration/exploitation strategy guided by machine learning (ML) tools. 13,[15][16][17] The effective strategy of this kind we have been developing in the past few years starts from a knowledge-based selection and constrained geometry optimizations of a limited number of conformers employing a fast semiempirical method. 14,18 Next, an effective exploration of the whole conformational PES is performed by the same semiempirical method guided by a purposely tailored evolutionary algorithm with the aim of finding other low-lying minima. 13 The results of this step are refined by hybrid and then double-hybrid density functionals, 19,20 and possible relaxation paths between pairs of adjacent energy minima are identified. 16 Once a panel of low-energy minima has been defined, accurate relative energies are computed by reducedscaling composite methods. [21][22][23][24][25][26] These results are integrated by zero point energies (ZPE) and thermal contributions to enthalpies and entropies employing anharmonic approaches rooted in the second order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34] and proper treatment of hindered rotations. 35,36 Finally, accurate spectroscopic parameters of the energy minima with nonnegligible populations under the experimental conditions of interest are computed. 37 In the specific case of rotational spectroscopy, improved equilibrium rotational constants are obtained by refining the optimized geometries by a linear regression approach. 20,38 Among the main biomolecule building blocks, natural αamino acids, which exist exclusively in neutral form in the gas phase, represent a particularly appealing playground because their rich conformational landscape is tuned by the competition among different kinds of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. At the same time, MW results are available for several conformers of most natural α-amino acids, [39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50] which represent very demanding benchmarks for the a priori prediction of structural and spectroscopic parameters. We have therefore selected the glycine and alanine prototypes together with a panel of α-amino acids with polar side chains (serine, threonine, cysteine, aspartic acid, and asparagine) with the aim of providing benchmark results allowing unbiased comparisons with experimental results. In fact, the current standards for the computation of MW parameters of biomolecule building blocks in the gas phase (see, e.g., refs 1, 6, 7, 39, and 51) employ QC methods of limited accuracy, pay marginal attention to the geometrical parameters, and neglect vibrational corrections. However, these limitations hamper any a priori prediction of the spectroscopic outcome, allowing at most its a posteriori interpretation in terms of the agreement between experimental and computed spectroscopic parameters for a predefined number of conformers.Thanks to its high resolution and noninvasivity, gas-phase molecular spectroscopy has become the method of choice to investigate the role of intrinsic stereoelectronic effects in tuning the physical-chemical properties of biomolecule building blocks. 1,2 In particular, the supersonic-jet expansion technique 3 coupled to laser ablation 4 is allowing the recording of gas-phase microwave (MW) spectra for these thermolabile compounds, which are usually characterized by high melting points. 5 However, the fast relaxation of some structures to more stable counterparts in the presence of low energy barriers can bias any direct thermochemical interpretation of the results provided by this technique. 6,7 Accurate quantum chemical (QC) computations can help to solve this kind of problem, 8,9 but the effective exploration of flat potential energy surfaces (PESs) and the characterization of their stationary points for medium-to large-size flexible systems are still challenging for at least two different reasons.

        <p>Based on these premises, the goal of the present study is to improve and validate a general strategy able to find all the conformers detectable in supersonic jet expansions taking also into account fast relaxation processes possibly leading to the disappearance of some low-lying species. Unbiased comparison with spectroscopic results is made possible by the accuracy of the computational results, which will be shown to provide mean unsigned errors (MUEs) within 20 MHz for rotational constants and 10 cm -1 for both relative energies and vibrational frequencies (entering zero point energies and thermal contributions to thermodynamic functions). Together with their intrinsic interest of the studied molecules, these results will provide also a reference set for more approximate methods and/or search techniques.Based on these premises, the goal of the present study is to improve and validate a general strategy able to find all the conformers detectable in supersonic jet expansions taking also into account fast relaxation processes possibly leading to the disappearance of some low-lying species.

        <p>The general strategy for the exploration of conformational PESs is based on a continuous perception of molecular structures performed by the 
            <rs type="software">PROXIMA</rs> software, 52 which is able to detect characteristic structural motifs and to separate soft (in the present context dihedral angles) and hard degrees of freedom. Then, a knowledge-based systematic search of soft degrees of freedom 14 can be optionally performed, which produces a panel of guess structures (e.g., the 3 n staggered conformers generated by rotations around n nonterminal single bonds, which are not a part of cycles). The geometries of these candidates are next optimized using the fast GFN2-XTB semiempirical method, 18 which has been selected because it tends to underestimate energy differences (i.e., to produce a too large set of candidates), which allows a safer use of energy thresholds for further processing. Next, a custom implementation of the island model evolutionary algorithm (IM-EA) 53 is employed to produce other candidates starting from an initial population (P 0 ) generated by the so-called Latin Hypercube stratified sampling 54 in order to maximize the diversity of soft degrees of freedom. The chemical descriptor (fitness) of each structure is the relative electronic energy obtained by GFN2-XTB geometry optimizations of the stiff degrees of freedom. Improved populations are then built iteratively for a given number of cycles by applying, with predetermined probability, different genetic operators, namely, crossover (interpolation of the features of different related structures for creating new ones), mutation (change of one or more soft degrees of freedom with some stochastic rule), and selection (high chance for high fitness structures of propagating their features in the next cycles). In the IM-EA, the different operators act separately on disjoint regions of the conformational landscape (islands), which are mixed only at predefined intervals by a dedicated operator (migration). Furthermore, some of the best structures found in each cycle are directly transferred to the next cycle (the so-called Hall of Fame). 55 All those choices are dictated by the high cost of evaluating the fitness of a new structure by constrained geometry optimizations. As a consequence, high fitness structures are worth being preserved in the population until some significantly improved structure is found. Typical values of the initial population, maximum

        <p>At the end of the whole exploration, low-energy conformers within a predefined energy range are selected from the panel of structures issued from IM-EA and, possibly, knowledge-based steps by eliminating too similar structures (in terms of rotational constants and root-mean-square deviations of heavy atom positions) and then performing single point energy evaluations at the B3LYP/jun-cc-pVDZ level, 56,57 also including Grimme's D3BJ dispersion corrections. 58 In the following, this computational model will be referred to simply as B3. The choice of the specific functional is not critical in this step because it is used only for the selection of an initial panel of structures to be next refined at higher levels. The B3 model has been selected because it is routinely employed in the interpretation of MW studies and, more importantly, provides reasonable anharmonic corrections (vide infra).At the end of the whole exploration, low-energy conformers within a predefined energy range are selected from the panel of structures issued from IM-EA and, possibly, knowledge-based steps by eliminating too similar structures (in terms of rotational constants and root-mean-square deviations of heavy atom positions) and then performing single point energy evaluations at the B3LYP/jun-cc-pVDZ level, 56,57 also including Grimme's D3BJ dispersion corrections. 58 In the following, this computational model will be referred to simply as B3.

        <p>In the next step, structures lying within a smaller energy range are optimized at the same level, and the surviving ones define the panel of candidates for the final structural refinement, which is performed employing the revDSD-PBEP86-D3BJ/jun-cc-pv(T+d)Z model [59][60][61] (hereafter rDSD) for both geometry optimization and evaluation of harmonic force fields. 62 The rDSD functional has been selected because several studies have shown that it provides excellent geometrical structures, 38 dipole moments, 63 spectroscopic parameters, 37 noncovalent intermolecular interactions, 23,64 and conformational landscapes. 10,65,66 This composite strategy allows for strongly reducing the number of expensive geometry optimizations by hybrid and, especially, double-hybrid functionals without any loss of accuracy in the final results. The different energy thresholds depend on the system and the spectroscopic technique of interest. For the specific case of rotational spectroscopy, a conservative limit for the relative stability of detectable conformers is around 900 cm -1 (which corresponds to a relative population of about 1% at room temperature, where kT/hc = 207 cm -1 ). 1,16 As a consequence, the typical thresholds for the acceptance of semiempirical structures, B3 geometry optimizations, and final rDSD refinement are 2500, 1500, and 1000 cm -1 , respectively. These choices lead to about 100 B3 computations (including both single point and geometry optimizations) and no more than 20 rDSD geometry optimizations for each molecular system.In the next step, structures lying within a smaller energy range are optimized at the same level, and the surviving ones define the panel of candidates for the final structural refinement, which is performed employing the revDSD-PBEP86-D3BJ/jun-cc-pv(T+d)Z model [59][60][61] (hereafter rDSD) for both geometry optimization and evaluation of harmonic force fields. 62 The rDSD functional has been selected because several studies have shown that it provides excellent geometrical structures, 38 dipole moments, 63 spectroscopic parameters, 37 noncovalent intermolecular interactions, 23,64 and conformational landscapes. 10,65,66 This composite strategy allows for strongly reducing the number of expensive geometry optimizations by hybrid and, especially, double-hybrid functionals without any loss of accuracy in the final results.

        <p>As mentioned in the Introduction, conformational relaxation can take place under the experimental conditions whenever the energy barriers ruling the interconversion are sufficiently low, with an upper limit of about 400 cm -1 being usually employed for discriminating in rotational spectroscopy of amino acids and related compounds. 6,7,67 With the aim of unraveling fast conformational relaxations, we always perform relaxed torsional scans at the rDSD level in order to obtain preliminary information on low-energy interconversion paths. Next, after precise location of transition states (TSs) by full geometry optimizations, their nature is checked by computing Hessian matrices.As mentioned in the Introduction, conformational relaxation can take place under the experimental conditions whenever the energy barriers ruling the interconversion are sufficiently low, with an upper limit of about 400 cm -1 being usually employed for discriminating in rotational spectroscopy of amino acids and related compounds. 6,7,67 With the aim of unraveling fast conformational relaxations, we always perform relaxed torsional scans at the rDSD level in order to obtain preliminary information on low-energy interconversion paths.

        <p>The typical MUEs of rDSD bond lengths (0.003 Å) and valence angles (0.003 radians, i.e., 0.15°) observed in the large SE100 database 38 are largely sufficient to obtain accurate relative electronic energies of different conformers by singlepoint energy evaluations using composite methods rooted in the coupled cluster (CC) ansatz. 68 In particular, the CC model including single, double, and perturbative estimate of triple excitations (CCSD(T)) 69 is considered the gold standard for this kind of computations provided that complete basis set (CBS) extrapolation and core valence (CV) correlation are taken into the proper account.

Furthermore, comparison with the most accurate results available for a panel of representative noncovalent complexes provided an average absolute error smaller than 10 cm -1 . 22,23 To determine the relative stability of different low-energy minima, one has to move from electronic energy differences to the corresponding relative enthalpies at 0K (ΔH 0 °) or free energies (ΔG°) at a temperature depending on the experimental conditions.

        <p>The first issue is solved in the present work by estimating anharmonic contributions in the framework of second order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2), which provides analytical and resonance free expressions for the ZPEs. 79 Harmonic (rDSD) and anharmonic (B3) contributions are employed in this connection, since a recent benchmark study has shown that for semirigid molecules the average absolute error of zero point energies with respect to accurate experimental results is reduced from 53 to 17 cm -1 when going from the HO to the VPT2 anharmonic model. 80 The treatment of low frequency contributions (typically less than 100 cm -1 ) is more involved because different modes (e.g., torsions, inversions, etc.) need be identified, characterized, and treated by proper variational anharmonic computations. 36,81 In the same benchmark study mentioned above in connection with anharmonic ZPEs, 80 it has been shown that the simple one-dimensional hindered rotor model proposed by Ayala 82 in conjunction with the VPT2 model for the other vibrational modes leads to remarkably accurate vibrational entropies for both semirigid and flexible molecules for which accurate experimental results are available. In particular, an average absolute error of 3 cm -1 is obtained for the TΔS contribution to free energies at room temperature. In the present context, test computations showed that the unbiased detection of hindered rotations becomes ambiguous for some conformers, so that we prefer to resort to the much simpler and black-box quasi-harmonic (QH) approximation. 35,83 In the QH approach, below a given cutoff value, entropic terms are obtained from the free-rotor model, and a damping function is used to interpolate between free-rotor and harmonic oscillator expressions close to the cutoff frequency.The first issue is solved in the present work by estimating anharmonic contributions in the framework of second order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2), which provides analytical and resonance free expressions for the ZPEs. 79 Harmonic (rDSD) and anharmonic (B3) contributions are employed in this connection, since a recent benchmark study has shown that for semirigid molecules the average absolute error of zero point energies with respect to accurate experimental results is reduced from 53 to 17 cm -1 when going from the HO to the VPT2 anharmonic model. 80 The treatment of low frequency contributions (typically less than 100 cm -1 ) is more involved because different modes (e.g., torsions, inversions, etc.) need be identified, characterized, and treated by proper variational anharmonic computations. 36,81 In the same benchmark study mentioned above in connection with anharmonic ZPEs, 80 it has been shown that the simple one-dimensional hindered rotor model proposed by Ayala 82 in conjunction with the VPT2 model for the other vibrational modes leads to remarkably accurate vibrational entropies for both semirigid and flexible molecules for which accurate experimental results are available.

        <p>The leading terms of MW spectra are the rotational constants of the vibrational ground-state (B 0 i , where i refers to the inertial axes a, b, c), which include vibrational corrections (ΔB vib i ) in addition to equilibrium rotational constants (B e i ). 84 In the framework of the VPT2 approximation, 85 the ground-state rotational constants can be expressed as (1) where the α r 's are the vibration-rotation interaction constants and the sum runs over all r vibrational modes. Noted is that the evaluation of the α r 's implies anharmonic force field calculations and that the sum appearing in eq 1 (contrary to individual terms) does not involve any resonance issue at the VPT2 level (for details, see, e.g., refs 11, 86, 87). ΔB vib i being a small fraction of the corresponding B e i (typically 0.5%), 88 it can be determined at an affordable level of theory (B3 in the present context) without significantly affecting the accuracy of the resulting vibrational ground-state rotational constant. 11,89 At the same time, inclusion of vibrational corrections is not warranted if the errors on the computed rotational constants are not much lower than 1% (50 MHz for a constant of 5000 MHz). Therefore, equilibrium rotational constants require very accurate geometrical parameters, which can be obtained only with state-of-the-art composite methods incorporating high excitation orders in the correlation treatment. These methods are able to deliver errors on equilibrium rotational constants as low as 0.1% (5 MHz for a rotational constant of 5000 MHz). 90 The reduced cost junChSF12 composite method delivers typical relative errors of 0.2%, 11,80,91 which are still sufficient for the unequivocal prediction and assignment of different conformers in the MW spectra of flexible molecules. Higher relative errors (typically 0.4-0.5%) are obtained at the rDSD level. However, the systematic nature of the errors permits geometrical parameters to be obtained and, thus, equilibrium rotational constants, rivaling the accuracy of the jun-ChSF12 counterparts by the linear regression approach (LRA). In this model, the computed geometrical parameters (r comp ) are corrected for systematic errors by means of scaling factors (a) and offset values (b) depending on the nature of the involved atoms and determined once for ever from a large database of accurate semiexperimental (SE) equilibrium geometries: 38,92 (2)The leading terms of MW spectra are the rotational constants of the vibrational ground-state (B 0 i , where i refers to the inertial axes a, b, c), which include vibrational corrections (ΔB vib i ) in addition to equilibrium rotational constants (B e i ). 84 In the framework of the VPT2 approximation, 85 the ground-state rotational constants can be expressed as (1) where the α r 's are the vibration-rotation interaction constants and the sum runs over all r vibrational modes.

ΔB vib i being a small fraction of the corresponding B e i (typically 0.5%), 88 it can be determined at an affordable level of theory (B3 in the present context) without significantly affecting the accuracy of the resulting vibrational ground-state rotational constant. 11,89 At the same time, inclusion of vibrational corrections is not warranted if the errors on the computed rotational constants are not much lower than 1% (50 MHz for a constant of 5000 MHz). Therefore, equilibrium rotational constants require very accurate geometrical parameters, which can be obtained only with state-of-the-art composite methods incorporating high excitation orders in the correlation treatment. These methods are able to deliver errors on equilibrium rotational constants as low as 0.1% (5 MHz for a rotational constant of 5000 MHz). 90 The reduced cost junChSF12 composite method delivers typical relative errors of 0.2%, 11,80,91 which are still sufficient for the unequivocal prediction and assignment of different conformers in the MW spectra of flexible molecules. Higher relative errors (typically 0.4-0.5%) are obtained at the rDSD level. However, the systematic nature of the errors permits geometrical parameters to be obtained and, thus, equilibrium rotational constants, rivaling the accuracy of the jun-ChSF12 counterparts by the linear regression approach (LRA).

Noted is that the intrinsic accuracy of the rDSD model leads in most case to b = 0.0 together with very small a values for bond lengths and that, among valence angles, only OCO and HCH need be corrected. Several studies have confirmed that very accurate molecular structures can be obtained employing this approach (referred to in the following as rDSD-LRA). 16,38,92,93 Additional parameters of particular relevance for MW spectroscopy are the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (χ ii , i referring to the inertia axis a, b, or c). 94 Nuclear quadrupole coupling is the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus with nuclear spin I ≥ 1) and the electric gradient at the nucleus itself. 86 Since at least one 14 N quadrupolar nucleus is present in all amino acids, nuclear quadrupole coupling constants are important for accurate predictions of rotational spectra because they determine a splitting of the rotational transitions, which generates the socalled hypefine structure. Since a systematic study of rDSD quadrupole coupling constants has not yet been performed, the comparison with the experimental values for several conformers of different amino acids represents per se an interesting benchmark. We anticipate that vibrational effects on nuclear quadrupole coupling constants are usually smaller than the uncertainty affecting the computed equilibrium values, and thus they have not been considered in this work.The a and b values for different bonds and valence angles are taken from ref 38.

One might think that the same conformers should be detected for cysteine and serine. However, the strengths of the H-bonds possibly formed by the thiol group are weaker than those of its alcohol counterpart. Therefore, it is expected that the barriers separating low-lying conformers decrease and in some instances may even disappear.

        <p>While the reader is referred to studies of specific systems for more detailed analyses along these lines, 46,47,96,111,115 we point out that only the availability of accurate results including all the stereoelectronic and vibrational effects (like those reported in the present paper) can provide an unbiased reference for building more realistic models (e.g., force fields including non additive terms) for the study of flexible biomolecules.While the reader is referred to studies of specific systems for more detailed analyses along these lines, 46,47,96,111,115 we point out that only the availability of accurate results including all the stereoelectronic and vibrational effects (like those reported in the present paper) can provide an unbiased reference for building more realistic models (e.g., force fields including non additive terms) for the study of flexible biomolecules.</p>
        <p>In this paper, a general strategy aimed at the unbiased disentanglement of the conformational bath of flexible biomolecule building blocks in the gas phase has been further improved and validated for the specific case of representative natural α-amino acids. The use of curvilinear internal coordinates permits the separation between stiff and soft degrees of freedom. Then, effective exploration of the soft variables can be performed by purposely tailored evolutionary algorithms, whose fitness scores are obtained by constrained geometry optimizations of the stiff degrees of freedom employing a fast semiempirical method. Refinement of the energies and structures by a hybrid and then a last-generation double-hybrid functional allows very reliable results to be obtained minimizing the number of expensive computations. Application of the procedure to supersonic jet experiments requires also the location of transition states ruling the interconversion between pairs of adjacent energy minima and the identification of fast relaxation processes. Improved structures and relative energies are obtained by the rDSD-LRA approach and the junChSF12 composite method, respectively. Finally, the spectroscopic parameters of sufficiently populated conformers can be safely computed at the rDSD level.In this paper, a general strategy aimed at the unbiased disentanglement of the conformational bath of flexible biomolecule building blocks in the gas phase has been further improved and validated for the specific case of representative natural α-amino acids.
