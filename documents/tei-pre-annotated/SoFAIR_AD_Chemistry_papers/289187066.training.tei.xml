        <p>Molecular motors [1] allow the transformation of energy input at the molecular scale into directional motions and are thus envisioned to provide archetypal powering engines for future complex nanomachinery. [2] To date av ariety of molecular setups have been made available that deliver such powered directional motions, [1a-m] and first attempts have been made to transmit their motions at the molecular scale [3] or integrate them into larger structures to perform macroscopic work. [4] However,a tp resent, there is only limited knowledge about the actual amount of work that as ingle molecular motor can actively (against strain) perform, and thus critical information for the next leap in applicability is missing. [2b, 5] Ad ifferent yet related pressing issue is the question as to how the integration of amolecular motor unit into alarger structure can be achieved such that its directional motion is effectively translated into ap otential energy increase at remote sites.H ere we present am olecular machine setup 1 that allows for the first time the effective transmission of potential energy increases from ap owering motor unit onto ar emote receiver unit, which thus actively accelerates the motion of the latter (Figure 1). [6] We used an axially chiral biaryl as the receiver unit, which in its nontethered form (reference compound 2)u ndergoes slow and nondirectional atropisomerization rotation towards a1 :1 equilibrium of enantiomers (Figure 1a). Coupling of amolecular motor unit enables us to drive this atropisomerization unidirectionally away from equilibrium. In contrast to an earlier reported system [3a] we have now shifted the ratedetermining step of the machineso peration cycle from the motor helix inversion step to the atropisomerization of the remote biaryl (see the Supporting Information for ad irect comparison of both systems). As ar esult, the biaryl atropisomerization is not passively following motor operation anymore but represents an energy hurdle against which the motor has to work actively.Inmachine 1,arate acceleration of several orders of magnitude for the biaryl atropisomerization was achieved by action of the motor, overpowering the intrinsic barriers for the isolated biaryl rotation (i.e., in model system 2 shown in Figure 1b,c). With this molecular setup, critical design principles for advanced nanomachinery are unraveled, paving the way for the effective generation and precise transmission of potential energy at the smallest scales.Molecular motors [1] allow the transformation of energy input at the molecular scale into directional motions and are thus envisioned to provide archetypal powering engines for future complex nanomachinery.

        <p>Molecular setup 1 incorporates am olecular motor unit that is based on the parent hemithioindigo (HTI) dye [7] (Figure 1). HTI belongs to the class of indigoid chromophores, [8] which are currently emerging as highly promising visible-light-responsive photoswitches. [9] Them otor unit is connected covalently to ar emote biaryl axis similar to an earlier described system that first evidenced the transmission of directional rotation from am olecular motor to adifferent molecular entity. [3a] In the herein presented setup 1,asterically strongly encumbered biaryl axis is introduced, which does not move in concert with the motor rotation. Different to the earlier four-state system that is governed only by the motor rotation steps,additional steps are introduced giving rise to an overall unidirectional six-step system (Figure 2). Thes ix isomeric states are termed A T for the tense state of A, A R for the relaxed state of A,a nd correspondingly B R , C T , C R ,a nd D R for simplicity;their exact stereochemical assignments are given in Figure 1a nd 2. Five of these steps can be observed directly experimentally,w hich also unequivocally confirms the existence of the sixth step and thus full directionality for the whole coupled 3608 8 rotation of both the motor and the biaryl unit.Molecular setup 1 incorporates am olecular motor unit that is based on the parent hemithioindigo (HTI) dye [7] (Figure 1).

        <p>As A R /A T and C R could be separated by HPLC,t heir behavior upon heating and irradiation at different temperatures could be scrutinized independently.U pon heating asolution of racemic C R in (CDCl 2 ) 2 to 80 8 8Cand up to 140 8 8C, the more stable A R was formed in up to 93 %. This establishes af ree enthalpy difference of DG = 1.7 kcal mol À1 in this temperature range between these two states.The corresponding kinetic analysis revealed ah igh energy barrier of 28.4 kcal mol À1 at 80 8 8Ca ccompanying the thermal Z/E double bond isomerization. Upon cooling pure C R down to À105 8 8Ci nC D 2 Cl 2 /CS 2 (4:1) and in situ irradiating the solution with 450 nm light at this temperature,anew set of [11] signals emerged, which is different to the known signal set of A R and A T (Figure 3e).

The D R isomer signals decay to 75 %w ithin 28 min at À80 8 8Ci nt he dark while at the same time only the signals of the A T isomer are growing to the same extent (Figure 3e). Again athermal equilibrium between D R (12 %remaining) and A T (88 %) is observed at À60 8 8C, which translates into af ree enthalpy difference of DG = 0.84 kcal mol À1 between the two states.Kinetic analysis of the thermal decay revealed an accompanying free activation enthalpy of D °G = 13.9 kcal mol À1 at À80 8 8Cf or this process.A tÀ40 to 0 8 8C, decay of the A T signals and concomitant growth of the known signals of A R was observed until their equilibrium was reached (see the Supporting Information). Kinetic analysis of this process gave an associated free activation enthalpy of D °G = 18.4-19.3 kcal mol À1 at À40 to 0 8 8C. Thus it was established that irradiation of pure Z-configured C R leads to af irst photoisomerization product D R ,w hich thermally converts into the A T isomer through asole helix inversion at the motor unit.

        <p>At À80 8 8C, the signals of B R /C T decay almost completely in the dark while at the same time only the signals of C R are growing to the same extent (Figure 3f). This gives al ower limit for the energy difference between C T and C R of 0.98 kcal mol À1 at this temperature under the conservative assumption that 5% residual B R /C T are not detectable by NMR spectroscopy.K inetic analysis gave af ree activation enthalpy of D °G = 13.4-13.7 kcal mol À1 for the conversion of C T into C R at À100 to À75 8 8C. Compared to the corresponding atropisomerization reaction of A T to A R (D °G = 18.4 kcal mol À1 at À40 8 8C), the atropisomerization activation energy for the C T into C R conversion is significantly reduced. This experimental result can in part be attributed to the stronger strain in C T than in A T ,w hich is clearly evidenced by the presence of at hermal equilibrium between A R and A T while such an equilibrium is not present between C R and C T .A s aconsequence, C T lies considerably higher in energy than A T , but probably not high enough to account for the full effect. Therefore,a lso the transition state for C T into C R conversion must be significantly stabilized by the tether strain. Thel arger strain in C T versus A T can be structurally explained by the larger distance between the two phenolic oxygen atoms serving as attachment points of the linker chain in the C structures as opposed to the A structures.I nt he crystalline state of C R ,t he distance between these two oxygen atoms is 10.6 whereas in A R the distance is only 7.6 ,a nd as imilar distance difference is seen in the theoretical description of the C T and A T states. This gives the linker chain greater conformational freedom in the A structures than in the C structures.G iven the free activation enthalpy for the thermal conversion of C T into C R ,t his process can be completely halted at À105 8 8C. It can thus be tested at À105 8 8C whether C T is strongly accumulated by light irradiation of A R . This should be possible if 1) the energy difference between B R and C T is exceeding 2.0 kcal mol À1 prohibiting as ignificant thermal equilibrium between the two states and 2) C T does not undergo productive photochemistry by itself.S uch an accumulation was indeed observed in the analogous experiment for A T when irradiating pure C R at À60 8 8C.

Them ost likely explanation in this case is in fact af ast thermal equilibrium between C T and B R enabling the establishment of aphotostationary state that includes photoreactions between B R and A R .A nother indication for the presence of as ignificant B R /C T equilibrium is the particularly strong temperature dependence of the corresponding NMR signals as opposed to 3) after 55 min of 450 nm irradiation at À105 8 8C; 4) after warming to À80 8 8Ci nthe dark;5)after 23 min at À80 8 8Cinthe dark. f) 1 HNMR spectra (400 MHz, CD 2 Cl 2 /CS 2 4:1) recorded for 1) pure A R at À105 8 8C; 2) after 5min of 450 nm irradiation at À105 8 8C; 3) after 34 min of 450 nm irradiation at À105 8 8C; 4) after warming to À80 8 8Ci nthe dark;5)after 28 min at À80 8 8Ci nthe dark.At À80 8 8C, the signals of B R /C T decay almost completely in the dark while at the same time only the signals of C R are growing to the same extent (Figure 3f).

        <p>Taken together,t he above-described measurements establish ac omprehensive mechanistic picture for the six-step transmission of unidirectional rotation in 1 (Figure 2a nd Figure 4).

Thec orresponding DH, DS, D °H,a nd D °S values are reported in the Supporting Information and allow us to extrapolate free enthalpies and kinetics to different temperatures.I nc ontrast to the usual four-step mechanism of the employed HTI motor unit, two more steps are introduced during one full 3608 8 rotation, which represent the potential energy increase that is transmitted from the motor to the biaryl unit. In these steps,the tethered biaryl unit is spring-loaded by the energetically downhill process of the motorsh elix inversion (Figures 4b and5). As ac onsequence the biaryl atropisomers are not energetically nearly degenerate anymore as it is the case for the non-tethered system 2 (Figure 5a,b;a lso see the Supporting Information for the determination of degeneracy).

        <p>As ar esult of the action of the motor unit, the energy barriers for the thermal biaryl atropisomerization are significantly reduced leading to asizeable rate enhancement for this process.T oo btain the intrinsic barriers of the untethered biaryl unit, model system 2 was synthesized and experimentally scrutinized in combination with at heoretical description capturing the two transition states associated with either clockwise or counterclockwise rotation in both the Z and the E isomeric state (for details see the Supporting Information). Thecorresponding D °G values were found to be 20.74 kcal mol À1 for the experimentally observed atropisomerization of (Z)-2 at 0 8 8C, which is close to the theoretical description giving 23.6 to 23.8 kcal mol À1 for (Z)-2,a nd 23.4 kcal mol À1 for (E)-2 as shown in Figure 5. As expected, clockwise and counterclockwise atropisomerizations of 2 do not encounter significantly different energy barriers,a nd the energy differences between atropisomer minima are very small with DG = 0.1 kcal mol À1 for both the Z and E isomers.T he atropisomerization barriers are thus lowered by up to 6.0 kcal mol À1 (C T to C R transition versus (Z)-2 atropisomerization;values were extrapolated to 0 8 8Cfor the former and measured at 0 8 8Cfor the latter) by the action of the molecular motor.As ar esult of the action of the motor unit, the energy barriers for the thermal biaryl atropisomerization are significantly reduced leading to asizeable rate enhancement for this process.T oo btain the intrinsic barriers of the untethered biaryl unit, model system 2 was synthesized and experimentally scrutinized in combination with at heoretical description capturing the two transition states associated with either clockwise or counterclockwise rotation in both the Z and the E isomeric state (for details see the Supporting Information).

        <p>From these results,important design principles to increase the performance of such integrated molecular machines can be derived. It seems evident that the length of the tether connecting the motor and biaryl units provides an efficient means of changing the effectiveness of energy transmission. It is thus straightforward to assume that amore rigid or shorter tether will enable more of the potential energies of the B R and D R states to be harnessed by increasing the energies of the A T and C T states.A sb oth the B R and D R states possess relaxed tethers,itisless likely that their energies would also be raised significantly by more rigid or shorter tethering.Inthis regard, our system behaves very differently from macrocyclic photoswitches that spring-load directly in the photoreaction. [10] In the latter cases,t ether lengths and rigidities have as trong influence on the energy of the metastable switching states initially populated after the photoreaction. In our case,i ti s theoretically possible to increase the energies of A T and C T beyond the energies of the initial photoproducts B R and D R .If the ground-state barriers between B R and D R and the starting states A R and C R remained considerably higher than all other barriers and the final states A R and C R still functioned as energy sinks,t he initial photoreactions would still be able to power completely unidirectional rotation of the system.From these results,important design principles to increase the performance of such integrated molecular machines can be derived.

        <p>In conclusion, we have presented am olecular machine setup enabling the transmission of the potential energy generated by am olecular motor unit onto ar emote biaryl receiver moiety.A saresult of the motor action, thermal atropisomerization of the biaryl is forced to proceed unidirectionally and at the same time is significantly accelerated by several orders of magnitude in terms of rate constants. Tr ansmittance of potential energy happens during the thermally activated ratcheting steps within the rotation mechanism and were comprehensively quantified. Up to 72 %ofthe initial potential energy increase was found to be actually transmitted, which directly corresponds to the amount of work that the motor unit would be able to perform on the biaryl system. These findings therefore deliver an ovel method for translating the power generated by am olecular motor on the nanoscale,g ive unprecedented insight into the working mechanism of such integrated molecular machines, and allow measuring the potential energy usable in this system. Our study thus provides afirst quantitative answer to the long-standing question of how much work as ingle molecular motor can actually perform at the molecular scale. Finally,d ifferent isomeric states of this six-step molecular machine can be accumulated separately under different irradiation conditions,w hich is ah ighly desirable property for applications requiring multistate molecular switching. Harnessing the transmitted potential energy to actually perform work at the molecular scale will be the next big leap in this research line,and our current efforts are focused in this direction.In conclusion, we have presented am olecular machine setup enabling the transmission of the potential energy generated by am olecular motor unit onto ar emote biaryl receiver moiety.A saresult of the motor action, thermal atropisomerization of the biaryl is forced to proceed unidirectionally and at the same time is significantly accelerated by several orders of magnitude in terms of rate constants.
