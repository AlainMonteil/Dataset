        <p>Additive manufacturing or, as also called, threedimensional (3D) printing is considered as a game-changer in replacing traditional processing methods in numerous applications; yet, it has one intrinsic potential weakness related to bonding of layers formed during the printing process. Prior to finding solutions for improvement, a thorough quantitative understanding of the mechanical properties of the interface is needed. Here, a quantitative analysis of the nanomechanical properties in 3D printed photopolymers formed by digital light processing (DLP) stereolithography (SLA) is shown. Mapping of the contact Young's modulus across the layered structure is performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a submicrometer resolution. The peakforce quantitative nanomechanical mapping (PF-QNM) mode was employed in the AFM experiments. The layered specimens were obtained from an acrylate-based resin (PR48, Autodesk), containing also a light-absorbing dye. We observed local depressions with values up to 30% of the maximum stiffness at the interface between the consecutively deposited layers, indicating local depletion of molecular cross-link density. The thickness values of the interfacial layers were approximately 11 μm, which corresponds to ∼22% of the total layer thickness (50 μm). We attribute this to heterogeneities of the photopolymerization reaction, related to (1) atmospheric oxygen inhibition and (2) molecular diffusion across the interface. Additionally, a pronounced stiffness decay was observed across each individual layer with a skewed profile. This behavior was rationalized by a spatial variation of the polymer crosslink density related to the variations of light absorption within the layers. This is caused by the presence of light absorbers in the printed material, resulting in a spatial decay of light intensity during photopolymerization.Additive manufacturing or, as also called, threedimensional (3D) printing is considered as a game-changer in replacing traditional processing methods in numerous applications; yet, it has one intrinsic potential weakness related to bonding of layers formed during the printing process.

        <p>Three-dimensional printing (3D printing) of photopolymers by digital light processing (DLP) stereolithography (SLA) is a fast, precise, and relatively cheap manufacturing tool, which enables one to convert liquid polymer resins to multifunctional objects with complex, designed shapes. 1,2 The DLP-SLA technique involves layer-by-layer processing, in which the resin is light-irradiated and cured, thus allowing an object to be built without masks, molds, and heavy machining. [3][4][5] Microporous platforms with complex shapes and without using specific tools have been obtained, allowing for personalized scaffold manufacturing, e.g., for biomedical applications. 6 Many other examples for fabricating implants and devices for tissue engineering for replacement, repair, or regeneration of the human tissue, blood vessels, bones, and muscles (also as an alternative to transplantation) have been described. 1,[7][8][9] In addition, SLA is also the subject of distinguished attention in the manufacturing of sophisticated objects made of polymer composites, 10 conductive, 11,12 or magnetic 13 polymers, as well as porous constructs, where the elastic response of the material can be precisely controlled. 14,15 In DLP-SLA, the so-called bottom-up printing configuration is typically used 16,17 (Scheme 1). This process encompasses curing of the resin by subsequent discreet exposure flashes of light controlled by a projection system, typically consisting of micromirrors (digital mirror device). The light is then directed to the polymer resin through a window in the bottom of the vat holding the resin to be processed. The object under construction is being moved (utilizing programmed step heights to obtain the desired layer thickness) during processing. To prevent resin adherence to the light-transmitting window, a material, for instance, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), can be used for its manufacturing that has oxygen permeability that can contain higher amounts of dissolved gas and "reoxygenate" the bottom layer of the resin, thus ensuring partial cure in the bottom part of the solidified layer. During printing, no strong bonding can form between the object and the window, which enables the displacement of the article processed. 18 In essence, an oxygen-inhibited photopolymerization takes place at the bottom of the vat, which leads to a layered, inhomogeneous structure across the printed slices that are formed flash by flash. [19][20][21] An important variant of the bottom-up configuration includes the continues liquid interface production (CLIP) technology, where the access of oxygen through the bottom window is strictly controlled to allow continuous operation of the building platform, and thus speeds up the printing process. 22 The bottom-up configuration is frequently used, basically because it needs less material to fill up the resin-containing vat, thus enabling the design of relatively small printers. 1,16 However, the way an object is printed in the bottom-up configuration has some consequences, namely: (1) it incorporates structural heterogeneities in layers of the 3D printed polymers due to the stepwise build-up processing and (2) a light blocker (an absorbing dye) is usually introduced to control the light-penetration depth, D P . The D p value is defined as the depth at which the penetrating light intensity falls to 1/e of the maximal light intensity. 23,24 Together with the critical irradiation dosage required to initiate the photopolymerization, E c (usually in mJ/cm 2 ), both E c and D p are key parameters in the photopolymerization process and have constant values for individual resin compositions. 25,26 Knowing the values of E c and D p , one can determine the required optimum settings of the light irradiation dosage, E 0 , the cure depth, C d , and the step height, z, for each processing cycle. An expression that connects irradiation dosages and depths can be written as 27Three-dimensional printing (3D printing) of photopolymers by digital light processing (DLP) stereolithography (SLA) is a fast, precise, and relatively cheap manufacturing tool, which enables one to convert liquid polymer resins to multifunctional objects with complex, designed shapes. 1,2 The DLP-SLA technique involves layer-by-layer processing, in which the resin is light-irradiated and cured, thus allowing an object to be built without masks, molds, and heavy machining.

        <p>The value of C d is associated with the gel point for the photopolymerized resin and thus with the formation of a threedimensional network providing shape stability. 1,24 Considering the properties of the 3D printed objects, one must target high bonding strength between the layers. This necessitates the use of layers with sufficient depth, i.e., C d &gt; z, because the stiffness of a polymer at the gel point is too low to endure the printing process. 28 However, the scenario when C d ≫ z should not occur to retain the designed architecture by remaining space-filling features uncured, for example, porous inclusions. 1,2,26 Additionally, if C d ≳ z, printing failure may occur due to poor attachment of the sequentially printed layers.The value of C d is associated with the gel point for the photopolymerized resin and thus with the formation of a threedimensional network providing shape stability. 1,24 Considering the properties of the 3D printed objects, one must target high bonding strength between the layers.

        <p>Stiffness (modulus of elasticity) of the interface between the consecutively printed layers is an important parameter in applications of 3D printed objects. 19,21 Hence, achieving good interlayer joints that provide decent dimensional stability during use is the focus of great interest. 1,19 If further progress is to be made in this manufacturing field, then the interfacial layers, including their mechanical performance, must be quantitatively characterized to allow one to optimize processing under the best attainable stereolithographic performance. 3,5,17,29 Unfortunately, a detailed quantitative characterization of the mechanical property profiles, particularly at the interface, is still in its infancy due to the limited availability of experimental methods and tools that can be used in situ. Initial work by Hofstetter et al. employed a combination of a rheometer, a UV curing system, and a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) to measure the double-bond conversion and the storage modulus simultaneously at the time of curing at the middle section of the individual layers formed (testing depth: 100 μm, cure depth: 200 μm). 23 Although this method shows great potential in local (within a plane at given layer depths) and averaged (macroscopic plate in the rheometer) mechanical characterizations, it cannot provide elastic modulus profiles across printed polymer objects at the nano-and micrometer length scales. Very recently, Yin and co-workers proposed orthogonal programming of the matrix stiffness and geometry via controlled oxygen inhibition-assisted stereolithography. 30 The effect of the inhibitors on the surface stiffness profiles during the polymerization was analyzed, among others, by atomic force microscopy (AFM) utilizing colloidal probes of 10 μm polystyrene spheres attached to a cantilever. This study shows that the variation in the cross-linking density can be analyzed by quantitative AFM imaging. We expect that AFMassisted quantitative mechanical characterization would provide novel information on the mechanical performance of the bridging layer, would yield an understanding of the layerforming photopolymerization process, and elucidate the molecular-level characteristics of the features at the interface as well if performed with sufficiently high resolution.Stiffness (modulus of elasticity) of the interface between the consecutively printed layers is an important parameter in applications of 3D printed objects. 19,21 Hence, achieving good interlayer joints that provide decent dimensional stability during use is the focus of great interest. 1,19 If further progress is to be made in this manufacturing field, then the interfacial layers, including their mechanical performance, must be quantitatively characterized to allow one to optimize processing under the best attainable stereolithographic performance. 3,5,17,29 Unfortunately, a detailed quantitative characterization of the mechanical property profiles, particularly at the interface, is still in its infancy due to the limited availability of experimental methods and tools that can be used in situ.

        <p>2.1. 3D Printing. Specimens were printed using an Autodesk Ember 3D printer, which employs a 405 nm light source, in a bottomup configuration (see Scheme 1). The resin employed (PR48, Scheme 1. Schematic Representation of Layer-by-Layer Photopolymer Printing in the Bottom-Up Configuration Autodesk) was placed on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-covered glass tray (with a PDMS thickness of 2 mm) and cured layer by layer. The light intensity used was 18 mW/cm 2 with an exposure time of 2.2 s for each layer; thus, the light irradiation dosage, E 0 , was 39.6 mJ/cm 2 per one layer. The E c and D p values were 6.3 mJ/cm 2 and 53 μm, respectively. 25 Thus, based on eq 1, the cure depth, C d , had a value of 97 μm. The programmed thickness of layers was 50 μm (the chosen build platform step value, z); thus, the manufacturing of consecutive layers occurred not only below the C d value but also slightly below the D p distance. The shape of the samples was designed by a commercial surface modeling software

        <p>The peakforce quantitative nanomechanical mapping (PF-QNM) mode was used to quantitatively determine the surface distribution of Young's modulus, dissipated energy, and adhesion forces using cantilevers with nominal spring constants of 42 N/m and a nominal tip apex radius of 8 nm (model NCH, NanoWorld, Switzerland). 31 The PF-QNM mode enables capturing images essentially in the absence of lateral (shear) forces. The right choice of cantilever stiffness values was relevant to detect and capture both the cantilever deflection and the sample surface deformation to quantitatively determine the values of Young's modulus and dissipated energy at each imaging pixel during raster scanning. The sensitivity of the AFM optical system was measured on silicon wafers as a rigid reference. Prior to sensitivity determination, the silicon wafers were ultrasonicated for 10 min in an acetone bath to remove particles and then treated by Piranha solution (20 min) to remove organic residues. The cantilever spring constant was determined by the thermal tune method. 32,33 Values ranging from 26.3 to 30.5 N/m were obtained. Young's modulus, dissipated energy, and adhesion force mapping were obtained by processing and evaluating force-distance curves collected pixel by pixel (256 pixels in 256 lines) following a sine-wave sample-tip trajectory with a frequency of 2 kHz and a peak-force amplitude value of 150 nm. The ScanAsyst panel was set to "individual" and then controlled by the AFM operator to minimize the influence of software auto-optimization (the feedback gain, the scan rate, and the z-scale range) on the data collected. Imaging settings were kept constant during one particular experiment. The typical feedback gain and peak-force setpoint values ranged between 20-25 and 50-500 nN, respectively. The raster scanning was made slow, i.e., the tip was raster scanned (while vibrating) over the sample surface at speeds less than 10 μm/s with the z-scale fixed at 5.6 μm.The peakforce quantitative nanomechanical mapping (PF-QNM) mode was used to quantitatively determine the surface distribution of Young's modulus, dissipated energy, and adhesion forces using cantilevers with nominal spring constants of 42 N/m and a nominal tip apex radius of 8 nm (model NCH, NanoWorld, Switzerland). 31 The PF-QNM mode enables capturing images essentially in the absence of lateral (shear) forces.

        <p>Two approaches, including the Derjaguin, Muller, and Toporov (DMT) model of contact mechanics and the "relative modulus determination method," were employed to quantify the surface stiffness. [34][35][36] As a reference, we used polystyrene (PS; Aldrich, M w ∼ 280 kg/mol) thin films. Reference samples were prepared by spincoating (2000 rpm) of PS solutions (20 wt %, diluted in toluene) on Piranha-cleaned silicon wafer supports. For calibration, Young's modulus value of PS was set at 2.7 GPa. 37,38 The calibrated AFM is then used for imaging samples with unknown Young's moduli. Scanning of the samples was conducted at similar indentation depths to keep the tip-sample contact area constant. The adhesion force was calculated as a difference between the baseline (no force acting part of the force-distance curve) and the snap-off point (the minimal point in the force-distance curve). The dissipated energy was determined by integrating the area between the "approach" and "withdrawal" sections of the force-distance curves. Corresponding dissipated energy values address the energy required to withdraw the tip from the surface (work of adhesion) as well as the energy that is lost during nonelastic deformations (e.g., viscoelasticity) when contact is established and broken.Two approaches, including the Derjaguin, Muller, and Toporov (DMT) model of contact mechanics and the "relative modulus determination method," were employed to quantify the surface stiffness.

        <p>For the discussion, we divided the areas in the AFM images (Figure 1d-f) into three regions, R1, R2, and R3, encompassing domains of different mechanical properties. The R1 and R3 regions define the interface formed in consecutive layer printing, being a part of the layer (n) and a part of the layer (n + 1), as indicated in Figure 1d,f. The step height, z, of the printed object is associated with the R1/R3 borderline. Simply, this is a geometrical boundary where the layer (n) starts to be cured, whereas the layer (n + 1) is attached to it, when curing of the layer (n + 1) is completed.For the discussion, we divided the areas in the AFM images (Figure 1d-f) into three regions, R1, R2, and R3, encompassing domains of different mechanical properties.

        <p>In all images, the interface is clearly visible, manifested by nearly vertical stripes with an intense, contrasted color. The height profile (cross-section plot in Figure 1d) shows a depression up to ∼150 nm at the interface. The uneven cross section arises from the way samples are prepared during cryofracturing. A heterogeneous stress distribution is generated arising from the dissimilar thermal expansion of the layers with different cross-link density (thus different stiffness) values. Once the sample was brought to room temperature after cryofracturing, stress is released, which results in the observed cross-sectional profile.In all images, the interface is clearly visible, manifested by nearly vertical stripes with an intense, contrasted color.

Once the sample was brought to room temperature after cryofracturing, stress is released, which results in the observed cross-sectional profile.</p>

        <p>In the Young's modulus map, the regions reveal a characteristic trend of the elasticity, i.e., R1a moderate increase, R2a smooth decay, and R3a moderate decrease. For the subsequent discussion, let us first focus on the R1 region, which is light-illuminated in the printing process as first. Although the samples were printed in the bottom-up configuration, where the access of atmospheric oxygen is much limited compared to the top-down configuration, the PDMScontaining vat widow (in the printer used) is a noticeable source of oxygen. 40,41 Prior to printing, PDMS is saturated with oxygen according to its solubility. Thereafter, the PDMS serves an oxygen reservoir that can pump the oxygen into a resin. The concentration of the oxygen in the 2 mm-thick PDMS is high enough to prevent printed layers from being stacked to the window. Zhao et al. have shown that the oxygen concentration at the PDMS surface, [O 2 ] 0 , can be as high as 1 mM. 19 During printing, when dissolved oxygen is being consumed, PDMS is "reoxygenated" through the diffusion of oxygen from the resin into the window. The printing process is slow enough (approx. 10 seconds from one layer to another; approx. 2.5 h for a sample) for the oxygen molecules from the resin to be diffused in the PDMS (the oxygen diffusion coefficient is 3.4 × 10 -9 m 2 /s). 19,42 This means that the oxygen in the PDMS can be refilled efficiently during the layer printing time. As a result, inhibited photopolymerization leads to an undercured and tacky surface of the printed layer. 18,43 This feature is actually beneficial for the interfacial bridging of layerto-layer structures, and thus for the building process, because a defined layer provides tacky lubrication to a next layer.In the Young's modulus map, the regions reveal a characteristic trend of the elasticity, i.e., R1a moderate increase, R2a smooth decay, and R3a moderate decrease.

        <p>Inhibited photopolymerization takes place in a defined space of the layer. The size effects in photopolymers, where the inhibited photocuring occurs, have been of scientific interest both in experiments and in modeling studies. 19,20,30,44,45 For instance, O'Brien and Bowman modeled a system of 50-μmthick diacrylate-based cured films that were exposed to oxygen (at [O 2 ] 0 = 1 mM) at the top surface. 20 They showed that the top 15 μm of the film revealed negligible double-bond conversion (below ∼ 0.1). Importantly, for further penetration into the film beyond the 15 μm of the thickness, the doublebond conversion showed a sharp transition as a function of the film depth to possess values above ∼0.6, resulting in material solidification. 46 Similar results were shown recently by Yin et al. in the SLA manufacturing of diacrylate-based resin in an oxygen-controlled setup. 30 For instance, for the light irradiation dosage of 44 mJ/m 2 , the authors demonstrated that the value of the double-bond conversion drops from ∼0.4 to below ∼0.1 at the top 10 μm of the layer thickness. Also, these authors used a PDMS film as the source of oxygen ([O 2 ] 0 = 0.35 mM).Inhibited photopolymerization takes place in a defined space of the layer.

        <p>Within the R1 region, Young's modulus shows a moderate increase; thereafter, it gains a stable value on crossing the R1/ R2 borderline. We associate these features, observed in Young's modulus profile, with the inhibited photopolymerization that occurs in the initial part of the defined layer and estimated the R1 region thickness to be ∼8 μm, as indicated in the cross-section plot. One should realize also that Young's modulus analysis is conducted on a part of a sample that, in fact, received several light irradiation flashes. Practically, however, only two illumination shots were able to cure the R1 region, namely, the light irradiation dosage projected directly to the defined layer and the light irradiation dosage projected thereafter on the next layer. The third light irradiation dosage is rather not able to cure in R1 region, since the cure depth, C d , is 97 μm, whereas the layer thickness, z, is 50 μm. By the same token, regions R2 and R3 were also irradiated (effectively) twice.Within the R1 region, Young's modulus shows a moderate increase; thereafter, it gains a stable value on crossing the R1/ R2 borderline.

        <p>In the R2 region, Young's modulus decays smoothly across the layer (for the full layer thickness, see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The light irradiation intensity decays as it passes through the layer in which it is absorbed, leading to a variation in the curing effect (cross-linking density). 1,23 Across the length of the R2 region, i.e., ∼39 μm, Young's modulus decreases from ∼1.2 MPa (R1/R2 borderline) to ∼1.0 MPa (R2/R3 borderline), corresponding to ∼17%.In the R2 region, Young's modulus decays smoothly across the layer (for the full layer thickness, see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information).

        <p>The moderate decrease of Young's modulus observed in the R3 region is relevant for building the interfacial strength. The R3 region represents a "transition" zone between the highly cured R2 region and the R1 region that experienced "weaker" curing. Along the relatively low thickness (∼3 μm) of the R3 region, the modulus drops by about ∼25% (1.0-0.75 MPa) Young's modulus (color contrast encoded from 0.5 to 1.5 GPa) maps of the interface and its vicinity. The AFM cross sections are taken along the white lines and plotted below the maps; two profiles are smoothened (red curve) by the Savitzky-Golay method (points of window: 30, polynomial order: 2). 39 The areas in AFM images are divided into three regions: R1, R2, and R3. The R1 and R3 regions form the interface. The R1/R3 borderline (white, dashed) represents a geometrical boundary at which the layer (n) starts to be cured, as the first, and the layer (n + 1) is completed and attached to the layer (n), as the next.

        <p>(Figure 1f). After the light irradiation is completed, the platform built is withdrawn (and glided aside) from the PDMS surface to allow the resin to fill up space and flow underneath the solidified layer. When the resin is brought in contact with the layer, the unreacted double bonds of the layer can act as bridging sites (contribution to interfacial reactions). Moreover, the photoinitiator can also diffuse from the resin into the R1 region of the layer to further support its curing (acceleration of the double-bond conversion). 19 Once the next light illumination flash is provided, the previously and subsequently obtained layers form a stable junction with a stiffness gradient, as this can be observed in Young's modulus cross-section profile.(Figure 1f).

        <p>Figure 2 shows high-resolution Young's modulus and adhesion force maps collected near the softest point at the interface, and in the stiff, bulk layer part, respectively (locations A and B shown in Figure 1f). Both surfaces unveil similar features in stiffness and adherence maps. To ensure that the surface profile variation has a limited effect on the observed morphology and measured mechanical properties, we performed a cross-correlation analysis (Supporting Information). The similarities of the nanoscale morphology indicate that while there are quantitative differences in the modulus values in all regions (R1, R2, and R3) related to differences in illumination times and cross-link characteristics, the molecular structure of the cross-linked network essentially remains the same.Figure 2 shows high-resolution Young's modulus and adhesion force maps collected near the softest point at the interface, and in the stiff, bulk layer part, respectively (locations A and B shown in Figure 1f).

        <p>Three-dimensional printed photopolymer interfaces between consecutively prepared layers were studied by AFM PeakForce Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping from submicron to micrometer length scales. Cross-sectional maps of the Young's modulus values unveil variations in mechanical performance between successively printed layers, attributed to differences in network cross-link density. The interface reveals changes in the elastic properties originating from oxygen-inhibited photopolymerization and bridging between the consecutive layers. The samples show smooth variations between regions of different stiffness but with the same chemical composition. Our work presents additional insights in the field of 3D printing in the bottom-up configuration because it quantifies the loss of Young's modulus at the interface and its vicinity for objects obtained using optimum printing parameters. Our results provide a route to derive essential design parameters and show how interface performance should be quantitatively analyzed at the nanoscale to achieve better product performance. At this point, to improve the mechanical stability of the 3D printed objects, we would suggest to limit the oxygen concentration at the PDMS surface to reduce the width of the R1 region. We focused in this work on the relative differences in the contact elasticity across the interface. However, to improve the estimation of the values of Young's modulus, a standardized methodology in AFM quantitative imaging based on the SNAP protocol can also be considered. 47 ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * sı Supporting InformationThree-dimensional printed photopolymer interfaces between consecutively prepared layers were studied by AFM PeakForce Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping from submicron to micrometer length scales.
