        <p>The sorption of species from solution into and onto solids, surfaces, crystals, gels and other matrices, underpins the sequestering of waste and pollutants, the recovery of precious metals, heterogeneous catalysis, many forms of chemical and biological analysis and separation science, and numerous other technologies.

        <p>Building on theory, 27 the demonstration that energy 28,29 and information 17,55 ratchet mechanisms 4,10 can drive molecular systems away from equilibrium enabled the design of molecular motors 28,55 and pumps 17,29 . The molecular ratchet used in the present study is modified from a design 20 that drives small-molecule rotary motors or pumps in response to variations in pH, achieved either by sequential additions of acid and base or by discrete pulses of a single chemical fuel. In the new design the crown ether is reduced in size from dibenzo-30-crown-10 (DB30C10) to dibenzo-24-crown-8 (DB24C8), which model studies found substantially increased the threading efficacy of the pump. This requires a concomitant reduction in the thickness of the track the ring has to pass over when the internal and external barriers are open, leading to molecular ratchet design 1 (Fig. 2).Building on theory, 27 the demonstration that energy 28,29 and information 17,55 ratchet mechanisms 4,10 can drive molecular systems away from equilibrium enabled the design of molecular motors 28,55 and pumps 17,29 .

        <p>Under acidic conditions, DB24C8 can thread onto the axle of 1, passing the dynamically labile hydrazone barrier to bind to a dibenzylammonium unit. Raising the pH then simultaneously kinetically locks the hydrazone barrier in place, preventing dethreading, and deprotonates the dibenzylammonium group to form a weakly binding amine, raising the macrocycle to a high energy state on the axle (Fig. 2b). Under the basic conditions the disulfide barrier can exchange with free thiol in bulk solution. The macrocycle can therefore shuttle past the dynamically labile disulfide barrier to the triazolium site, which is a stronger binding site for the ring than the amine. 56 Switching back to acidic conditions then locks the disulfide barrier in place, trapping the crown ether in the triazolium compartment, whilst simultaneously triggering hydrazone exchange again. This causes a second macrocycle to be threaded from solution onto the reformed dibenzylammonium site, whilst retaining the first macrocycle that is locked in the compartment containing the triazolium group.Under acidic conditions, DB24C8 can thread onto the axle of 1, passing the dynamically labile hydrazone barrier to bind to a dibenzylammonium unit.

        <p>In order to isolate and characterise the individual steps of the pumping cycle, we first examined the operation of pump 1 in solution via the stepwise addition of acid and base (Fig. 2). Combining 1 and DB24C8 in CD3CN at room temperature results in no detectable change to the 1 H NMR resonances of either component, confirming that threading does not occur under neutral conditions. Addition of trifluoroacetic acid (CF3CO2H) and hydrazide 2 resulted in the rapid appearance of the hydrazone peak He of capped [2]rotaxane 3H + at 8.4 ppm. Quantitative threading onto the axle occurred over the period of one hour, evidenced by a downfield shift of H h and H i by ~1.0 ppm and an upfield shift of H f and H k by ~0.2 ppm (Fig. 3c). Formation of 3H + was confirmed by electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS; see Supplementary Information, Section 2.1). Subsequent addition of 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU) deprotonated the dibenzylammonium group of 3H + , affording [2]rotaxane 3. Addition of thiol 4 and disulfide 5 resulted in shuttling of the macrocycle past the now-dynamically-labile disulfide barrier to the triazolium group, forming [2]rotaxane 6 (Fig. 3d). The position of the macrocycle in 6 causes the 1 H NMR resonances of Hf, Hh, Hi and Hk to return to similar chemical shift values to those in 1, and the broadening of Ho and Hm. Under these conditions the threading-shuttling cycle took ~16 hours to complete. Repeating the addition of CF3CO2H then generated [3]rotaxane 7H + (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Information, Section 2.1), an out-of-equilibrium concentration of rings on the axle that is only possible through 1 acting as a molecular ratchet. Finally, a second addition of DBU to 7H + deprotonated the dibenzylammonium group, the barriers trapping both macrocycles of 7 in high-energy states on the axle (Fig. 2b, bottom potential energy diagram). ), CF3CO2H (6.0 equiv.), CD3CN, r.t., 1 h, then DBU (11 eq.), 65%.

Having used the sequential operation of 1 to isolate and characterise each intermediate in the mechanism of the ratchet, we next operated 1 with a single chemical fuel, trichloroacetic acid (CCl3CO2H), which decarboxylates in the presence of a catalytic base to generate chloroform and carbon dioxide as waste products. 20,35,37,38 A pulse of CCl3CO2H provides transient acidic conditions for a period of time that can be tuned, removing the need for stepwise addition of acid and base as basic conditions are restored upon full decarboxylation of the fuel 20 . Pleasingly, addition of a pulse of CCl 3 CO 2 H to a mixture of 1, DB24C8, 2, 4, 5 and triethylamine, in CD3CN led directly to 6. Application of a second pulse of CCl3CO2H then generated 7 (see Supplementary Information, Section 2.2).In order to isolate and characterise the individual steps of the pumping cycle, we first examined the operation of pump 1 in solution via the stepwise addition of acid and base (Fig. 2).

        <p>We next demonstrated that it is possible to release the macrocycles from 7 in a stepwise fashion. As the hydrazone and disulfide barriers are labile under orthogonal conditions, we could selectively remove either barrier leaving the other intact. The bulky hydrazone group of 7 was exchanged with the smaller methylhydrazine (Supplementary Information, Section 2.3). The resulting pseudo [3]rotaxane spontaneously dethreaded to the corresponding [2]rotaxane, with the remaining macrocycle still trapped by the disulfide barrier. Reductive cleavage by addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) then removed the disulfide barrier, dethreading the second macrocycle into the bulk solution (Supplementary Information, Section 2.3). These experiments demonstrated a protocol whereby molecular ratchet 1 could be used to pump from, and then sequentially release the substrate back into, solution.We next demonstrated that it is possible to release the macrocycles from 7 in a stepwise fashion.

        <p>Finally, we demonstrated the ability of immobilised molecular ratchets to pump substrates from the solution phase to the surface of polymer beads (Fig. 4). A derivative of 1 with a terminal alkyne in place of the 3,5-dimethoxyphenyl stopper was attached to azide-functionalised polystyrene beads by conventional copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click chemistry. 57 The formation of solid-phase pump 10 was monitored by Fourier-transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, using the decrease in the intensity of the azide band absorption peak at 2090 cm -1 (see Supplementary Information, Section 6). For beads with a diameter of 10 μm, ~8×10 10 molecular pumps are attached at the solvent-accessible surface of each bead, assuming a penetration depth of 0.5 μm. 39 To analyse the operation of the immobilised molecular pump, and to demonstrate that the bound substrate is isolated within discrete compartments, we employed crown ethers labelled with anthracene (8; fluorescent under excitation at 350 nm) or naphthalimide (9; fluorescent under excitation at 420 or 470 nm) tags detectable using fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy (Fig. 2a).Finally, we demonstrated the ability of immobilised molecular ratchets to pump substrates from the solution phase to the surface of polymer beads (Fig. 4).

        <p>The operation of 10 was carried out in analogous fashion to pump 1 (Fig. 4). The progress of the fuelled uptake if the crown ethers onto the beads was followed by fluorescence microscopy (see Supplementary Information, Section 4.1). Each stage of the pump operation was analysed by washing the beads with CH2Cl2 and CH3CN to remove residual macrocycle, followed by microscopy of a sample of beads on a glass surface (Fig. 4 shows fluorescence microscopy of beads from before and after each operation to illustrate the change in appearance of the beads after pumping). Initially the beads, 10, displayed only weak fluorescence when excited at either 350 nm or 470 nm (Fig. 4b and4c). No increase or change in fluorescence occurred after the beads were suspended in CH3CN with either 8 or 9, alongside 2, 4 or 5. However, 18 h after a single pulse of CCl3CO2H to beads of 10 in a 2.8 mM acetonitrile solution of 8, afforded 11 (the initial acidity promoting threading, followed by decarboxylation and the regeneration of the basic pH over 18 h), which displayed a four-fold increase in fluorescence intensity when excited with 350 nm UV light, indicative of the presence of 8 on the beads (Fig. 4b). Exhaustive washing of the beads did not decrease the fluorescence intensity, illustrating that 8 is, indeed, mechanically locked onto the axles of the molecular pumps immobilised on 11. Subjecting beads 11 to a second pulse of CCl3CO2H, this time in a 2.8 mM acetonitrile solution of 9, afforded 12. The successful pumping of 9 onto the beads was evidenced by a six-fold increase in fluorescence intensity (compared to 10 or 11) upon excitation at 470 nm (Fig. 4b). Crown ethers 8 and 9 could also be pumped onto the beads to form a different sequence isomer 40 on the molecular axles (Fig. 4c). Reversing the order of macrocycle pumping gave bead 13, which exhibited a six-fold increase in fluorescence intensity when excited with 470 nm light, and then bead 14, which had a two-fold increase in fluorescence intensity when excited with 350 nm light (Fig. 4c).The operation of 10 was carried out in analogous fashion to pump 1 (Fig. 4).

        <p>Beads of 12 and 14, which differ only in the sequence of the rings on the axle, 40 are effectively indistinguishable by fluorescence microscopy at all wavelengths (Fig. 4b cf. 4c). However, the sequence information stored in the beads by ratcheting to their out-of-equilibrium states can be revealed by successive release of the macrocycles from the different compartments of the axle (Fig. 5). Treatment of rotaxane-bead 12 with methylhydrazine followed by Et3N in acetonitrile, gave a supernatant solution which was analysed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Upon excitation at 420 nm (the wavelength of maximum absorption of the tag but unavailable with our fluorescence microscopy set up), the fluorescence emission centred at 520 nm is characteristic of macrocycle 9 (left hand spectrum, Fig. 5a). The resulting bead 15 was then treated with dithiothreitol (DTT; to cleave the disulfide barrier) liberating 8 into solution, as indicated by the characteristic fluorescence emission at 395 nm when excited with 350 nm UV light (right hand spectrum, Fig. 5a). Subjecting the sequence isomer rotaxane-bead 14 to the same cleavage protocols, the order of macrocycle release was reversed (Fig 5b). The energy input for life largely originates from light (via photosynthesis). However, biology uses chemical fuels 58 as the primary mediators of energy to power 59 the complex nonequilibrium nanotechnology of the cell. Here we have demonstrated that immobilised molecular ratchets can transduce energy from a chemical fuel for the non-equilibrium transport of substrates from one phase of matter to another. Such processes may prove useful for the extraction of chemicals from solution (or the gas phase) and the storage and release of both energy and information, by and for artificial molecular nanotechnology. 60Beads of 12 and 14, which differ only in the sequence of the rings on the axle, 40 are effectively indistinguishable by fluorescence microscopy at all wavelengths (Fig. 4b cf. 4c).
