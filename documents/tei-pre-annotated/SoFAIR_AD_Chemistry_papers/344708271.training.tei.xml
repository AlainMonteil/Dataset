        <p>A macromolecular gear composed by a helical polyphenylacetylene (PPA) framework with short oligopeptide helices as substituents on the phenyl rings is described where the two helices (framework and substituents) are coupled and respond to the action of external stimuli by inverting the P/M sense or modifying the elongation. This gear is obtained by polymerization of the acetylene group introduced at the C-terminus of a short oligopeptide formed by achiral Aib units (n=1-3) derivatized at the N-terminus by a single enantiomer (R or S) of a-methoxy-a-trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid, (MTPA, Mosher reagent). Thus, the chiral information of the MTPA is transmitted to the achiral Aib fragment and harvested by the polyene backbone, which adopt preferentially a P or M helical scaffold. Variations on solvent polarity produce in the case of (R)-MTPA-(Aib)1-PPA changes on the helical sense and elongation due to variation on the conformational composition of the MTPA and aib moieties. In the case of (R)-MTPA-(Aib)2-PPA and (R)-MTPA-(Aib)3-PPA, the presence of polar solvents produces changes on the achiral Aib fragment that affect to the elongation of the helical scaffold but maintaining a certain orientation that induces a screw sense excess in the polyene main chain.The process is fully reversible, being possible to control the elongation and helical sense of the helical polymer by acting on the macromolecular structure adopted by the (Aib)n-MTPA fragment.A macromolecular gear composed by a helical polyphenylacetylene (PPA) framework with short oligopeptide helices as substituents on the phenyl rings is described where the two helices (framework and substituents) are coupled and respond to the action of external stimuli by inverting the P/M sense or modifying the elongation.

        <p>Helical structures are structural motifs frequently observed in nature that are closely related to the function of molecules. Classical examples are the a-helix in peptides and proteins, the helices found in polysaccharides or the DNA double helix. [1] The dynamism of the helical motif is known to be essential for many important biological processes such as cell signaling, where the signals are produced by conformational changes in the transmembrane helices that form the G-protein coupled receptors. [2] This structure/function relationship is the main reason for the development during the last decades of new molecular systems folded into helical structures such as foldamers or helical polymers, which can act as new biomimetic functional materials.Helical structures are structural motifs frequently observed in nature that are closely related to the function of molecules.

        <p>In natural peptides or DNA, the presence of chiral monomers restricts the possibility of switching their helical sense due to the different stability of the two possible diastereomeric helices. 3 This problem can be surpassed using polymers or foldamers constructed by non-chiral units, which show a low energy barrier between the two (P/M) helical senses and therefore allowing the helical inversion by external stimuli. [3] For instance, a preferred helical sense can be induced in polymers made by achiral monomers, by using a chiral additive, [4] or by the classical Sergeants and Soldiers effect. [5] In the case of dynamic helical polymers made by chiral monomers, the helical sense enhancement [6] or inversion [7] can be induced by external stimuli (i.e. temperature, solvents, metal ions, etc.), which act on the conformational composition of the monomerrepeating unit. An alternative way is to introduce a small amount of a chiral dopant into the polymer sequence -chiral coalition [8] and chiral Sergeants and Soldiers effect [9] -, where the stereochemistry of the copolymer components determines the helical sense of the polymer chain. Peptidomimetics resort to oligomers formed by either non-natural amino acids or combinations of natural and non-natural amino acids that fold into helical structures -foldamers-mimicking natural peptides. [10] Achiral residues can be used as building blocks, and the selective induction of the P/M helical senses is achieved by linking (covalent or supramolecular interactions) a chiral amino acid at one of the two edges -N or C terminus. This phenomenon named as "domino effect" [11] was described by Inai in oligomers formed by a-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and a,bdidehydrophenylalanine. [11] Toniolo, [11] Yashima [12] and Clayden [13] have done a great contribution in this field studying the folding of oligopeptides constituted mainly by achiral Ach, Aib or Aib/glycine residues. In these oligopeptides, the screw sense induction is produced by a chiral amino acid placed at the N or Ctermini of the sequence, whose stereochemistry determines the helical sense adopted by the foldamer. [10]-[13] Additionally, changes on the foldamer screw sense can be also obtained by manipulation of the hydrogen bonds of the helical scaffold, or by using pH or photochemistry as external stimuli. As a result, frequently, the changes of helical sense of the oligopeptide requires either changes on the absolute configuration of the peptide or on the net number of atoms in the foldamer. . [10]-[13] In previous works, achiral spacers consisting on a glycine or diglycine fragment were used to explore chiral teleinduction in PPAs. In those systems it was found that by increasing the number of glycine residues from 1 to 2, the teleinduction decreases dramatically. ref Herein we want to demonstrate that it is possible to induce a screw sense preference in PPA using achiral spacers that follow other chiral information transmission mechanism, such as chiral information harvesting. Ref Thus, we will show that introduction of the (R)-or (S)-a-methoxya-trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid, (MTPA, Mosher reagent) at the N-terminus of an achiral Aib oligopeptide, will generate a twisted structure with a preferred orientation. [14] In addition, the introduction of a 4-ethynylaniline group at the C-2 terminus of these peptides, followed by polymerization of the alkyne group will produce the corresponding poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) [15] behaving as macromolecular gears. In these systems, the chiral MTPA residue is expected to induce a major P/M orientation in the achiral oligopeptide, which through a chiral information harvesting mechanism will result in the adoption of a preferred P/M screw sense in the polyene main chain. Moreover, changes in solvent polarity could produce modifications in the ensemble of the MTPA-(Aib)n conformations, which should be further transmitted to the PPA as changes on the elongation and/or sense of the helix.In natural peptides or DNA, the presence of chiral monomers restricts the possibility of switching their helical sense due to the different stability of the two possible diastereomeric helices. 3 This problem can be surpassed using polymers or foldamers constructed by non-chiral units, which show a low energy barrier between the two (P/M) helical senses and therefore allowing the helical inversion by external stimuli.

        <p>To create a macromolecular gear, it is necessary first to design and test its different components. Our gear was planned to be formed by a helically tunable polyphenylacetylene skeleton, with oligopeptides as pendant groups possessing a switchable scaffold (Figure 1). Both types of helices, the main chain (polyene) and those at the substituents (oligopeptide), should be dynamic and connected in such a way that when an external stimulus act on the oligopeptide, changes in the ensemble of oligopeptide conformations would trigger structural changes on the polyeneelongation and/or helical sense-through a chiral harvesting mechanism. As chiral harvesting promoters, we selected oligopeptides made by achiral Aib residues that are known to adopt twisted structures such as b-turn or 310 helices.ref Clayden In order to induce a biased screw sense, we introduced chiral a-methoxy-atrifluoromethylphenylacetic acid (MTPA), at the N-terminus. This chiral element was chosen because is known to respond to solvent polarity adopting different conformations and in fact, when MTPA was introduced as substituent on a PPA, those stimuli related conformational changes were strong enough to trigger changes in the polyenic helix. [16] Thus, we prepared three different H-(Aib)n-COOH oligomers (n= 1, 2, 3) capped at the N-terminus with the chiral (R)-MTPA unit and at the C-terminus with a 4-ethynilaniline [(R)-MTPA-(Aib)n-PA] (See SI for synthetic details). Experimental evidence was obtained showing that (R)-MTPA-(Aib)n-PA (n= 1, 2, 3) oligomers adopt twisted macromolecular structures from X-ray diffraction. Crystals of (R)-MTPA-(Aib)1-PA obtained from DCM/hexane solutions revealed the presence of an M twisted structure stabilized by the presence of an antiperiplanar conformation between the carbonyl and methoxy group of the (R)-MTPA residue (Figure 2a). In the case of the oligomer containing two Aib residues -(R)-MTPA-(Aib)2-PA-, X-ray diffraction showed three different twisted structures that resemble a b-turn. The three structures are stabilized by a intramolecular hydrogen bond between a i and i+3 residues (Figure 2b). These three different helical scaffolds show an antiperiplanar orientation between the carbonyl and methoxy groups of the (R)-MTPA residue, but while two show M orientations of the (Aib)2 spacer, the third one shows a P orientation (figure 2b). Pair fittings of those structures in the anilide region show that although the screw senses described by the spacer are different, the aromatic group of the MTPA is placed in similar spatial orientations related to the anilide group (Figure 2x and SI). Interestingly, in the case of (R)-MTPA-(Aib)3-PA, X-ray studies showed the coexistence in the same crystal unit of the two helical senses -P and M -that resemble 310 helices, stabilized by two consecutive i, i+3 hydrogen bonds (Figure 3c,d). In both helical structures, the P and M helical senses are defined by different conformations at the MTPA moiety: i) Antiperiplanar conformation between the carbonyl and methoxy groups (apOMe) associated to the right-handed twist (P) in the oligomer (Figure 2xx); ii) Antiperiplanar conformation between the carbonyl and the trifluoromethyl group (apCF3) responsible for the adoption of a lefthanded screw sense (M) (Figure 2xx). In all cases, the CD spectra were null as expected and UV-vis studies revealed a bathochromic shift of the polyene backbone when the polarity increased (See SI). This fact indicates that the interaction of the polar solvents with the Aib residues is the phenomenon responsible of the helical stretching observed in all Aib containing PPAs. Interestingly, although these Aib oligomer-polar solvent interactions affect the elongation of the PPAs, active CD spectra are still observed in some cases. This fact indicates that increasing solvent polarity produces changes in the ensemble of Aib oligomer conformations, including the presence of some unfolding states, the overall orientation of the achiral spacer -Aib Interestingly, the transmission to the polyene helix of the changes in the oligopeptide substituents, depends on the length of the oligopeptide. Thus, in the case of a polymer substituted by the shortest oligomer PPAs -(R)-MTPA-(Aib)n-PA (n= 1)-, a change in polarity inverts the helical sense of the oligopeptide substituents and that of the polyene skeleton that shows also an elongation of the chain probably to release the strain gained with the conformational change at the pendant (Figure 6a).To create a macromolecular gear, it is necessary first to design and test its different components.

        <p>In contrast, the polyene chain of the polymers containing two or three Aib residues as substituents, PPAs -(R)-MTPA-(Aib)n-PA (n= 2, 3)-, respond to the oligopeptide inversion just with elongation and without helical inversion. This is so probably because the energy penalty to accommodate the larger substituents (n= 2, 3) by inversion of the helix is much higher than by increasing the dihedral angle between conjugated double bonds (Figure 6a,b).In contrast, the polyene chain of the polymers containing two or three Aib residues as substituents, PPAs -(R)-MTPA-(Aib)n-PA (n= 2, 3)-, respond to the oligopeptide inversion just with elongation and without helical inversion.
