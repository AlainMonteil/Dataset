        <p>In recent years the advances in the intensity and resolution that can be achieved with synchrotron radiation has resulted in a surge in interest in spectroscopic techniques in the X-ray region. Exploiting spectroscopy involving core electrons has several advantages, the large energy difference between core orbitals of different elements and their spatially local nature results in the techniques being element specific. Furthermore, the lifetime of the core-hole states allows processes to be probed on an ultrafast timescale. Figure 1 illustrates four widely used X-ray spectroscopic techniques, namely X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nearedge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). XPS monitors the photoionised core-electrons and provides a sensitive probe of the chemical environment of the nuclei. X-ray absorption spectroscopy encompasses a range of techniques, but of particular relevance here is NEXAFS which corresponds to the spectroscopic structure around the absorption edge arising from the excitation of core electrons to low lying unoccupied orbitals to give bound states below the ionisation threshold. XES measures the emission following the ionisation of a core-electron as electrons in higher lying orbitals relax to fill the core-hole. XES is complementary to NEXAFS since it probes the occupied orbitals, while NEXAFS probes the unoccupied orbitals. In RIXS an incident X-ray photon is scattered by the core excited states leading to fluorescent decay and the emission of a photon.In recent years the advances in the intensity and resolution that can be achieved with synchrotron radiation has resulted in a surge in interest in spectroscopic techniques in the X-ray region.

        <p>The interpretation of X-ray spectra can be challenging and calculations often play a critical role in revealing the information contained within the spectra. There has been an intense effort towards developing quantum chemical based methods for the treatment of core-electron spectroscopies. These can be based on the many electron wavefunction such as complete active space self-consistent field with multiconfigurational perturbation theory, 1 coupled cluster [2][3][4][5] and the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) based method, 6,7 and a review of these methods is available elsewhere. 8 Our work has concentrated on the description of core-electron spectroscopies within the framework of density functional theory (DFT).

        <p>Alternative approaches to describing excited states within DFT are becoming increasing well established. One common strategy is to converge the DFT calculation to describe an excited state directly, 14 one example of this is the maximum overlap method (MOM) which uses an overlap criterion to maintain the excited state during the self-consistent field calculation and this approach has been applied to study core-excited states. 15 Calculations of X-ray spectroscopies can be performed using a variety of software packages, however, the calculations and developments discussed here use the 
            <rs type="software">Q-Chem</rs> software package. 16 Relativistic effects also become an important consideration for calculations of core-electron spectroscopies. For studies at the K-edge, these effects lead to a lowering of the energy of the 1s orbital, and this can be accounted for by applying a constant energy shift to the computed transition energies. For other edges, for example the L-edge, the effects of spin-orbit coupling become significant which necessitates a more sophisticated treatment.

        <p>X-ray absorption spectra contain two different regions, the region near the absorption edge which is described in NEXAFS spectroscopy and the region at higher energies which is referred to as extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). NEXAFS corresponds to formation of bound states below the ionisation threshold which can be described by TDDFT, whereas EXAFS arises from the scattering of the ionised electron and is not described by standard TDDFT approaches, but alternative methods for describing the EXAFS region are widely used. 17 It has been well established in the literature that core-excitation energies predicted by TDDFT with generalised gradient approximation (GGA) and hybrid functionals lead to a systematic underestimation of the experimentally observed values which increases as the nuclear charge of the absorbing atom increases. 18 The size of the error ranges from about 11 eV for the carbon K-edge to over 100 eV for the Cu K-edge for a hybrid functional such as B3LYP. One approach to this is to apply energy shifts to the calculated spectra. 19,20 We have been interested in understanding the origin of this error and designing exchangecorrelation functionals that reproduce experimental spectra without the need to apply an energy shift.X-ray absorption spectra contain two different regions, the region near the absorption edge which is described in NEXAFS spectroscopy and the region at higher energies which is referred to as extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS).

This is illustrated by the study of carbon nanostructures including fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. 43 Figure 5 shows the computed and experimental non-resonant X-ray emission spectra for C 60 and a model (9,0) nanotube. The simulated spectra are based upon a SRC1r1/6-31G* calculations and generated using equations 9 and 10. For both systems the calculations reproduce the shape of the experimental spectra well. Insight into the nature of the observed peaks can be obtained through decomposing the spectra into contributions from orbitals with π and σ character. The most intense bands in the spectrum of C 60 correspond to transitions from σ-type orbitals, while the high energy bands at 281.7 eV and 283.0 eV arise from π-type orbitals. For the nanotube the calculations show that peak A arises from σtype orbitals, while bands B and C correspond to orbitals of π character. It has also been</p>

        <p>This strategy of using a core-hole reference determinant is not limited to TDDFT calculations. This approach has also been exploited to study XES within ADC and EOM-CCSD formalisms. 7,46 This approach has been demonstrated to give accurate spectra for transition metal complexes [47][48][49] and has also been used to study the XES of liquid water. 50 The key feature in the X-ray emission spectrum of liquid water is the two peaks observed for the emission associated with the lone-pair (1b 1 ). The spectra were analysed in terms of the hydrogen bond configurations using a local structure index (LSI) combined with a geometrical H-bond cone criterion classification. This showed that tetrahedrally coordinated molecules characterized by high LSI values and two strong donated and two strong accepted hydrogen bonds contribute to the low energy 1b 1 emission peak while the high energy 1b 1 peak is associated with asymmetric hydrogen bond environments with one strong accepted hydrogen bond and one strong donated hydrogen bond and low LSI values. It was suggested that these extreme structures were under-represented in MD simulations. 50 Our recent work has focused on the simulation of X-ray emission spectra for organic molecules, exploring the influence of factors such as basis set and exchange-correlation functional on the computed spectra. 51 The degree of accuracy that can be achieved using this approach is illustrated in Figure 6 which shows a comparison between the computed B3LYP/cc-pCVQZ spectra and experiment for a range of molecules. The computed spectra provide an accurate description of the experimental spectra reproducing the peak heights and their relative energy spacing accurately. In some cases, for example ammonia and acetone, the relative intensities of the bands are predicted less well. However, for these spectra a uniform broadening has been applied and a single structure considered, and it has been shown 51 that incoporating nuclear dynamics can improve the calculated relative intensities of the bands. Similar to TDDFT calculations of X-ray absorption spectra, the use of approximate exchange-correlation functionals leads to a systematic error in the calculated transition energies. However, for XES the transition energies are too large in contrast with X-ray absorption where they are underestimated.This strategy of using a core-hole reference determinant is not limited to TDDFT calculations.

        <p>For X-ray absorption spectroscopy it has been possible to design exchange-correlation functionals that are able to predict the core-excitation energies that are in agreement with experiment without the need to apply an energy shift. We have found for standard hybrid functionals, approximately (66%) of HF exchange is required to give emission energies close to the experimental values. 44 However, a consequence of this focus on the transition energies is that quality of the computed spectra deteriorates, and similar problems were encountered for short-range corrected functionals. 44,51 One reason for this difficulty is that for XES the relevant core orbital is unoccupied, and as a result the properties of this orbital are only being influenced indirectly through orthogonalisation with respect to the occupied orbital space. It is possible to determine the energy shift that needs to be applied to the TDDFT computed spectra through an additional ∆SCF calculation, in a similar strategy that is often used for X-ray absorption spectra. 19,20 One approach is to evaluate the required energy shift from the energy difference between the highest energy transition in the TDDFT calculation and the corresponding transition energy from a ∆SCF (E core-ionised -E cation ) calculation. 51 Another factor that has emerged as important for TDDFT based calculations of XES is the quality of the basis set used. We have performed an extensive study of the performance of a wide range of basis sets for the calculation of core-electron spectroscopies. 32 This study reveals that calculations that involve the core-ionised state, which include the calculation of core-electron binding energies for XPS and TDDFT calculations of X-ray emission spectra, converge very slowly with respect to the size of the basis set. This particularly the case for studies at the K-edge of heavier nuclei. The reason for this poor convergence is that smaller basis sets provide a poor description of the core-ionised state since they do not contain basis functions necessary to describe the more compact electron density of the core-ionised state.For X-ray absorption spectroscopy it has been possible to design exchange-correlation functionals that are able to predict the core-excitation energies that are in agreement with experiment without the need to apply an energy shift.

        <p>We have proposed a simple strategy that can be applied to all commonly used gaussian basis sets, which provides relatively small basis sets which are able to capture the accuracy of much larger basis sets. 52 In this approach, core and valence (not polarisation) basis functions for the element with one higher nuclear charge are added to the basis set. This only needs to be done for element being core-ionised and adds only a few additional basis functions, the resulting basis sets are term (Z+1) basis sets, for example (Z+1)6-31G*. Alternative strategies include using values for the exponents that lie between the element and the element with a nuclear charge of one higher 53 and uncontracting basis functions. The sensitivity of computed X-ray emission spectra to basis sets is illustrated in Figure 7. There is a significant shift to higher energy for the 6-31G* basis set compared with the larger cc-pCVQZ basis set, and this shift is much larger for the chlorine K-edge compared with the oxygen K-edge. The (Z+1)6-31G* basis set is shown to reproduce the behaviour of the much larger basis set. This improvement is not just in terms of a shift in energy but also the computed spectral profile which for the (Z+1)6-31G* basis set closely resembles the larger basis set, while there is a significant variation for the 6-31G* basis set. This approach to augmenting basis sets is also important in the calculation of coreelectron binding energies in ∆SCF approaches for simulating XPS. Table 1 shows the computed binding energies for the oxygen and sulphur 1s electrons in H 2 O and H 2 S. The values for the cc-pCVQZ basis set are near the basis set limit and a large discrepancy from these values is observed for the 6-31G* basis set, particularly for H 2 S. However, when the 6-31G* set is augmented with basis functions according to the (Z+1) prescription the cc-pCVQZ core-electron binding energies are essentially reproduced. The valence-to-core (VtC) region of the X-ray emission spectra of transition metal complexes has attracted considerable attention. The study of these systems highlights further considerations that need to be taken into account when simulating X-ray spectra at the K-edge of heavier nuclei. This was illustrated in our recent study on the VtC X-ray emission spectroscopy of halozincate complexes. 54 RIXS is a rapidly developing technique that combines the element specific nature of X-ray spectroscopic techniques with the ability to probe different intermediate states. Furthermore, RIXS is not limited by the optical selection rules and is capable of probing the evolution of the electronic structure and nuclear dynamics of the intermediate state on an ultrafast timescale, see Figure 9, and the role of sections rules in RIXS has been highlighted in a recent study of benzene. 55 Gel'mukhanov and co-workers have reported a formalism for computing RIXS intensities based upon the Kramers-Heisenberg (KH) equation which accounts for channel interference and polarisation anisotropy effects. 56 In our calculations, this is achieved in a sum-over-states approach, however, alternative approaches based upon damped response theory have been developed. 55 The key quantities required to determine RIXS intensities are the transition energies and transition dipole moments of the excitation and emission processes, which means that simulation of RIXS maps requires both the excitation and emission processes to be described accurately.

        <p>RIXS data can be presented as a RIXS map where the intensity is plotted as a function of the excitation and emission energies. High quality experimental data is for the RIXS map of the water molecule is available, 57 and we have explored the simulation of the RIXS map based upon different quantum chemical methods including ADC and TDDFT. 58 The calculated RIXS maps based upon the TDDFT calculations are shown in Figure 10. The map based upon a single structure qualitatively reproduces the experimental data but many features evident in the experimental map are absent. To capture these features it is necessary to consider nuclear dynamics. The water molecule undergoes dissociation on the nanosecond timescale in the core-excited state and the effects of this are clearly evident in the RIXS map, ultrafast dissociation has also been observed recently for the water cation. 59 This can be captured in the simulations by sampling over structures taken from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the ground and core-excited intermediate states. To incorporate conformational sampling and channel interference, each ground state structure was linked to each of the excited state structures to give 3200 spectra of different coordinate combinations.RIXS data can be presented as a RIXS map where the intensity is plotted as a function of the excitation and emission energies.
