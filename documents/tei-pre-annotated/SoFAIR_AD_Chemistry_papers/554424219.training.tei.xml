        <p>The self-assembly and structural and functional properties of peptide conjugates containing bulky terminal aromatic substituents are reviewed with a particular focus on bioactivity. Terminal moieties include Fmoc [fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl], naphthalene, pyrene, naproxen, diimides of naphthalene or pyrene, and others. These provide a driving force for self-assembly due to π-stacking and hydrophobic interactions, in addition to the hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and other forces between short peptides. The balance of these interactions leads to a propensity to selfassembly, even for conjugates to single amino acids. The hybrid molecules often form hydrogels built from a network of β-sheet fibrils. The properties of these as biomaterials to support cell culture, or in the development of molecules that can assemble in cells (in response to cellular enzymes, or otherwise) with a range of fascinating bioactivities such as anticancer or antimicrobial activity, are highlighted. In addition, applications of hydrogels as slow-release drug delivery systems and in catalysis and other applications are discussed. The aromatic nature of the substituents also provides a diversity of interesting optoelectronic properties that have been demonstrated in the literature, and an overview of this is also provided. Also discussed are coassembly and enzyme-instructed self-assembly which enable precise tuning and (stimulusresponsive) functionalization of peptide nanostructures.The self-assembly and structural and functional properties of peptide conjugates containing bulky terminal aromatic substituents are reviewed with a particular focus on bioactivity.

        <p>The Fmoc group, of course, is used as a protecting group in peptide synthesis; [1][2][3] however, conjugates in which the Fmoc group is still attached have interesting aggregation properties which were among the first to be examined.

        <p>Reviews on peptide systems including N-terminal conjugates are available that cover conjugates with bulky N-terminal groups. [4][5][6][7][8][9] Enzyme-driven self-assembly has also been reviewed 10,11 as has the self-assembly of peptide conjugates in the cellular environment. 12,13 Peptide conjugates comprising a bulky hydrophobic terminal motif and a relatively hydrophilic peptide will be amphiphilic, and the use of bulky aromatic units means that π-π stacking interactions are important molecular aggregation processes. Noncovalent interactions between the π orbitals of aromatic rings lead to π-π stacking, also known as π-stacking, with several configurations of rings including face-face (with or without displacement) or edge-to-face interactions between the rings. The important role of π-stacking among aromatic residues is recognized for amyloid fibril formation. 14 Addition of nonnatural bulky aromatic residues generally enhances self-assembly into extended structures, as highlighted in numerous examples discussed herein. Such structures thus represent a valuable handle to drive peptide self-assembly. This can also lead to novel properties and activities, as highlighted throughout this Review.Reviews on peptide systems including N-terminal conjugates are available that cover conjugates with bulky N-terminal groups.

        <p>Peptide conjugate molecules have a tendency to self-assemble and form hydrogels with a fibrillar structure that entraps water within its mesh structure. A number of methods have been developed to produce hydrogels of peptide conjugates, including pH switching, solvent switching, heating/cooling and enzymatic methods, i.e., treatment of nonaggregating precursors with enzymes that remove units that hinder aggregation (e.g., dephosphorylation) or facilitate the coupling of nonaggregating precursors. Examples of all of these methods are discussed herein and in a previous overview of hydrogel preparation methods. 15 It is possible to tune the rheological properties (shear modulus) over a considerable range by judicious choice of peptide conjugate, concentration and other variables as highlighted by numerous examples discussed below. This has an impact on properties such as cytocompatibility and the facilitation of 2D or 3D cell culturing. Peptide conjugate structures have a remarkable diversity of other functions including optoelectronic properties, and uses slow-release delivery systems, supports for catalysis and others, as highlighted in the many examples discussed herein.Peptide conjugate molecules have a tendency to self-assemble and form hydrogels with a fibrillar structure that entraps water within its mesh structure.

        <p>This review does not include the extensive literature on peptides terminally modified with lipid chains (lipopeptides or peptide amphiphiles), a topic that has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] As is characteristic of overviews on fast-moving topics with broad interest, the current review provides a perspective of selected interesting works, since it is not possible to cover every paper on the subject. Also this field does not have rigid boundaries. For example, the term "bulky" terminal group does not have a rigorous definition, and the focus here is mainly on N-terminal conjugates since the majority of research has been on such hybrids.This review does not include the extensive literature on peptides terminally modified with lipid chains (lipopeptides or peptide amphiphiles), a topic that has been extensively reviewed elsewhere.

        <p>Mixtures. Fmoc-diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF) is probably the most widely studied N-terminally modified peptide. Fmoc-FF forms stiff hydrogels with a fibrillar nanostructure. 24,25 The hydrogel is able to support live CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) 24 cells, and it can support 2D or 3D culture of bovine chondrocyte 25 cells. Hydrogels can be formed by dilution of a HFIP stock solution with water at sufficiently high concentration, as reported by Gazit's group, 24 or by pH switch (initial increase with NaOH, then acidification by dropwise addition of HCl). 25 As a hydrophobic molecule, Fmoc-FF can be initially dissolved in DMSO (or HFIP) and upon dilution with water, hydrogelation is observed at concentrations as low as 0.01 wt %. 26 A gel phase diagram for Fmoc-FF has been presented (Figure 2) along with detailed rheological characterization of selected gels. 26 The different preparation methods and high sensitivity to preparation conditions lead to hydrogels with a very large variation in reported rheological properties (modulus). 27 The preparation of gels from organic solvent followed by addition of water leads to gels with a modulus that can be controlled by the choice of starting organic solvent. 28 This was shown to be related to changes in fibril morphology. Metastable gels are formed in acetone in which crystals are observed and these were used to obtain samples allowing single crystal structure determination from X-ray diffraction (XRD). 28 The final pH of the gels is the principal determinant of the mechanical properties independent of the method of gel formation. A slow pH reduction method was also presented that is based on hydrolysis of glucono-δ-lactone (GdL), which gives more reproducible gel properties. 27 A model for the packing of Fmoc-FF in fibrils was proposed based on interlocked stacking of β-sheets driven by π-stacking interactions, leading to a hollow core structure, i.e., a nanotube-like structure. 29 This would give rise to a distinct form factor in small-angle scattering data, which seems worthy of further examination. The aggregation of Fmoc conjugates can lead to significant shifts in pK a , as exemplified by acid titration studies on Fmoc-FF-OH for which two apparent pK a values are observed, both significantly different from the expected pK a = 3.5. 30 This was shown to be correlated with pHdependent morphological differences, specifically flexible fibrils forming a hydrogel were observed at high pH, but flat ribbons were noted at intermediate pH values in nongeling solutions. Shifts in pK a were likewise reported for Fmoc-FG, Fmoc-GG, and Fmoc-GF, and the apparent pK a values were found to correlate with the hydrophobicity of the Fmoc-dipeptides. 31 Fmoc-GG and Fmoc-FG only self-assemble below their apparent pK a (i.e., in their protonated form), in contrast to Fmoc-FG which self-assembles above and below its apparent pK a . It was also shown to exhibit the unusual property of gelation on heating. 31 Fmoc-FF hydrogels comprise a network of peptide nanotubelike fibrils and exhibit interesting optical properties resulting from quantum confinement, i.e., creation of excitons. 32 Photoluminescence excitation is observed, the development of which was monitored during hydrogel self-assembly. Metallogels have been produced by self-assembly of Fmoc-FF in the presence of various metal ions, and the conformational and morphological behavior were examined using an arsenal of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. 33 However, certain ions favor the formation of structures other than β-sheets, i.e., "superhelices" or random coils, depending on the mixing ratio of Fmoc-FF and metal ion. The metallogels prepared with Na + or Zn 2+ are able to bind DNA, the latter particularly rapidly. 33 Hydrogels containing mixtures of Fmoc-FF with Fmoc-R have been prepared due to interest in the affinity of arginine to hydroxyapatide. 34 The hydrogels supported adhesion of the fibroblasts studied. The chirality of fibrils containing Fmoc-FF can be tuned by coassembling with achiral pyridine derivatives due to different stacking modes (H-or J-aggregates). 35 The hydrogelation of Fmoc-dipeptide derivatives including Fmoc-AA, Fmoc-aa, Fmoc-GG, and others has been investigated and critical gel concentrations were determined as well as pH and temperature conditions for gel stability. 36 Fibrillar structures were imaged by electron microscopy. Fmoc-AA forms fibrils, although detailed computer simulations indicate that the dialanine adopts a mainly PPII structure, rather than β-sheets and that self-assembly is driven by Fmoc stacking rather than the typical hydrogen bonding of β-sheets. 37 The hydrogelation of several Fmoc-dipeptides was also noted by Ulijn's group and proliferation of chondrocytes was observed on Fmoc-FF as well as mixtures of this with Fmoc-GG or Fmoc-K. 25 This group also used Fmoc-FF as a structural component of bioactive scaffolds for 3D cell culture, in mixtures with bioactive Fmoc-RGD containing the bioactive integrin adhesion motif 38 RGD. 39 Mixtures of Fmoc-FF with Fmoc-K, Fmoc-D or Fmoc-S were also investigated for 2D and 3D culturing of several types of cell. Fmoc-FF/Fmoc-S hydrogels were found to be compatible with all three types of cell examined and was the only system able to support 3D culture of chondrocytes. 40 It was noted that it was not possible to disentangle the relative importance of mechanical properties and chemical functionalities on controlling cell behavior in Fmoc-peptide gels, although both are important and can be varied by formulation. The rheological properties of hydrogels formed by coassembly of Fmoc-FF with Fmoc-S, Fmoc-D, Fmoc-K, or Fmoc-Y have been measured and gel microparticles fabricated by the Pickering emulsion method have been examined as systems for catalysis using a model enzyme immobilized in the particles. 41 As mentioned above, the properties of Fmoc-FF hydrogel mixtures are sensitive to preparation method, as exemplified by a study on the mechanical properties and morphology of Fmoc-FF/Fmoc-GG mixtures. 42 Such variable properties motivated the use of GdL hydrolysis as a slow pH reduction process in the preparation of more homogeneous Fmoc-peptide hydrogels (shown for a range of Fmoc-dipeptides) with more reproducible properties. 43,44 In a more recent development, the ureasecatalyzed hydrolysis of urea has been used as a method to prepare homogeneous gels by slow pH increase (to pH 9), using for example Fmoc-K and related Fmoc-amino acids. 45 The gels are visibly more homogeneous than those obtained by simple addition of NaOH and the shear modulus can also be increased by adjustment of the urease concentration. The kinetics of pH increase and gelation depend on the initial (acidic) pH conditions and the nature of the acid used to create the starting state. 45 Fmoc-FpY [pY: phosphotyrosine] coassembles with Fmoc-S, Fmoc-T, or Fmoc-RGD when triggered by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) hydrolysis to form fibrils (and hydrogels), whereas the individual components form micelles. 46 Hydrogelation has also been observed for Fmoc-LD, Fmoc-AD, and Fmoc-ID and the gels show high thermostability. 47 Fmoc-LD hydrogels can be used to incorporate adamantanamine derivatives, which are inherently nonantigenic antiviral drugs The gels facilitate antigen presentation, as shown by the production of high titers of specific antibodies in a rabbit model. 47 Thin hydrogel membranes can be fabricated using electrodeposition of peptide conjugates such as Fmoc-LG. 48 Such layers can be used to seed the growth of fibrils from a solution of such a conjugate. 49 Electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry or multiple pulse amperometry) can also be used to probe the surface characteristics of peptide conjugate hydrogels, such as determination of pK a and measurement of charge and ion binding dynamics. 50 Linking Fmoc-FF C-terminally to a gold complex, Au(I)trisulfonated-triphenylphosphane leads to a peptide metalloamphiphile which self-assembles into luminescent micelles in aqueous buffer. 51 Coassembly of Fmoc-FF with FF leads to a composite hydrogel in which FF crystallization is modulated compared to FF crystallization from solution. 52 The kinetics of formation of the microcrystalline aggregates was also investigated.Mixtures.

        <p>Fmoc-dipeptides containing β-alanine (βA) have been developed since β-amino acids are resistant to proteolysis. 53 Conjugates Fmoc-βA-L or Fmoc-βA-F form fibrillar hydrogels, and the former indeed shows minimal degradation in proteinase K. The hydrogels show sustained release of model drugs (vitamin B2 or B12). 53 Fmoc-βAH (Fmoc-carnosine) also forms β-sheet fibrils above a critical aggregation concentration, and the chelation of zinc ions by the terminal H was examined. 54 This also changed the fibril morphology, and hydrogelation was observed at a suitable concentration of Zn 2+ ions. An Fmoc conjugate containing a β-amino acid, Fmoc-β-phenylalanine forms a hydrogel that undergoes syneresis, i.e., undergoes "selfshrinkage" with corresponding change in molecular packing (Jto H-aggregate type). 55 2.2. Fmoc-Amino Acids. Conjugation to Fmoc remarkably leads to self-assembly of single amino acids. Hydrogelation (in Na 2 CO 3 ) of Fmoc-L and Fmoc-K (and mixtures) was demonstrated. 56 Several Fmoc-amino acids have anti-inflammatory properties, 57 although Fmoc shows some cytotoxicity. 6 Fmoc-F forms fibrillar hydrogels, as demonstrated in a paper that also presents other derivatives of F with bulky N-terminal substituents. 58 Fmoc-F hydrogels have been used to host silver nanoclusters. Without requiring reducing agents, silver ions are complexed with the carboxylate groups of the free carboxylic acids of Fmoc-F and are reduced spontaneously in diffused sunlight to form silver nanoclusters within the gel, 59 following a method also demonstrated for Fmoc-VD hydrogels. 60 Fmoc-L is a Fmoc-amino acid with anti-inflammatory activity, 57 and it forms hydrogels when mixed with Fmoc-K. 61 Fmoc-amino acids can be used to create hydrogels for enzyme immobilization, as demonstrated with Fmoc-K/Fmoc-F mixtures with added enzymes including laccase, horseradish peroxidase, or αchymotrypsin. 62 Improved activity and stability of the hydrogel-immobilized enzymes was reported.Fmoc-dipeptides containing β-alanine (βA) have been developed since β-amino acids are resistant to proteolysis. 53 Conjugates Fmoc-βA-L or Fmoc-βA-F form fibrillar hydrogels, and the former indeed shows minimal degradation in proteinase K.

        <p>Nilsson's group carefully examined the self-assembly and gelation properties of Fmoc-F-based compounds with halo-genated phenyl groups. 63,64 Distinct fibril morphologies, spectroscopic characteristics, and hydrogel rheological modulus are reported, depending on the nature of the halogen and position of substitution. 63 In one comparison, Fmoc-F5-Phe (containing perfluorinated phenylalanine) was shown to gel much more rapidly and at lower concentrations than Fmoc-Y. 65 Additional studies concerned coassembly of Fmoc-F5-Phe with Fmoc-F5-Phe-dEG (dEG: diethylene glycol) 66 or of Fmoc-F5-Phe with Fmoc-Phe or monohalogenated Fmoc-Phe derivatives, 67 or with Fmoc-FF. 68 In the latter case, a focus on gel modulus revealed that a storage modulus near 200 kPa for a 1:1 mixture is attainable, corresponding to a highly rigid supramolecular hydrogel. 68 Whereas Fmoc-L-DOPA(acetonated)-D-Phe-OMe and FF on their own form globular aggregates, coassembly leads to self-assembled nanostructures resembling red blood cells or spherical structures with bulges on their outer surface (like white blood cells), depending on concentration. 69 The coassembly of Fmoc-L-DOPA(acetonated)f-OMe with other diphenylalanine analogues was also examined. A review focused on coassembly of peptide conjugates is available. 70 Fmoc-F or Fmoc-Y gels prepared using GdL hydrolysis have demonstrated slow release of model dyes. 71 Self-assembly of Fmoc-Y can be induced via ALP treatment of Fmoc-pY precursor, which itself forms micelles above a critical micelle concentration. 72,73 The kinetics of the self-assembly and gelation process were probed using time-resolved rheology and spectroscopic techniques. 73 The hydrogel modulus can be tuned via concentration of ALP. 74 The modulation of nanostructure by substitution within Fmoc-F(4-X)F was examined, where F(4-X) denotes phenylalanine modified at the 4-position with electron withdrawing groups, e.g., F, CN, NO 2 . 75 Dipeptides were formed via thermolysin-mediated condensation of Fmoc-F(4-X)-OH and F-NH 2 (vide infra).Nilsson's group carefully examined the self-assembly and gelation properties of Fmoc-F-based compounds with halo-genated phenyl groups. 63,64 Distinct fibril morphologies, spectroscopic characteristics, and hydrogel rheological modulus are reported, depending on the nature of the halogen and position of substitution. 63 In one comparison, Fmoc-F5-Phe (containing perfluorinated phenylalanine) was shown to gel much more rapidly and at lower concentrations than Fmoc-Y. 65 Additional studies concerned coassembly of Fmoc-F5-Phe with Fmoc-F5-Phe-dEG (dEG: diethylene glycol) 66 or of Fmoc-F5-Phe with Fmoc-Phe or monohalogenated Fmoc-Phe derivatives, 67 or with Fmoc-FF. 68 In the latter case, a focus on gel modulus revealed that a storage modulus near 200 kPa for a 1:1 mixture is attainable, corresponding to a highly rigid supramolecular hydrogel. 68 Whereas Fmoc-L-DOPA(acetonated)-D-Phe-OMe and FF on their own form globular aggregates, coassembly leads to self-assembled nanostructures resembling red blood cells or spherical structures with bulges on their outer surface (like white blood cells), depending on concentration. 69 The coassembly of Fmoc-L-DOPA(acetonated)f-OMe with other diphenylalanine analogues was also examined.

Gazit and co-workers showed that other conjugates based on Fmoc-F (and a related naphthyl alanine 2-Nal derivative, and Fmoc-RGD) such as those shown in Figure 3 form hydrogels. 76 The morphology was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and viability of CHO cells was examined for a subset of the derivatives. Good viability was observed for Fmoc-FRGD and Fmoc-RGDF (after 1 day incubation), whereas the cells on Fmoc-2-Nal showed low viability. 76 The rheological properties, structure (via fiber XRD) and appearance (turbidity) of these samples was also investigated. 77 The self-assembly and hydrogelation properties were analyzed for Fmoc-VLK(Boc) and Fmoc-K(Boc)LV, both containing K protected by N ε -tert-butyloxycarbonate (Boc). 78 The former peptide forms highly anisotropic fibrils in borate buffer which show local alignment, and also hydrogels with flow-aligning properties. In contrast, Fmoc-K(Boc)LV forms highly branched fibrils that produce isotropic hydrogels with a higher modulus. The distinct self-assembled structures were ascribed to conformational differences, as revealed by spectroscopic probes of secondary structure and X-ray diffraction. 78 In related work, Fmoc-K(Fmoc) has been shown to form fibrillar gels in aqueous buffer solutions with distinct pH-dependent rheological properties. 79 Fmoc-K(Fmoc)D, another conjugate with a double branched Fmoc structure, forms hydrogels with a very low critical gel concentration. 80 The hydrogels are suitable for 2D or 3D cell culturing and hybrid gels of this conjugate with polyaniline (prepared by oxidative polymerization in situ) show metal-like electrical conductivity as well as DNA binding ability. 80 Attaching NDI (naphthalene diimide, section 6) via a lysine side chain in Fmoc-KK(NDI) gives a conjugate that forms hydrogels with a morphology of nanotapes driven by πstacking of both Fmoc and NDI units. 81 Fmoc-KK(Pyrene)K meanwhile forms β-sheet nanotapes, a distinct morphology to that for peptides lacking the terminal N-terminal Fmoc. 82 Other Fmoc-tripeptides studied include Fmoc-FWK (uncapped or C-terminal capped). 83 The uncapped peptide selfassembles into helical structures such as twisted nanoribbons at pH 11.2-11.8, or nanofibers at pH 5 and 12 or flat ribbons composed of many fibrils for pH 6-11.

Hydrogels were also observed at higher concentration, and these were used in preliminary cell culture experiments which showed viable bovine fibroblasts on Fmoc-RGD hydrogels but not Fmoc-GRD, 84 consistent with the expected bioactivity of the integrin adhesion motif. In a similar vein, Fmoc-RGDS and scrambled Fmoc-GRDS have been investigated using a combination of experimental and modeling methods. 85 As for the Fmoc conjugates to shorter tripeptide sequences, β-sheet fibrils and hydrogels were observed at sufficiently high concentration. 85 The UV-vis and IR absorbance spectra of Fmoc-GRDS as well as Fmoc itself and of the fluorene building block, and the linear and circular dichroism spectra of these D molecules along with Raman spectra, have been analyzed in detail and compared. 86 A conjugate of Fmoc with a transthyretin core amyloidforming peptide sequence YTIAALLSPYS forms β-sheet fibrils and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy showed excimer formation within the fluorophores in the fibrils. 87 A number of methoxycarbonyl derivatives have been linked N-terminally to FF to produce stimulus responsive hydrogels, specifically responsive to oxidation, reduction or light using pborono-phenylmethoxycarbonyl (BPmoc), p-nitro-phenylmethoxycarbonyl (NPmoc), or 6-bromo-7-hydroxycoumarin-4ylmethoxycarbonyl (Bhcmoc) (Figure 4). 88 TEM on BPmoc-FF showed a fibrillar structure in the gels with a β-sheet structure based on XRD and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.The conformation and self-assembly of Fmoc-peptides bearing the integrin cell adhesion motif RGD (or scrambled sequence GRD) has been studied. 84 It was shown that Fmoc drives the self-assembly via aromatic stacking interactions and that β-sheet fibrils are formed at sufficiently high concentration.

Hydrogels were observed for all conjugates via pH switch using GdL. The cytotoxicity was also examined along with interactions with tethered lipid membranes. 91 Fmoc-tetrapeptides DAAR or DGGR contain dialanine or diglycine substrates for enzymes including chymotrypsin, elastase or thermolysin. This has been used in an enzyme detection system based on covalent linking of the Fmoc peptides to PEGA (PEG/acrylamide copolymer) particles containing dextran which swell due to enzyme cleavage (which leads to D/R zwitterion formation) and dextran release. 92 Fmoc-hexapeptides such as Fmoc-ILVAGK, Fmoc-LIVAGK, and Fmoc-AIVAGK containing cationic residues are able to form hydrogels, whereas hydrogels are not observed for conjugates with FF added in the sequence in Fmoc-FFILVAGK etc. 93 This highlights the importance of the balance between aromatic interactions and others such as electrostatic forces. The conformation and critical aggregation concentration of these conjugates was carefully determined. 93 Mixing these Fmocpeptides with Fmoc-FF leads to self-sorted fibrillar hydrogels with tunable, wide range of modulus. 94 The hydrogels have generally excellent cytocompatibility, pointing to their potential use as synthetic extracellular matrices.Fmoc tripeptides containing carnosine (β-alanine-histidine) at the C-terminus along with Fmoc-linked A, V, F, L, Y, I or M have been shown to form fibrillar hydrogels with a J-aggregate structure due to π-stacking of Fmoc groups. 89 Fmoc peptides based on the IKVAV laminin sequence (laminin is a component of the extracellular matrix) that have been studied include Fmoc-IKVAV, Fmoc-DIKVAV and Fmoc-DDDIKVAV. 90 These conjugates form fibrillar hydrogels under appropriate pH conditions, the nanofibrous matrix being of interest for proposed cell culture, since the gels have storage modulus values similar to those of soft tissues (being an order of magnitude higher for the D-containing conjugates). 90 Fmoc-tetrapeptides Fmoc-XXFF where X indicates a polar residue, i.e., charged D, E, R or K or neutral N or Q have been prepared and studied. 91 Fibrils were observed for all conjugates containing charged residues but not those with neutral N or F.

        <p>The packing within fibrillar hydrogels such as Fmoc-YL can be tuned by thermal annealing, which influences the balance between hydrogen bonding and π-stacking interactions, as revealed by detailed FTIR, NMR, and CD measurements. 101 The influence of the chemical nature of the linker between the fluorenyl group and a dipeptide has been examined using four fluorenyl derivatives of different flexibility and YL as model dipeptide. 102 It was demonstrated that the methoxycarbonyl group present in Fmoc is optimal, being a rigid linker of sufficient length between the bulky aromatic and peptide groups. Fmoc-YL was also used as a model system for examining the influence of salts from the Hofmeister series on the conformation and self-assembly of hydrogel-forming Fmocpeptides (different morphologies were observed with different anions), as well as the gel properties including melting temperature and modulus. 103 Anions were also found to promote hydrophobic interactions, and thus self-assembly, in Fmoc-YL, Fmoc-VL, and Fmoc-LL, although this occurs to a lesser extent with Fmoc-AA which is less hydrophobic. The effects of Hofmeister series salts on the subtilisin-induced selfassembly (vide infra) of Fmoc-YL-OH were also elucidated, and distinct modes of chiral organization and self-assembly were revealed. 104 Salt effects on the enzyme network were also uncovered, this in turn affecting the kinetics of enzyme activity and the resultant nucleation and growth of nanostructures. It was also shown that the enzyme-catalyzed assembly processes are kinetically controlled, and thermodynamically favored states can be accessed by heating/cooling treatment. 104 Enzymatic hydrolysis can be used to remove C-terminal esters to drive self-assembly of Fmoc-peptides. This has been extensively explored by the Ulijn group. 105,106 Figure 5 shows the hydrolysis process along with images of a hydrogel formed by Fmoc-LL after treatment with subtilisin and a schematic of the self-assembly process. 105 The hydrogels comprise fibrils or nanotubes depending on the peptide. The effect of enzyme concentration in improving supramolecular ordering was probed for a series of Fmoc-dipeptides including Fmoc-FF, Fmoc-YL, and others. 106 It was shown that increase of enzyme concentration leads to bundling of the peptide conjugates and greater fibril network connectivity and rigidity, with reduced mobility of enzyme clusters which reduces discontinuities in fibril assembly.

        <p>The hydrogelation ability of a series of naphthalene-based dipeptide conjugates (dipeptides linked to N-terminal naphthalene via a (2-yloxy)acetic acid unit or other linker) has been examined. 116 Hydrogels were observed for Nap-GG, Nap-Ga, Nap-GA, Nap-GS, at low pH, although a gel-sol transition is observed on heating, at around 50 °C. The gels comprise fibrillar structures and show good cytocompatibility with HeLa cells. 116 A considerable number of naphthalene-dipeptides (Figure 8) have been screened for their ability to form a hydrogel, and adsorption isotherm measurements were performed, which provided values for cmc (critical micelle concentration), airwater partition coefficient, and area per molecule for the compounds. 117 Nap-FF is a hydrogelator as are a range of other Nap-FF-based derivatives. 118 As for Fmoc conjugates discussed in the previous Section, hydrogels can be prepared by different methods from a solution at an initial pH including via addition of salt, by pH reduction, upon addition of acid or hydration of an initial solution in organic solvent. 119 This leads to differences in the fibril morphology (as detected by microscopy and small-angle scattering) and the gel mechanical properties. 119 It is also possible to create hydrogels using a photoacid generator in the presence of UV light, as demonstrated for Nap-FF and other Nap-dipeptide derivatives and a Fmoc-dipeptide. 120 The photoacid generator is used to lower the pH of a peptide conjugate below the apparent pK a of the gelator, leading to gelation.The hydrogelation ability of a series of naphthalene-based dipeptide conjugates (dipeptides linked to N-terminal naphthalene via a (2-yloxy)acetic acid unit or other linker) has been examined. 116 Hydrogels were observed for Nap-GG, Nap-Ga, Nap-GA, Nap-GS, at low pH, although a gel-sol transition is observed on heating, at around 50 °C.

        <p>Addition of divalent cations at high pH has been used to produce hydrogels of Nap-FF, with a high value of the storage modulus. 121 This was ascribed to the formation of salt bridges between the carboxylates on the wormlike micelles that are formed at high pH in this system. The concentration-driven transition from spherical to worm-like micelles in Nap-FF solutions has been studied, along with the formation of gels formed by addition to Ca 2+ to a solution of wormlike micelles. 122 Nap-FF forms a transient gel at low pH (pH &lt; 5.7), then addition of NaOH drives a gel-sol transition, and an out-ofequilibrium state can be produced by using the urease-catalyzed hydrolysis of urea (section 2.1) to increase pH. 123 Homogeneous gelation can then be driven at high pH by the addition of Ca 2+ ions. It is possible to produce a system that shows dynamic degelation, then regelation by adjustment of the concentrations of Nap-FF, urease, urea, and Ca 2+ . 123 The mesh size of Ca 2+induced Nap-FF gels has been estimated using pulsed-field gradient NMR via measurements of the self-diffusion of dextrans with different molar masses and hence radii of gyration (covering the range of expected pore sizes within the fibrillar gel network). 124 Heat-cool treatment of high pH solutions of Nap-FF can also be used to produce viscous solutions of wormlike micelles (hollow cylinders), the mechanical properties of which have been examined during capillary breakup under extensional deformation. 125 Addition of CaCl 2 after the heating step gives a more transparent gel. An analogue of Nap-FF, containing 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene forms gels in the presence of Ca 2+ that can be drawn or spun into "noodles" (macroscopic fibers), the mechanical properties of which were analyzed. 126 The effect of different alkaline hydroxides on the solution morphology and viscosity of Nap-FF has been examined. 127 The assembly process of BrNap-AV has been investigated with solution state NMR spectroscopy. 128 Using molecular probes ( 14 NH 4 + and isopropanol-d 8 ) in residual quadrupolar coupling (RQC) measurements, as well as the NMR relaxation rates of 23 Na + , it was possible to obtain information on the charge, hydrophobicity, and molecular structure within aggregates which are silent in conventional 1 H NMR spectroscopy due to low mobility of the molecules. A multistage process driven by neutralization as pH is reduced was uncovered. 128 As well as these RQC and saturation transfer difference probe molecule methods (using a range of positive ion, hydrophobic, ion binding, and NMR pH indicator probes), chemical shift imaging has also been used to study the binding of Ca 2+ to Nap-FF, BrNap-AV, and Fmoc-LG, following the formation of hydrogels along chemical gradients. 129 Self-sorting is observed for gels of BrNap-AV with Nap-FF due to the distinct pK a values for the two molecules which facilitates separate self-assembly induced by the GdL hydrolysis method of pH reduction, the former conjugate aggregating first at a higher pH. 130 The structure of Nap-FF fibrils has been investigated in detail using small-angle scattering and MD simulations. 131 In particular, contrast variation SANS using a range of selectively deuterated Nap-FF compounds was employed to gain insight into the molecular organization within the fibrils, which it is proposed have a hollow cylinder structure in the solution state, although this nanostructure is lost as gelation occurs. 131 Caution is required since, in certain cases, isotope effects on selfassembled structures are observed for peptide conjugates when comparing small-angle scattering data and/or cryo-TEM for H 2 O and D 2 O solutions, i.e., the same structure is not always observed in the two solutions. 132 SANS has also been used to probe the effect of drying on the fibril network of Nap-FF and related conjugates, via changes in H or D content, following removal of H 2 O or D 2 O from gels of partially or undeuterated Nap-FF (or 6Br-Nap-FF) to produce xerogels. 133 This showed that drying does affect the fibril network. Addition of coumarin to a gel of a Nap-FF analogue [containing 3,8a-dihydro-2Hchromen-2-one] leads to coassembly, and exposure to UV leads to coumarin dimerization which affects the molecular packing in the fibrils and the stiffness (shear modulus). 134 Drop-casting of Nap-FF (or BrNap-FF or BrNap-AV) in a high pH solution onto a low pH subphase leads to films comprising a fibril network. 135 Coassembly of Nap-FF and a Fmoc-amine (Figure 9) leads to two-proposed modes of aggregation in a multicomponent gel, depending on pH. 136 Nap-FF-OH coassembles with a pyrene ammonium salt to form a fibrillar gel. 137 The gel can be crosslinked using hydrolysis of carbodiimide EDC [1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide], which leads to enhancement of the gel shear moduli.Addition of divalent cations at high pH has been used to produce hydrogels of Nap-FF, with a high value of the storage modulus. 121 This was ascribed to the formation of salt bridges between the carboxylates on the wormlike micelles that are formed at high pH in this system.

        <p>early example, Nap-FF was linked to a C-terminal butyric acid unit, which is a substrate for esterase. 138 Intracellular esterase activity leads to self-assembly of Nap-FF-OH into fibrils which were found to be selectively cytotoxic to HeLa cells, but not NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Figure 10). Nap-F with a related Cterminal extension also forms hydrogels after exposure to esterase. 139 The hydrogel is anisotropic, as shown by the presence of birefringence when viewed between crossed polars. Nap-FF forms fibrils in aqueous solution and its crystal structure has been reported, enabling a model for the molecular packing in the fibrils to be proposed. 140 This conjugate shows selective cytotoxicity to glioblastoma cells due to its propensity to aggregate into fibrils, as opposed to the lack of toxicity to neuronal cells. 140 The selective inhibition of glioblastoma cells was ascribed to interaction with microtubules, as revealed by confocal cell imaging using tubulin tracker dye. Nap has also been conjugated to the C-terminus of diphenylalanine, with 3 different length linkers and the resulting conjugates are also fibril-forming hydrogelators, with selective activity against cancer cells (HeLa compared to noncancerous Ect1/E6E7 cells). 141 Nap-FF has also been used as a self-assembly scaffold to attach cationic lysine or ornithine residues in the development of antimicrobial nanomaterials. 142 The conjugates form fibrillar hydrogels and the greatest antimicrobial activity was displayed by Nap-FFKK against Staphylococcus epidermis biofilm. However, this compound is unfortunately also cytotoxic to murine fibroblasts and also exhibited substantial hemolysis against equine red blood cells. 142 Cytotoxicity against mammalian cells obviously needs to be minimized along with substantial antibacterial activity, for a practically useful antimicrobial agent. Antimicrobial activity is also observed for Nap-FF mixed with dopamine. 143 The latter undergoes autoxidation in the presence of molecular oxygen to form quinones, with H 2 O 2 as a byproduct, which has antimicrobial properties. Antimicro-bial activity of gels incorporating dopamine was observed at high pH for Staphylococcus species. 143 A range of conjugates comprising naphthalene derivatives (with Br-, CN-, or H at the 6-position) linked to dipeptides AV has been prepared to examine gelation propensity, after preparation using pH reduction by GdL hydrolysis. 144,145 The nature of the naphthalene derivative influences hydrogen bonding and π-stacking and hence molecular packing, while the chirality of the assemblies probed by CD depends on the dipeptide sequence. Nap-AA forms gels (by GdL treatment of an initial pH 10.5 solution) in which crystals form slowly, and the kinetics of this process were analyzed by time-resolved smallangle X-ray scattering/wide-angle X-ray scattering. 146 The ability of Nap-AA to form crystals from a hydrogel had previously been noted in a screening study on Nap-dipeptide systems comparing gel vs crystal formation. 147 The structure in the crystal is the same as that in the dried gel, although it differs from that of hydrated fibrils.early example, Nap-FF was linked to a C-terminal butyric acid unit, which is a substrate for esterase. 138 Intracellular esterase activity leads to self-assembly of Nap-FF-OH into fibrils which were found to be selectively cytotoxic to HeLa cells, but not NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Figure 10).

        <p>EISA can be modulated by ligand-receptor interactions as shown in an investigation of the behavior of Nap-FFpYGGaa which contains pY, along with di-D-alanine (aa) as receptor for the ligand vancomycin. 169 ALP activity converts the precursor into Nap-FFYGGaa which forms fibrils, however in the presence of the ligand, aggregates comprising precipitates of shorter fibrils are formed. Vancomycin is unable to interact with the fibrils within hydrogels formed in the former case, but the hydrogels can be broken up using surfactants, which facilitates ligandreceptor interactions. 169 A competition between assembly and disassembly is observed for the enzyme-driven interaction between Nap-Y-OMe and amino acid amides F-NH 2 , Y-NH 2 or L-NH 2 . 170 α-Chymotrypsin drives trans-acylation (forward reaction, leading to temporary formation of a hydrogel of 2 at the top of Figure 16) which occurs under kinetic control.

A dipeptide (KK) was functionalized at the ε-amino position of lysine with an NDI chromophore and an N-terminal Fmoc group. 81 As mentioned in section 2.3, a hydrogel was formed based on peptide conjugate self-assembly into nanotapes and a detailed model for molecular packing in the nanotapes was presented, based on XRD and other methods. 81 Remarkably, nanotubes were observed for NDI derivatives with lysine as headgroups on each imide unit 203 or with one lysine headgroup on NDI with a butyl chain on the other imide unit. 204 Aggregation of PDI derivatives of bolaamphiphile form with symmetric peptide groups on both imide groups or one peptide and one dodecyl chain was examined using UV-vis spectroscopic methods to probe H-or J-aggregate formation. 205 In related work, a series of peptide derivatives of PDI with G-X-Y (X = G 3 , A 3 and others, Y = E or E 3 ) tripeptides symmetrically on both imine groups or with a hexyl chain on one imide nitrogen (and tripeptide on the other) (Figure 22) were prepared and self-assembly (fibril formation) was observed for the former class. 206 Thermodynamic data for all compounds was obtained from temperature-dependent measurements of UV-vis spectra corresponding to H-aggregates. 206 The self-assembly of two Cbz-L-lysine-functionalized tetrachloroperylene bisimides (4ClPBI-Lys) with αor ε-Cbz linkage into different nanostructures including nanospheres, fibrils, and nanotapes was observed in acetone/water mixtures. 207Naphthalene diimide (NDI) and perylene diimide (PDI) (also known as perylene bisimide) are model bulky π-conjugated molecules with interesting (opto-)electronic properties.

        <p>Bola-amphiphiles based on PDI with (GD) 2 or (GY) 2 peptide units show fluorescence properties that are tunable in organic solvents (see for example Figure 23), depending also on peptide concentration. 208 Fibrillar or nanosphere structures were observed depending on the solvent and the (GY) 2 conjugate also shows gelation behavior in water or DMF, while the (GD) 2 conjugates can form gels in DMF or DMSO. 208 Bola-amphiphiles have also been prepared with an NDI core, alkyl chain spacers and short terminal sequences of F or V. 209 These form organogels with a fibrillar structure with J-type aggregates, and undergo aggregation-driven changes in fluorescence, as well as having interesting conductivity behavior. 209 A core-substituted NDI shown in Figure 24 shows solvatochromism, with different colors in different solvents. 210 In addition, there is a notable change in fluorescence color in the presence of micelles of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (due to a change in molecular packing) and finally in water the fluorescence intensity can be used as a sensitive probe of nitrite ions, even in the presence of other anions. 210Bola-amphiphiles based on PDI with (GD) 2 or (GY) 2 peptide units show fluorescence properties that are tunable in organic solvents (see for example Figure 23), depending also on peptide concentration. 208 Fibrillar or nanosphere structures were observed depending on the solvent and the (GY) 2 conjugate also shows gelation behavior in water or DMF, while the (GD) 2 conjugates can form gels in DMF or DMSO. 208 Bola-amphiphiles have also been prepared with an NDI core, alkyl chain spacers and short terminal sequences of F or V. 209 These form organogels with a fibrillar structure with J-type aggregates, and undergo aggregation-driven changes in fluorescence, as well as having interesting conductivity behavior. 209 A core-substituted NDI shown in Figure 24 shows solvatochromism, with different colors in different solvents. 210 In addition, there is a notable change in fluorescence color in the presence of micelles of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (due to a change in molecular packing) and finally in water the fluorescence intensity can be used as a sensitive probe of nitrite ions, even in the presence of other anions. 210</p>
        <p>Anthracene has, surprisingly, been relatively less investigated as a bulky N-terminal unit. In one study, hydrogelation in salt solutions or cell culture media was observed for aromatic amino acids F or Y with N-terminal anthracene-2-carbonyl groups. 211 Photodissociation of the gels was demonstrated due to anthracene dimerization upon exposure to 365 nm light, which was shown to be a suitable means to release cells from the 3D culture environment.Anthracene has, surprisingly, been relatively less investigated as a bulky N-terminal unit.

        <p>The Nap-Gffy construct discussed in section 3 has been modified by replacement of Nap with N-terminal NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) groups (which are aromatic moieties) including naproxen and ibuprofen (Figure 25 shows structures). 212 These compounds form fibrillar hydrogels that can be used as vaccine adjuvants by incorporating an ovalbumin antigen in the gel. Increased immunoglobulin production compared to OVA alone was noted, along with enhanced levels of IFN-γ and IL-6 cytokines. 212 A range of NSAIDs including several of those shown in Figure 25 have been incorporated in self-assembling conjugates to diand tripeptides including FF, ff, FFY, ffy, and AA. 213 The hydrogelation properties were examined, fibril structures imaged, and compatibility with HeLa cells tested.The Nap-Gffy construct discussed in section 3 has been modified by replacement of Nap with N-terminal NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) groups (which are aromatic moieties) including naproxen and ibuprofen (Figure 25 shows structures). 212 These compounds form fibrillar hydrogels that can be used as vaccine adjuvants by incorporating an ovalbumin antigen in the gel.

        <p>Peptides can be used to direct the self-assembly of phenylenevinylenes. Tovar's group prepared symmetric bolaamphiphiles with a short (trimeric) oligo-phenylenevinylene core which is π-conjugated and hence has organic electronic properties. 214 Peptides used to direct structure include those that form amyloid-like fibrils via β-sheet formation such as tetrapeptides AAFD or GAFD. 214 Conjugates of oligophenylenevinylenes, OPVs (Figure 26) with peptides were prepared and their self-assembly examined in aqueous solution. 215 The peptides were GAGAG or GANP-NAAG, the former pentapeptide contains AG repeats observed in crystalline β-sheet domains (in silk). The latter comprises a sequence from CS protein of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Scanning tunneling microscopy was possible due to the conductivity of the OPV units, and this showed bilayer arrangements, while in bulk solution, fibrils (cylindrical micelles) were observed. 215 An electroactive p-type tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-dipeptide bioconjugate has been created using a TTF moiety appended with diphenylalanine amide. 216 The hybrid self-assembles into one-dimensional nanofibers that underpin the formation of selfsupporting organogels in chloroform and ethyl acetate, in contrast to TTF-L 3 -OMe. Doping of the gels with electron acceptors leads to two-component charge transfer gels in these organic solvents. A π-extended peptide-TTF containing the AGAGA peptide serves as electron-donor in a mixture with a perylene-bisimide (PBI) (nonpeptide) derivative as electronacceptor, these forming separate n-and p-conducting nanofibers. Photoconductivity measurements for coassembled systems demonstrated the effectiveness of these heterojunction structures, with applications in optoelectronics and photovoltaics. 217 1,4-Distyrylbenzene has been used as a bulky terminal group in symmetric bolaamphiphiles with terminal tetrapeptides containing D, F, and A or G (Figure 27). 218 The peptide sequence influences the photophysical properties of the chromophore in the conjugates. Photoluminescence spectra showed features ranging from structured excitonic-like emission expected for H-aggregates to charge transfer-like excimer emission.

        <p>Carbazole-alanine (Figure 28) forms gels via pH switch driven by GdL hydrolysis. 219 Electropolymerization was also demonstrated to produce microporous hydrogel structures, the resulting films being electrochromic; i.e., it was possible to switch between green (oxidized form) and colorless (reduced form) using cyclic voltammetry. 219 NBD has been conjugated to a peptide derived from the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases and a pY sequence, leading to EISA into fibrils after dephosphorylation (and gels with suitable heat treatment). 150 NBD-ff has been functionalized with a C-terminal ester cleavage linker to taurine. 220 The incorporation of taurine was found to greatly enhance the cellular uptake of the D-peptide conjugates, and intracellular esterase activity leads to intracellular fibrillisation. The mechanism of endocytosis was also examined. 220 NBD-ff has also been used as a fluorophore-bearing proteolysis-resistant scaffold to attach peptide thioesters (Figure 29). 221 These act as substrates for thioesterases to target the Golgi apparatus (GA) of cells. GA-associated thioesterases hydrolyze the peptide conjugates leading to thiopeptide dimers which accumulate in the GA. This leads to cell death due to disruption of protein trafficking. Thiophosphopeptides such as those shown in Figure 29 can also enter cells via calveolin-mediated endocytosis and undergo dephosphorylation (and disulfide bond formation) to produce thiopeptides that accumulate in the GA. 222 The thiophosphopeptide also selectively inhibits HeLa cancer cells compared to immortalized noncancerous cell lines.Carbazole-alanine (Figure 28) forms gels via pH switch driven by GdL hydrolysis. 219 Electropolymerization was also demonstrated to produce microporous hydrogel structures, the resulting films being electrochromic; i.e., it was possible to switch between green (oxidized form) and colorless (reduced form) using cyclic voltammetry. 219 NBD has been conjugated to a peptide derived from the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases and a pY sequence, leading to EISA into fibrils after dephosphorylation (and gels with suitable heat treatment). 150 NBD-ff has been functionalized with a C-terminal ester cleavage linker to taurine. 220 The incorporation of taurine was found to greatly enhance the cellular uptake of the D-peptide conjugates, and intracellular esterase activity leads to intracellular fibrillisation.

        <p>Attachment of a ferrocenoyl (Fc) group introduces a metalloaromatic unit into peptide conjugates. In one example, Fcphenylalanine has been shown to form fibrillar hydrogels (in a pH-responsive fashion), in contrast, Fc-Y, Fc-W, Fc-H, Fc-A and Fc-K do not form hydrogels. 223 The Fc moiety leads to electrochemical activity, with a potential application as an electron transfer matrix for immobilized enzymes. A conjugate of Fc with the short amyloid-forming peptide VFF forms an organogel in toluene, the fibrillar network structure being disrupted upon oxidation to give spherical micelles. 224 Diphenylalanine (with OtBu C-terminus) has been modified with a 4-phenylpyridinium group at the N-terminus to promote cation-π interactions, in a study of dipeptide-based coacervation (liquid-liquid phase separation). 225 (E)-2-(4-(Phenyldiazenyl)phenyl) acetic acid (Figure 30) has been employed as the N-terminal group in conjugates with a series of dipeptides. 226 The azobenzene moiety can undergo a conformational (stereoisomer) switch in response to UV light, which changes the molecular packing (Figure 30), and this can drive a gel-sol transition. The hydrogelation of azobenzene conjugates with other bioactive peptide sequences such as RGD, and laminin fragments IKVAV and YIGSR were also investigated, and it was shown that the photoresponsiveness could be used for controlled release of the model drug vitamin B12. 226 Biotin is a bulky unit with bioactivity (it is vitamin B7) that has been used an N-terminal unit in conjugates with peptides such as amyloid-forming sequences (with RGD incorporated in the sequence). 227 Fibrils are retained for the biotinylated conjugate. 227 (S)-Aroylthiooxime (SATO) has been used as a bulky Nterminal group acting as a thiol-triggered H 2 S donor, in conjugates to the β-sheet IAVEEE hexapeptide with a range of linkers. 228,229 Fibrils were observed by TEM and gels were formed under physiological pH conditions, from which H 2 S release was quantified.Attachment of a ferrocenoyl (Fc) group introduces a metalloaromatic unit into peptide conjugates.

        <p>Attachment of the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) unit to FF leads to self-assembly into fibrils, similar to those for Fmoc-FF. 231 This unit has been used as an N-terminal group for tetrapeptide GFFY, leading to a fibrillar hydrogelator. 166 Hydrogels with a fibrillar structure have also been observed for Cbz-tetrapeptides with sequences based on arrangements of pairs of F and D residues. 232 Self-assembly into fibrils is even observed for conjugates of Cbz N-terminally attached to the single amino acid phenylalanine, provided the pH is sufficiently low, and urease can be used to disassemble the fibrils. 233 In contrast, Cbz conjugated to dipeptides FL, FI, FV, or FY does not form fibrillar hydrogels, although this can be induced by addition of lipase or thermolysin. 234 Cholesteryl groups were attached N-terminally to peptides A 4 G 3 KRGDS and A 4 G 2 EGRGDS. 197 These were shown to form fibrils with a β-sheet conformation revealed by circular dichroism spectroscopy under appropriate pH conditions.Attachment of the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) unit to FF leads to self-assembly into fibrils, similar to those for Fmoc-FF. 231 This unit has been used as an N-terminal group for tetrapeptide GFFY, leading to a fibrillar hydrogelator. 166 Hydrogels with a fibrillar structure have also been observed for Cbz-tetrapeptides with sequences based on arrangements of pairs of F and D residues. 232 Self-assembly into fibrils is even observed for conjugates of Cbz N-terminally attached to the single amino acid phenylalanine, provided the pH is sufficiently low, and urease can be used to disassemble the fibrils. 233 In contrast, Cbz conjugated to dipeptides FL, FI, FV, or FY does not form fibrillar hydrogels, although this can be induced by addition of lipase or thermolysin. 234 Cholesteryl groups were attached N-terminally to peptides A 4 G 3 KRGDS and A 4 G 2 EGRGDS. 197 These were shown to form fibrils with a β-sheet conformation revealed by circular dichroism spectroscopy under appropriate pH conditions.</p>
        <p>This review has highlighted recent exciting work that has explored the self-assembly of conjugates comprising bulky aromatic termini linked to short peptide sequences or even individual amino acids. These bulky units promote selfassembly, primarily through π-stacking interactions. From another perspective, it can be considered that the peptide unit modulates the packing of the aromatic units through peptide hydrogen-bonding interactions (and others), and this can be used to tune optoelectronic properties for example. As highlighted by many examples in this Review, peptide conjugates designed to incorporate bulky aromatic units can be used to create nanomaterials for a diversity of materials science and biomedical applications.This review has highlighted recent exciting work that has explored the self-assembly of conjugates comprising bulky aromatic termini linked to short peptide sequences or even individual amino acids.

        <p>Several major themes emerge from the discussion in this review. First, that the formation of fibrillar hydrogels is a common feature, the fibrils comprising β-sheet structures. The hydrogels have a range of rheological characteristics that cover the stiffness of most tissues in vivo, and beyond. A second feature is the remarkable development of enzyme-responsive selfassembling conjugates using a diversity of enzymes. In one example, this enables intracellular aggregation in response to native enzymes, which can facilitate localization in specific cellular compartments as demonstrated in research by the group of Bing Xu, for example. In another example, reverse hydrolysis can be used to condense peptide conjugates and amino acids, and combined hydrolysis/reverse hydrolysis can occur under thermodynamic control. This type of enzyme-controlled reaction can be combined with others to create enzymatic cascades. There are many opportunities to extend this work to other biologically relevant or catalytically important enzymatic (cascade) pathways. A third major theme is the distinctive electronic and optoelectronic behaviors that can be produced by incorporating suitable π-stacking and conductive units into peptide conjugates.Several major themes emerge from the discussion in this review.

        <p>Gel-forming peptide conjugates are sometimes considered to be a type of low molecular weight gelator (LMWG). It will thus be interesting to investigate whether methods developed to predict gelation properties of such molecules are applicable to peptide conjugate gelators, although this mainly concerns organogelation which is not a primary focus of research on peptide-based systems. Due to the complex interplay between intermolecular interactions including π-stacking, hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding, it is hard to envisage a universal de novo predictor for peptide hydrogelation or even aggregation propensity, although this has been examined for all known tripeptide sequences. 235 Machine learning methods hold great future promise in predicting whether a peptide conjugate can form a hydrogel, as demonstrated by work using several machine learning methods. 236 The QSPR (quantitative structure-property relationships) analysis modeling involved training on a set of initial peptide conjugate gelators (including Nap-and Fmoc-peptides and other compounds) and nongelators (represented as SMILES strings), and then predicting the gelation ability of a set of test compounds, for which 9/9 were accurately predicted to gel (based on tests using synthesized compounds). 236 There is also scope to apply cutting-edge simulation techniques to model the aggregation of peptide conjugates, although this requires large scale modeling to capture extended self-assembled structures from relatively large (multiatomic) molecules, so coarse-graining methods are required, as for the modeling of smaller tripeptides. 235 As well as future developments in modeling, we can look forward to further experimental work with bulky units other than those discussed in this review (which actually constitute a rather small subset of potential motifs) with novel structural and functional properties. Distinct and enhanced materials properties (in catalysis, optoelectronics, sensing, and many others) can be expected from the careful design and exploration of peptide conjugates. New directions also beckon in pushing the boundaries of synthetic biology, using responsive peptide conjugates in vivo to functionalize and actuate biological systems, from the cell and beyond.Gel-forming peptide conjugates are sometimes considered to be a type of low molecular weight gelator (LMWG).
