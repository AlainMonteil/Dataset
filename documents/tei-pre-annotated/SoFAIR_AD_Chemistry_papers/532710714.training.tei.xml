        <p>In the version of this article initially published, in the fourth paragraph of the main text, there was a typographical error in the first sentence, now reading in part, "…(see Supplementary Fig. 6 for the phylogenetic relationship of C. roseus and S. nux-vomica)," where Supplementary Fig. 7 was originally cited. The error has been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of the article.</p>
