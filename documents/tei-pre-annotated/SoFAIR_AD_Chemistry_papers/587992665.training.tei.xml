        <p>As a combination of visible light photoredox catalysis and synthetic organic electrochemistry, electrochemically-mediated photoredox catalysis emerged as a powerful synthetic technique in recent years, overcoming fundamental limitations of electrochemistry and photoredox catalysis in the single electron transfer activation of small organic molecules. Herein we report a tunable class of electroactivated photoredox catalyst, tri( para-substituted)biarylamines, that become superoxidants in their photoexcited states even able to oxidize molecules beyond the solvent window limits of cyclic voltammetry (such as polyuorobenzene and triuorotoluene). Furthermore, we demonstrate that precomplexation not only permits the excited state photochemistry of tris( para-substituted)biarylaminium cations to overcome picosecond lifetime, but enables and rationalizes the surprising photochemistry of their higher-order doublet (D n ) excited states, unlocking extremely high oxidative potentials (up to a record-breaking ∼+4.4 V vs. SCE).As a combination of visible light photoredox catalysis and synthetic organic electrochemistry, electrochemically-mediated photoredox catalysis emerged as a powerful synthetic technique in recent years, overcoming fundamental limitations of electrochemistry and photoredox catalysis in the single electron transfer activation of small organic molecules.

        <p>Synthetic Organic Electrochemistry (SOE) 1 and visible light PhotoRedox Catalysis (PRC), 2 which oer entries to single electron transfer (SET) chemistry and radical intermediates under mild conditions, have risen to the fore of contemporary organic synthesis. A key factor underpinning the success of PRC is the host of available photocatalyst structures with wellcharacterized photophysical and redox data, allowing chemists to 'tune' a given excited state to a desired process. Although PRC exhibits a selectivity benefit in transferring visible light photon energy to a colored transition metal-based or organic dye photocatalysts, its scope of applications are partially redox potential-limited by this photon energy (ca. 1.8-3.1 eV). Multiple-photon-accumulation strategies such as consecutive photoelectron transfer (conPET) 3 and triplet-triplet annihil-ation upconversion (TTA-UC) 4 have proven elegant means to achieve powerful SET reductions, but their use in oxidations has eluded chemists. A limiting restriction in conPET is that both ground and radical ion states must be photoactive. Furthermore, net-oxidative/reductive PRC processes employ excess of a sacrificial oxidant/reductant which is necessary for photocatalyst turnover, but which may (or whose by-products may) (i) interfere with downstream chemistry and (ii) require separation.Synthetic Organic Electrochemistry (SOE) 1 and visible light PhotoRedox Catalysis (PRC), 2 which oer entries to single electron transfer (SET) chemistry and radical intermediates under mild conditions, have risen to the fore of contemporary organic synthesis.

        <p>In comparison to PRC processes, SOE can employ uncapped potentials to chemical redox reactions at the turn of a dial. However, electrode surfaces typically 5 cannot discriminate between organic molecules aside from their innate order of thermodynamic redox potentials. Moreover, low electrical conductivity in organic solvents typically require applied potentials to be much higher than the target substrate's redox potential. 6 This encourages deleterious redox processes, such as those involving solvent especially if target SET processes lie near the electroactive window (typically ca. +3 to -3 V). 6,7 In addition, mechanistic characterization of the heterogeneous electrolysis step (heterogeneous SET at the electrode surface) 8 has remained a key challenge in SOE. Screening of electrode materials is inevitable, despite eorts to characterize materials by overpotential, resistivity, surface area, stability and cost. 9 As a result of these limitations, synthetic photoelectochemistry is emerging as a state-of-the-art in SET-mediated chemistry. [10][11][12] Dierent categories for the merger of photoand electrochemistry have been reported, including interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) involving photoelectrodes 13 and decoupled photoelectrochemistry (dPEC) where photo-and electrochemical steps serve distinct mechanistic roles. 14 A third category involves an intimate and synergistic relationship of photo-and electrochemical steps within the same catalytic cycle. Xu, 15a,b Lambert, 15c Lin 15d and Ackermann 15e reported elegant examples using electrochemistry to turnover spent photoredox catalysts thus obviating the need for sacrificial oxidants/reductants. This category can also electrogenerate photocatalysts to achieve super-oxidations or super-reductions beyond those accessible via photocatalysis alone. 16 A variety of nomenclature has been coined for this sub-category: "electrophotocatalysis" 16e "photoelectrocatalysis" 16f and "electronprimed photoredox catalysis". 16g We coined nomenclature "electrochemically-mediated PhotoRedox Catalysis (e-PRC)" as a blanket term to cover both net-oxidative/net-reductive variants 10 and to avoid any misunderstanding with iPEC (Fig. 1A). In the net-oxidative direction, Moutet and Reverdy achieved the first e-PRC bimolecular cyclization of 1,1-diphenylethylene using phenothiazine (PTZ) as catalyst (Fig. 1C andE), but utilized UV light and only a few catalyst turnovers were repor-ted. 16a Recently, Lambert reported an exotic trisaminocyclopropenium cation (TAC) as an e-PRCat for Nicewicz-type oxidative coupling. Chloro-, dichloro-and fluorobenzene, typically beyond reach of photoredox catalysis alone, could be engaged (Fig. 1C andE). 16e In context of these seminal reports, a class of e-PRC catalyst that oers tunability, to provide more powerful potentials or new handles for selectivity, is highly attractive.In comparison to PRC processes, SOE can employ uncapped potentials to chemical redox reactions at the turn of a dial.

        <p>Tri( p-substituted)arylamines, discovered by Walter and coworkers 17 are renowned for their photophysical properties as hole-transport materials in OLEDs and in photovoltaics, 18 as oxidative mediators in SOE 19,20 and as oxidants in radical chain reactions. 21 They exhibit fully reversible 1e -oxidations by cyclic voltammetry. Generally colorless in their neutral state, their oxidized tris( para-substituted)aminium radical cation forms are intensely colored. While the commercial tris (4-bromophenyl)aminium radical cation presents issues in synthesis, 22 better behaved radical cations derive from tri ( para-substituted)biarylamines (TPAs) that are easily be prepared in a single/few steps from Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of tri-p-bromophenylamine with appropriate partners or after appropriate activation. Barham reported the use of tris ( para-substituted)arylaminium radical cations bearing p-Me or p-Ph substituents that exhibited good solution stability and excellent stability as isolated solids, that mediated highly selective N-CH 3 oxidative functionalizations. 23 Given their favorable properties and facile synthetic accessibility, we foresaw TPAs as a suitable class of customizable e-PRC catalyst that would open new avenues to customize redox and photophysical parameters of e-PRCats. Moreover, the excellent stability of isolated TPA •+ s could be leveraged in photophysical and mechanistic characterization. Herein, we disclose TPAs as powerful and eective e-PRCats (up to E p ox (*Ar 3 N •+ /Ar 3 N) ∼ +4.3 V vs. SCE) that engage unactivated or electron-poor aromatic systems (E p ox = +2.1 V to &gt;3.0 V) in SET oxidation (Fig. 1D andE). Of key importance is the first discovery of precomplexation in the ground state (Fig. 1B), which (i) circumvents ultrashort lifetimes of excited states, (ii) allows engagement of higher order excited states and (iii) enables contra-thermodynamic redox selectivity.

        <p>We began by screening dierent TPA e-PRCats (Generation 1, Fig. 2) with dierent half-wave oxidation potentials in the Nicewicz model reaction; 24 the oxidative C-H amination of mesitylene (E p ox = +2.1 V vs. SCE) 24 with pyrazole (Table 1). After setting an anodic constant potential of U cell = +1.4 V (Fig. 3), color developed in the anodic compartments for each TPA e-PRCat, consistent with the expected formation of their TPA •+ s. Gratifyingly, irradiation under the specified conditions aorded C-H activation product 3aa. Control reactions in absence of light, potential or e-PRCat confirmed the operation of e-PRC. Interestingly, tri([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amine (TpBPA) aorded a notably higher yield of 3aa than the commercial tris (4-bromophenyl)amine (entry 4) despite having an appreciably lower E 1/2 . After further optimization, using MeOH as proton source, carbon foam as WE and copper as CE gave the best result (entry 8). The yield of 3aa tracked well with increasing applied constant potential (Fig. 3). For full optimization studies, see the ESI. † With optimal conditions in hand, the amination of arenes with a variety of pharmaceutically-relevant N-heterocycles was explored (Table 2). Halide-bearing and carbonyl (aldehyde, ketone and ester)-bearing pyrazoles, triazole, benzotriazole, and a functionalized derivative of benzimidazole aorded generally good to excellent (50-89%) yields of aminated mesitylenes 3aa-3aj. We note that benzimidazole derivatives have not been reported as nucleophiles in previous photoelectrochemical arene amination or conPET photocatalytic methods. 13d,16e,25 6-Chloro-2-fluoropurine aorded a modest yield of 3ak (32%). Xylenes and toluene were tolerated to aord 3bb-3fb in moderate to excellent (30-88%) yields. Interestingly, the reactivity trend of xylenes followed the order Table 2 e-PRC C-H heteroaminations using TpBPA meta-&gt; ortho-&gt; para-xylene, despite E p ox following the opposite trend (see Mechanistic Study). 26 Toluene has a higher E p ox than xylenes but reacted to give 81% of 3eb. 26 Bromobenzene aorded a 30% yield of 3fb with notable r.s.m., while iodobenzene gave no reaction (60% r.s.m.). Benzene and PhCl were unsuccessful, presumably due to their notably higher E p ox (only a 10% yield of 3gb was obtained, even with 72 h and an excess of PhCl). CE Substitution of Cu for Pt wire cathode and substitution of MeOH for AcOH increased the yield to 35% (Table 3). We could not improve the yield beyond this threshold. Leveraging the facile customization of TPAs, we synthesized TpBPA derivatives (Fig. 4) with electron-withdrawing groups to bolster their TPA •+ excited state potentials (entries 1-4). Of these, tris(4′-cyano-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amine (TCBPA) increased the yield of 3gb to 46% (Table 3). In contrast to TpBPA, the optimal TCBPA catalyst loading was 5 mol% (entries 4-8), increasing the yield of 3gb to 69% (entry 6). Notably, the reaction was still ecient with only 1.5 mol% of TCBPA (entry 8). Under optimal conditions, reactions of PhCl, benzene and even fluorobenzene were enabled, aording 3gb-3ib in modest to good (30-65%) yields (Table 4). Our conditions tolerated free carboxylic acids (3hm), prone to decarboxylation under typical PRC. Interestingly, under the same applied constant potential U cell as in Table 2 and in contrast to the use of TpBPA, here toluene underwent benzylic oxidation instead of amination, while a pyrazole-4-carboxaldehyde underwent oxidation to give ultimately 3hm. Bromobenzene gave a lower yield of 3fb than in Table 2. These observations indicate a less oxidizing TPA •+ excited state (*TpBPA •+ ) is beneficial for certain substrates and demonstrates the value of tunability presented by this class of e-PRCats. We further probed the limits of arene SET oxidations with TCBPA •+ , by targeting 1,2-dichlorobenzene and trifluorotoluene, and were encouraged to detect products, albeit in low yields, when using TCBPA (17% of 3jb and 7%, respectively).

        <p>Neutral TpBPA possesses a strong absorption at λ max = 365 nm, where TpBPA •+ absorbs poorly. Performing our optimized synthetic procedure for 3aa with 365 nm LEDs aorded only 11%, suggesting photoexcitation of neutral TpBPA is not a dominant mechanistic factor. The aforementioned control reaction without applied potential aorded only 4% of 3aa. In contrast to TpBPA, TCBPA does absorb appreciably at 395 nm. Nevertheless, in the absence of an applied potential for the optimized synthesis of 3gb, only a 12% yield of 3gb was observed. The very substantial yield dierences when applied potential is present or absent confirm the pivotal role of the TPA •+ s and e-PRC as the main product-forming pathway. Inspecting the UV-visible absorption spectra of TpBPA •+ and TCBPA •+ , we reasoned the longest wavelength bands (λ max at ca. 719 and 856 nm, respectively) must contain their D 0 → D 1 transitions. Based on the photochemical interpretation of Kasha's rule that prohibits photochemistry from higher order excited states, we irradiated the reactions forming 3aa and 3gb with 740 nm and 850 nm and were mystified to observe no reaction in either case (Fig. 6). That successful reaction was only observed at 395 nm implicated anti-Kasha behavior; a higher-order excited state participating in SET photooxidation. Such behavior is as surprising as it is intriguing, since (i) not only are examples of photochemistry violating Kasha's rule rarely reported in organic synthesis 3b,c,28,29 but (ii) the reported lifetimes of photoexcited radical ion species are already ultrashort. 30 In fact, despite a number of conPET/e-PRC reports invoking their photochemistry in super-oxidations/reductions, the question of how photoexcited radical ion species could ever participate in photochemical processes has eluded chemists. The ultrashort lifetimes of these species lie beneath timescales of diusion-controlled bimolecular quenching. 10 Greatly aiding our mechanistic study was the fact that TPA •+ s can be isolated as bench stable PF 6 salts. 23 Their crystal structures revealed a common propeller-type structure consistent with parent TPAs (Fig. 7). However, attempts to investigate quenching of photoexcited TPA •+ s were thwarted by the fact that they do not exhibit steady-state fluorescence (see ESI †).

        <p>Precomplexation could rationalize productive, unimolecular SET and the aforementioned anti-Kasha behaviour. Presuming that precomplexes may possess dierent UV-vis absorptions than their parent TPA •+ s, we investigated quenching of the absorption of TPA •+ s in the presence of representative concentrations of arenes (Fig. 9). In the presence of mesitylene however, the spectrum of TpBPA •+ was unchanged. Gratifyingly, irradiation with 395 nm light eected gradual conversion of TpBPA •+ to TpBPA, corroborating the expected SET from mesitylene to the photoexcited TPA •+ . Interestingly and in contrast, the spectrum of TCBPA •+ was altered by PhCl; a small bathochromic perturbation of the peak at 384 nm to 395 nm occurred. Irradiation with 395 nm completely converted TCBPA •+ to TCBPA after minutes.Precomplexation could rationalize productive, unimolecular SET and the aforementioned anti-Kasha behaviour.

        <p>Given the paramagnetic nature of TPA •+ s, we reasoned that a change in their EPR spectra in the presence of representative arene concentrations would be more conclusive in corroborating precomplexation. The EPR signal of TpBPA •+ showed a triplet (a N = 8.9 G). Addition of mesitylene to TpBPA •+ caused its EPR signal to shift (ΔB = 4.5 G) to lower G values (Fig. 10), but the signal shape was largely unchanged. This indicates that the spin density of the TpBPA •+ is largely unaected when it undergoes precomplexation with mesitylene. A less pronounced shift in G value occurred in the presence of iodobenzene (ΔB = 2.0 G) but flattening of the triplet shoulders was observed (see ESI †). Based on these spectroscopic dierences, we hypothesize that a dierent type of precomplex occurs in this case that is 'unreactive', to rationalize the inability to engage this substrate under the reaction conditions despite its more accessible redox potential (E p ox = +2.07 vs. SCE) than toluene (E p ox = +2.28 V vs. SCE). 33 In contrast to TpBPA •+ , simulated fitting of the EPR signal from TCBPA •+ revealed two radical species, one triplet and one superimposed singlet appearing as a large broad central feature. We presume TCBPA •+ exists as a mixture of rotamers in solution, one propeller-type as observed in the solid state, and one in which a biphenyl unit falls into conjugation with the N radical cation, consistent with reported behaviour for similar compounds. 34,35 Addition of PhCl caused a notable change in the signal shape, giving exclusively the triplet signal (Fig. 11), consistent with the change in UV-vis (Fig. 9) and indicating that the spin density of TCBPA •+ is notably aected by precomplexation with PhCl. A similar change was detected upon addition of 1,2-dichlorobenzene, but not for its 1,4-congenor (17% yield of 3jb vs. 6% yield of 3lb under TCPBA e-PRC) and not for PhBr (22% of 3fb from TCPBA e-PRC) which instead all gave spectra clearly favoring the 'unreactive' complex (singlet signal). 36 Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations modelled precomplexation of various TPA •+ /arene combinations (Table 6). For unsymmetrical (halo)arene substrates, orientations of the complex with halogen facing both 'in' to the N radical cation and 'out' were explored (see ESI † for full investigations). We assumed that π-stacking interactions 37 at the TPA •+ 's biphenyl unit could be responsible for precomplexation. Attempts to position PhCl or mesitylene substrates in a sandwich or parallel-displaced π-π stacking interaction ("π-π" complex) around the inner N-bearing ring of their respective TPA •+ s led to dissociation, whereas positioning of the substrates around the terminal aromatic ring identified local minima resembling T-type stacking interaction ("T-π" complexes). For this complex, minimal change in the spin density was detected for TpBPA •+ + mesitylene (Fig. 12), whereas a large shift in spin density occurred for TCBPA •+ + PhCl where the Cl atom was facing inwards (Fig. 13). This is consistent with the changes in EPR and UV-vis spectra, and so we assigned this T-π complex as the one responsible for the triplet EPR signal and successful reactivity, since. On the other hand, for less successful substrate PhBr and unsuccessful PhI (no product, 60% recovered 2b), a π-π complex was presumed to be responsible for the broad singlet EPR signal. Delocalization of the N radical cation over the biphenyl aromatic system would lead to stabilization, presumably decreasing E p ox of the photoexcited TPA •+ . Free energies of precomplexation were endergonic at the levels of theory employed, 38 this was confirmed to be a result of the implicit solvation model (see ESI †). It is most important to consider relative trends. Intermolecular distances for T-π stacking and π-π stacking were close to previously-reported distances for simpler complexes/dimers. [39][40][41] Fig. 11 EPR spectra of the TCBPA •+ with reactive (left) and unreactive (right) substrates (350 eq.).Given the paramagnetic nature of TPA •+ s, we reasoned that a change in their EPR spectra in the presence of representative arene concentrations would be more conclusive in corroborating precomplexation. The EPR signal of TpBPA •+ showed a triplet (a N = 8.9 G). Addition of mesitylene to TpBPA •+ caused its EPR signal to shift (ΔB = 4.5 G) to lower G values (Fig. 10), but the signal shape was largely unchanged. This indicates that the spin density of the TpBPA •+ is largely unaected when it undergoes precomplexation with mesitylene.

        <p>Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations investigated the energies of higher order excited D n states for TpBPA •+ , TCBPA •+ and TdCBPA •+ , using both CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and ωB97XD/6-31+G (d,p). 31a,42 The calculated UV-visible spectra of TpBPA •+ and TCBPA •+ in MeCN reasonably agreed with experimental spectra (Fig. 14). The broad visible band (ca. 580-850 nm) is known to result from symmetry breaking 35a of the first excited state D E in solution and in the excited state to give the D 1 and D 2 states, meaning TD-DFT transitions of the 580-850 nm region were less accurate than those of higher order excitations. Canonical molecular orbital (MO) calculations 31a,43 revealed that excited states involved HOMO-'n' to SOMO transitions, typical of hole-particle excitations (Fig. 15A). 16e,31a Due to the complexity in interpretation of Canonical MO transitions of higher excited state transitions, Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) were employed to visualize the changes in 'hole density'. 44 For all TPA •+ s studied, the first (and second) excited states (D 0→ D E→ D 1,2 ) involved π → π* transitions around the core aromatics, while the higher order excited states (D 0→ D n ) corresponding to 395 nm involved π → π* transitions around the peripheral aromatics (Fig. 15B). The concentration of 'hole density' at peripheral aromatics is exactly where it would be in closest proximity to substrate arenes in reactive T-π precomplexes. Ruling out participation of the first two excited states and states accessed at wavelengths &lt;380 nm, we predict 'eective maximum' excited state potentials of TpBPA •+ at +4.02 V, TCBPA •+ at +4.19 V and TdCBPA •+ at +4.41 V vs. SCE from the Rehm-Weller equation. 45 A mechanism is proposed consistent with spectroscopic and computational studies herein (Fig. 16). Anodic SET oxidation generates the TPA •+ from its TPA. Photoexcitation of the TPA •+ to its D 1 /D 2 or higher D n states followed by bimolecular SET reductive quenching is prohibited by the TPA •+ 's picosecond lifetime. Instead, preassociation occurs to give a reactive T-π or an unreactive π-π precomplex (PRCX), depending on the sterics of the arene substrate. 46,47 In the latter case, conjugative stabilization of the N radical cation decreases E p ox of the *TPA •+ below the threshold for productive unimolecular SET such that photoexcitation of the PRCX leads simply to non-radiative photophysical relaxation processes (such as internal conversion). In the former case, photoexcitation of the PRCX yields unimolecular SET reductive quenching of the *TPA •+ , regenerating the TPA and generating the arene radical cation to be intercepted by the N-heterocyclic nucleophile 2b followed by loss of protons and further SET (anodic or by the TPA •+ ) to yield product 3. The prerequisite for precomplexation rationalizes the typical requirement for an excess of arene (3.5 eq. up to 1 mL, ∼40 eq. herein) to drive precomplexation equilibrium in arene amination reactions mediated by radical cations. 15c,16eTime-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations investigated the energies of higher order excited D n states for TpBPA •+ , TCBPA •+ and TdCBPA •+ , using both CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and ωB97XD/6-31+G (d,p). 31a,42 The calculated UV-visible spectra of TpBPA •+ and TCBPA •+ in MeCN reasonably agreed with experimental spectra (Fig. 14).

        <p>We report tri(p-substituted)biarylamines (TPAs) as a novel class of tunable, electroactivated photoredox catalyst. Photoexcited tris (p-substituted)biarylaminium radical cations (TPAs •+ ) are demonstrated as highly potent SET oxidants. Straightforward customization of TPAs allows tuning of UV-vis absorptions, redox potentials and handles for precomplexation within the TPAs •+ . We report the first evidence of dispersion controlled (π-stacking) precomplexation in synthetic photoelectrochemistry and in the photochemistry of excited radical ions, which serves as a unique control element. Precomplexation enables remarkable photochemical phenomena: (i) circumvention of the ultrashort lifetimes of excited radical ion states for their use in photocatalysis, (ii) anti-Kasha fashion engagement of higher-order excited states in photocatalysis, (iii) overturning of thermodynamic selectivity dictated by redox potentials by virtue of steric/electronic factors involved in the precomplex. We are excited to witness future opportunities in reactivity and selectivity that dispersion precomplexation may provide to photocatalysis, in addition to recent developments in the control of photochemical outcomes through confined spaces and ordering of solvent.
