        <p>Herein, we report the successful synthesis of Co 9 S 8 metal-sulfide nanowire trapped in multi walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), which was subsequently found to be an effective catalyst for water splitting. Melamine pyrolysis together with a Co precursor results in MWCNTs, with the addition of sulfur during synthesis enhancing the surface area, pore size, and oxygen vacancy defects in the nanotubes. The hierarchical structure of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT products boosted the electron mobility and mass transport for both the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. Doping the catalyst surface with Pyridinic-N atoms, Graphitic-N atoms and thioamide S-atoms dramatically improved the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance by lowering the overpotentials for OER and HER reactions. The Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT generated a current density of 10 mAcm -2 water-splitting current by applying a cell voltage of only 1.5 V. Further, Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT showed excellent stability. The mechanism of Co 8 S 9 nanowire formation in the MWCNT was also investigated.</p>
        <p>Current worldwide demand to reduce the usage of unsustainable fossil fuels to overcome the alarming rise in global warming gained a wide scientific attention to look for cleaner alternatives. A diversion to cleaner energy forms offers long term advantages that are not possible with the conventional energy sources such as coal, oil, and gas. In the last decade, many studies has been conducted to develop new energy storage systems and conversion technologies such as fuel cells, metal air batteries and water splitting devices [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] . The activity and efficiency of the chemical transformation on these renewable devices are governed by the electrocatalyst driving the conversion reaction. Electrochemical water splitting involves two-cell reactions; hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a reliable pathway for the generation of hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. Both the reactions require an overall thermodynamic potential of minimum 1.23 V to proceed with a successful overall water splitting. However, practically, the kinetic hindrance requires extra potential to drive the reaction and the over-all system becomes costlier limiting its practical application [9][10][11][12][13][14] . It is highly recommended to develop out-standing electrocatalysts to overcome the current sluggish kinetics without compromising the stability.</p>
        <p>The state-of-the-art shows Ir, Ru and their derivatives offering good activity for OER and Pt based material exhibiting the most active performance for HER; however their scarcity, high cost and severe operating condition hamper the commercial application in large scale [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] . Transition metal based electrocatalysts gained research attention owing to the low cost and large-scale availability. Numerous studies have been devoted on transition metal alloys, oxides, and carbides as bifunctional electrocatalysts [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35] . Nevertheless, the transition-metal catalysts alone suffer from intrinsically low electron conductivity limiting their performance towards high current densities. To overcome this, some conductive materials such as carbon nanomaterials, graphene layers or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are commonly employed as effective supports for the transition metal catalyst. Even though, these carbonaceous materials alone are not known to have high activity for most of the electrochemical reactions, their electrochemical performance can be further improved by doping some heteroatoms such as boron, nitrogen or phosphorous [31 , 32] . These carbonaceous materials can act either as an active metal-free electrocatalyst or as an efficient catalyst support for the active metal nanoparticles that generate synergistic catalytic activity. Among the different types of heteroatoms being used, nitrogen gained a great attention due to the low cost, durability and unique structure. The electronic and chemical properties of N-doped CNTs significantly changes the induced property of the asymmetric spin density and local charge density of the carbon lattices, thereby altering the reaction route resulting in an improved surface chemical reactivity of HER and OER mechanism [36] . Various studies show that pyridinic nitrogen serves as a promising active site for OER and ab initio calculations proved that N doped CNTs increases the Fermi Level at donor state to facilitate the emission of large current at lower applied voltage [37 , 38] .</p>
        <p>Recently, transition metal sulfides are found to be highly tolerable to oxidation environment than transition metal alloys, phosphides, and nitrides [39] . Metal sulfides demonstrated prominent electrochemical properties due to their unique physio-chemical properties such as thermal and electrical conductivity, mechanical and thermal stability. Cobalt sulfides (Co 3 S 4 , CoS 2 , Co 9 S 8 , Co 1-x S) show a great potential in hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis applications [40][41][42][43] . Particularly, Co 9 S 8 is found to be as a promising electrocatalyst with exceptional properties in the microchemical interface of the catalysts due to its good durability and outstanding redox capability in alkaline medium. The electrochemical activity of Co 9 S 8 can be improved through proper doping, tuning morphology, incorporating functional materials or substrates. Anchoring Co 9 S 8 over doped CNTs plays a synergistic effect to improve the overall electron conductivity, which enhances the electrocatalytic properties [44 , 45] .</p>
        <p>Liu and coworkers synthesized hierarchical Co 9 S 8 hollow microplates using sulfurization and calcination process that exhibits remarkable performance for oxygen evolution reaction with low over potential (278 mV) to reach 10 mAcm -2 with low Tafel slope (53 mVdec -1 ) and excellent stability [46] . Nanda and team, followed a green and environment-friendly pyrolysis method for the successful synthesis of metal-rich sulfide anchored over N-doped nanocarbon network in absence of S 2 -ions that show excellent OER activity when compared to commercial RuO 2 [47] . Yuan et al. fabricated Co@Co 9 S 8 nanochain with core-shell morphology using direct-current arc-discharge technique followed by sulfurization at 200 °C. The Co nanochain acts as a conductive network that injects electron to Co 9 S 8 and enhances the OER performance significantly by reducing the overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction [48] . Feng and co-workers prepared carbon armored Co 9 S 8 nanoparticles through the direct thermal treatment of cobalt nitrate and trithiocyanuric acid mixture heated upto 700 °C under N 2 flow. The Co 9 S 8 @C exhibits excellent HER activity and durability over both extreme condition of acidic and basic medium with 100% faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution [49] . Zhuo and coworkers reported the preparation of Co 9 S 8 using electrochemical deposition technique and its incorporation with MoS x using single step sulfurization method. They studied the effect of small amount of MoS x on the electrocatalyst HER activity of Co 9 S 8 . Moreover, Co 9 S 8 -30@MoS x /CC was found to be the excellent catalyst towards HER with a low overpotential of -98 mV at 10 mAcm -2 along with a low Tafel slope and outstanding stability [50] . Li et al. designed Co 9 S 8 /CNFs membrane by combining electrospinning and chemical vapor deposition that shows excellent activity and stability for HER/OER. The onion like graphene layer wrapped around the nanoparticles not only enhances the electrical conductivity but also prevent the degradation of particle during electrocatalysis and thereby enhances the stability [51] . Liu and researchers synthesized Co 9 S 8 @N,P-doped porous carbon (Co 9 S 8 @NPC) using lowtemperature phosphorization method with Co 9 S 8 @N-doped porous carbon as a precursor that was prepared using a one-step moltensalt calcination method. Co 9 S 8 @NPC displays good activity towards OER/HER and was used simultaneously for cathode and anode catalyst for the generation of hydrogen and oxygen with 100% faradaic efficiency [52] . Inspired by the above observation, our aim is to develop ultrafast, economical, and scalable method for the syn-thesis of Co 8 S 9 anchored over carbon network that would enhance the electronic conductivity. There are some reports available in literature on the N-doped CNTs embedded with transition metal nano-catalyst that show high electrocatalytic activity [44 , 45] . In this work we focus on the mechanism of formation of Co 9 S 8 metal-sulfide nanowire trapped in multi walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and compare its intrinsic effect towards electrocatalytic activity with respect to Co based catalyst without sulfur doping.</p>
        <p>In this work we followed melamine assisted pyrolysis in presence of metal salt for the synthesis nanoparticles incorporated Ndoped CNTs and investigate their electrochemical property for HER, OER and overall water splitting. Melamine was not only the source of carbon but also provided N atoms for doping over the graphene network. Furthermore, the mechanism of CNT formation in presence of Co nanoparticle is also proposed on the basis of the characterization as well as from previous reports.</p>
        <p>Cobalt nitrate (0.5 g, 99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), melamine (4 g, 99%, Sigma Aldrich), thioamide (1 g, ≥ 99.0%, Sigma Aldrich) and ethanol was provided by BDH Middle East LLC. All reagents were used as received without any further step of purification. A 0.5 g of cobalt nitrate and 4 g of melamine and 1 g of thioamide was uniformly mixed using a hand motor for 10-15 min. The mixture was loaded in a quartz boat and placed inside a horizontal calcination furnace for pyrolysis at 900 °C for 2 h at a ramp of 4 °C/min under continuous N 2 flow (10 sccm). The obtained sample was alternately washed with DI water, ethanol and acetone to remove undue metal and unwanted elements. The washed sample was then filtered and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for overnight. Thus obtained final product was names as Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT. Another sample, Co/CNT without sulfur, was also prepared for electrochemical activity comparison.</p>
        <p>Crystalline nature of the synthesized particles were measured using PANanalytical (Empyrean) with a scan range of 10-90 °with a step size of 0.013 °at 0.154056 nm wavelength of Cu-K α radiation. Crystal structure of synthesized particle was modeled using 
            <rs type="software">VESTA</rs> software package. Diffraction peaks were analyzed and identified using HighScore Plus coupled with the XRD equipment. AimSizer (AS-3012) BET area analyzer was used to identify the surface area, pore size and pore volume of the synthesized catalysts. Nova Nano 450, FEI, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with magnification up to 200 kx along with EDX was used to identify the morphology and elemental composition. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200X) coupled with FEI SuperX EDS system was used to identify the particle size, structure, and phase composition. Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used to identify the bonding configuration, elemental composition and their oxidation states. Raman spectrometer (DXR Thermoscientific) was used for the detailed analysis of carbon formed within the range of 10 cm -1 to 40 0 0 cm -1 with the step size of 1.5 cm -1 and step time of 20 s at a wavelength of 514.53 nm.

        <p>HER and OER analysis was conducted with PINE instrument bipotentiostat (Wave Driver 20) on a 3-cell electrode system in 1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte at room temperature. The electrode system consists of a 5 mm glassy carbon disk supported over Teflon mounting as a working electrode, Pt coil (99.9%) mounted at the end of a chemically resistant epoxy rod as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (4 M saturated KCl) as a reference electrode. Typically the procedure for preparing working electrode is as follows: A 5 mg of catalyst and a 30 μL Nafion (0.125% as a binder) was mixed well with a 300 μL of isopropyl alcohol followed by 30 min sonication. A 5 μL of the catalyst ink was dropped slowly over the glassy carbon disk and allowed to dry it at room temperature. The Nernst equation (E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.197 + 0.0591 × pH) was used to convert all potential reported into standard reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Prior to the experiment, a 120 mL of 1 M KOH was completely purged with N 2 (20 sccm) in order to remove the unwanted contaminants. The working electrode was electrochemically pretreated with 100 reduction/oxidation cycle between 0.4 to -1 V at a scan rate of 500 mVs -1 to make the catalyst surface stable. The electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts was measured using Cyclic Voltammogram (CV), Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) and Chronoamperometry (CA).</p>
        <p>The Faradaic efficiency of the electrocatalyst for OER was obtained using a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) setup, where the catalyst loaded on the central disk electrode generates oxygen (as a result of oxygen evolution reaction) and the surrounding Pt ring electrode maintained at a fixed potential (ORR potential) collects the generated oxygen and reduces it (oxygen reduction potential). A 1 M KOH solution was purged with N 2 for 30 min to get rid of any dissolved oxygen prior to the experiments. The disk electrode was scanned between 1.5 to 1.6 V vs RHE with an electrode rotation of 1600 rpm, while the Pt ring electrode was held at a constant potential of 0.4 V RHE in order to rapidly reduce the oxygen evolved from the disk. The faradaic efficiency can be calculated using the equation;</p>
        <p>Where I r and I d are the measured ring and disk currents respectively, and N denotes the collection efficiency (taken as 0.24 here) [53][54][55] . The value 2 denotes the apparent number of electrons and be reported as 2 for electrode at 1600 rpm. Moreover, the RRDE measurement helps to identify the mechanistic pathway for oxygen evolution reaction by fixing the potential of ring at 1.4 V and measuring the current at ring disk to detect the presence of H 2 O 2 oxidation.</p>
        <p>Zahner Elektrik IM6 was used to measure the electrochemical impedance analysis at different potentials with frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 5 mV. The impedance components were extracted using Thales, Equivalent Circuit Simulation &amp; Model Fit (SIM).</p>
        <p>The overall water splitting was conducted in a two-electrode system with anode and cathode as Co/CNT (or Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT) catalyst. The electrode was fabricated using carbon cloth (1 cm x 3 cm) pretreated twice using HNO 3 (0.1 M), ethanol (0.1 M) and DI water alternately. Typically, a 3 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a mixture of DI water (1 mL), isopropyl alcohol (0.5 mL) and Nafion solution (0.03 mL) by sonication for 30 min. A 35 μL of thus prepared ink was dropped carefully on both the side of 1 cm x 1 cm portion of carbon cloth and allowed to dry in an oven kept at 40 °C. The prepared electrode was used in a two-cell electrode system to perform the polarization curve measurement in N 2 saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte.</p>
        <p>XRD patterns for Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT are shown in along with metallic Co. The strong peak at 2 θ = 26.05 °corresponds to the (002) plane of graphene layer, which is present in both Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT confirming the formation of CNTs during the pyrolysis of melamine. The possibility of metal-carbide formation is there, as the peak at 44.2 °corresponds to Co 3 C and 44.6 °belongs to metallic Co. A prospect of overlapping of these peaks exists and an XPS analysis will be used to further confirm the existence of metal-carbide on the surface [56] . Crystal structures of Co and Co 9 S 8 in Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT respectively confirm a cubic crystal structure with Fm3m space group in both catalysts, where the unit cell parameter of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT and Co/CNT were calculated to be 978.56 Å and 44.7 Å respectively. The presence of sulfur during synthesis increase the cubic volume by approximately 144% than the initial value. N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm method (Figure S1.a) was used to calculate the specific surface area, pore size and pore volume of as-synthesized particles. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT was measured to be 65.7 m 2 g -1 and 78.2 m 2 g -1 , respectively. A distribution of pore size and pore volume obtained from BJH (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) method in Figure S1.b shows an average pore radius of 1.9 nm and 1.94 nm respectively for Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT. The pore volume of Co/CNT was measured to be 0.346340 cc/g, while that of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT was 0.475201 cc/g. The significant increase in the surface area and pore volume in Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT sample is possibly due to the doping of sulfur. The larger specific surface area provides an easier pathway for rapid movement of ions and electrons during catalytic reactions. Moreover, the larger pore volume facilitates a faster diffusion through the sufficient contact of electrolyte to the active surface area and thereby increases the specific capacity and overall electrochemical performance. The morphology of as-prepared Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT samples in Figure S2(a-b) confirm the presence of carbon nanotubes of several nanometer to micrometer length where the metal nanoparticles are encapsulated at the end (bright contrast). The diameter of the carbon nanotubes are similar to that of the particle size, which are in the range of 10 to 25 nm. EDX analysis in Figure S2(c-d) confirm the presence of Co, C, O and N in Co/CNT, and the existence of S (1.35%) suggests a successful doping of S during the pyrolysis in Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT. The presence of N in the elemental composition indicates the incorporation of N over the graphene lattice.</p>
        <p>Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool to analyses the disorderness and degree of graphitization in carbon-based samples. Figure S3 displays the Raman spectrum of as-prepared Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT, with two prominent peaks centered at 1358 and 1592 cm -1 corresponding to the D and G band of carbon respectively. The D band indicates the graphite defects such as vacancies, edge and grain boundaries, where G band corresponds to sp 2 bond of carbon. The crystallinity of the graphite plane can be quantified using the intensity ratios of D and G band centers (I D /I G ), where the value tends to increase with an increase in the edge defect, which is associated with a decrease in the graphite size. The intensity ratio, I D /I G for Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT was calculated to be 0.75 and 0.95 respectively, suggested that the effect of sulfur doping improves the surface carbon defect that possibly enhances the microstructural surface property of the catalyst for electrochemical reactions. The weaker peaks observed around 650 cm -1 indicate the presence of Co (or Co 9 S 8 ) bonded to the carbon network.</p>
        <p>TEM/EDS analysis was used to identify the size, composition and type of carbon formed in the as-synthesized particles. TEM image of Co/CNT in Fig. 2 The particles of semi-spherical shape are bonded with 3-5 layers of graphene sheets as shown in Figure S4. The diffraction spots in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Figure S4 inset confirm the highly crystalline nature of the particles. Moreover, it also consists of more than one diffraction pattern, which are highly likely to arise from the poorly crystallized graphene layer covering the Co nanoparticle. HAADF-STEM image and phase mapping in Fig. 2 (g-i) display a uniform distribution of C and N species across the entire tubular structure, thereby confirming the successful doping of N atoms over the graphene network. Co atoms are dispersed all over the entire CBNT ( Fig. 2 e), and the presence of oxygen on the Co particle are more likely due to the physical absorption of atmospheric oxygen from outside exposure. A discussion on the formation of CBNT and MWCNT is presented in the following section.</p>
        <p>TEM image of as-synthesized Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT in Fig. 3 a shows the presence of carbon in two particular forms, CBNT and MWCNT of several micrometer length. The particle morphology and carbon formation in Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT in presence of sulfur is quite different than Co/CNT synthesized without sulfur. A close observation shows that bamboo kind carbon tubes consist of hemi-spherical Co/Co 9 S 8 particles of 10-20 nm size dispersed over the bamboo walls and boundaries as shown in Fig. 3 b. However, the particle in MWCNT are neatly filled with extended metal nanowires where the lattice fringes are parallel to the nanotube axis with an elongated teardrop shape as in Fig. 3 c. The majority of Co 9 S 8 nanowire encapsulated with MWCNT are 1-5 μm length and 20-40 nm diame-ter. A detailed examination of MWCNT in Fig. 3 c consists of 18-22 graphene walls on both the sides of tube axis along with some discontinuity or wrinkles on the graphene layer (encircled defects), which could be associated with the substitution of external species such as N or S atoms on the graphitic network. These defects possibly increase the overall active sites in the catalysts. The presence of more defective sites in Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT is evident from the high I D /I G value (Raman spectrum), that moreover facilitate the electron transport capacity and thereby enhances the electrochemical properties. The MWCNT shows an interplanar distance of 0.352 nm, slightly higher than the non-defective CNT with interwall distance of 0.34 nm, which could be due to the existence of highly oriented defective sites on the graphene walls [57] . The HRTEM of the particle shows the crystalline structure, with interplanar distance of 0.578 nm corresponding to the (111) plane of Co 9 S 8 .</p>
        <p>The EDX analysis in Fig. 3 (d-g) shows the presence of Co and S uniformly distributed all over the catalyst confirming the Co 9 S 8 formation. The EDX line mapping of the particle in Figure S6 (inset) further confirms the presence of Co and S in the entire sample, with Co likely to have a slightly higher concentration than S, pointing to the difference in the atomic ratio of Co:S (9:8) in Co 9 S 8 . The phase mapping of metal nanowire in Figure S7 shows the uniformity in Co 9 S 8 formation. To gain further insight, EDX mapping of another area, where bamboo CNTs are more dominant, is shown in Figure S8. The color distribution of Co and S is not very uniform in the bamboo CNT, with some segregated Co areas, indicating the presence of more Co particle along with some Co 9 S 8 nanocomposite.</p>
        <p>This section discusses the mechanism CBNT and MWCNT formation in presence of Co metallic nanowire and Co 8 S 9 nanoparticles, based on the material characterization and previous reports. Large scale production of CNTs, such as, multiwalled CNT (MWCNT), single walled CNT (SWCNT), bamboo CNT (BCNT), carbon nanofibers (CNF) by following catalytic approach is highly promising owing to a better control in the anisotropic dimension, alignment and helicity of the tube structure [58] . The common routes pursued for the catalytic production of CNTs are: a) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and decomposition of lower hydrocar- bons in presence of catalytically active substrate [59 , 60] , b) using polymer precursors activated on metallic nanoparticles [61] , c) synthesis from the pyrolysis of organometallic reagents along with transition metal salt only as a carbon source or additional hydrocarbon as subagents. In this work, we followed the pyrolysis of melamine in presence of cobalt nitrate and thioamide, where melamine was the main source of C and N, and sulfur atoms were provided by thioamide. Ramaprabhu and team, recently reported the structure, morphology and composition change of melamine at different stages of pyrolysis [62] . The thermal decomposition of melamine starts at 390 °C, through the condensation of melamine into melem adducts that are further converted into melon adduct by the elimination of ammonia group from the ring structure. Eventually, the condensation at 500 °C triggers the conversion of melon into polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) as a first stable form. Layered C 3 N 4 resembles graphite which consist of two main structural unit: tri-s-triazine and s-triazine, along with the π conjugated graphitic planes with C and N atoms linked via sp 2 hybridization [63][64][65] . Further increase in temperature above 600 °C decomposes the metastable g-C 3 N 4 and provide the required C and N atoms as the nucleation source of carbon nanotubes. Concurrently, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate undergoes stepwise thermal decomposition into its different hydrates such as tetra-and di-hydrate, and subsequently complete removal of hydrate to form cobalt oxide followed by amorphous metallic phase and further conversion to metallic cobalt [66] . Thus, the presence of metallic nanoparticle catalyzes the nucleation of carbon nanotubes formation. Dia et al. observed the necessity of Co 2 + ions for the formation of well-defined carbon nitride nanotube. They found that without the cobalt particle there is no structural transformation of carbon nitride sheets into carbon nitride nanotube [67] . Thereby, the growth mechanism was termed as 'metal-mediatedgraphitization'. Leonhardt et al. explained the growth mechanism of metal filled CNT similar to the existing vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism, where the growth mode (tip growth or root growth) depends on the contact force between the particle and the substrate surface [68] .</p>
        <p>In-situ growth mechanism is much more complex than ex-situ, as the graphitization of the CNT and the filling of the core with metal nanoparticles occur simultaneously and the nanotube can grow via, either tip mechanism or root mechanism. The growth mechanism of Co 9 S 8 nanowires, microstructure and morphology of the catalyst and CNT are greatly influenced by the vapor concentration of thioacetamide. Memon et al. reported a kinetic study of the thermal decomposition of thio-group compound (thiophene) and they found that at higher temperature the pyrolysis of thioamide group was initiated by the fission of C-S bond [69] that followed the production of a mixture containing C x H y compound and sulfur containing species (eg: H 2 S). Under those conditions, possibly two processes can take place on the surface of the Co catalyst: one is the decomposition and diffusion of C atoms on the surface of the catalyst, and second is the sulfidation of the Co catalyst that resulted in the formation of Co 9 S 8 . The influence of carbon source on catalyst, may result in the carburization of the catalyst in which the metal surface was converted into metal carbide at the grain boundary of the catalyst as evident from the XPS results in the coming section. However, if the rate of carbon formation on the metal is greater than the energy for the formation of metal carbide, there will be a deactivation in the diffusion of carbon atoms from gas phase into the bulk of the catalyst. Thus, the metal carbide become unstable and decompose. This may be the reason why metal-carbide is not identified in the TEM, somehow the presence of metal-carbide is detected from the XPS analysis [70] The mechanism of carbon bamboo CNT (CBNT) is slightly different than discussed above. Lin and co-workers conducted a dynamic observation on the development of bamboo like CNT on Ni catalyst during the decomposition of C 2 H 2 and postulated a gas-solid mechanism on CNT growth [73] . The carbon atoms diffuse into the cobalt nanoparticle and initiate the formation of inner graphene layer. With time, more carbon atoms are added at the end of the graphene layer and Co nanoparticle become asymmetric and the nucleation of carbon atoms takes place at the upper edge of the disordered Co particle. The shape change of the metal catalyst due to the contact interaction takes place above Tammann Temperature (Co-611 °C) and under pressure, that can be in two ways, one is the sintering under pressure and other is the squeezing of the metal nanoparticle under the graphene conical contact pressure [74] . Various authors reported their own findings on the possible mechanisms on the nanoparticle shape change that facilitates the CBNT formation [75][76][77][78] . This initiates the formation of nodes on carbon bamboo nanotube (CBNT). Five to seven graphene layers are added one above another to make the graphene wall thicker and extended around the bottom distorted Co particle. The completed graphene layer makes a hemispherical cap that partition the existing tube internally. During node formation, the elastic elongation of the bottom part of the catalyst increases the effective interface and surface area of the catalyst, that also increases the particle strain energy. Once it reaches the upper limit, particle is ejected from the newly formed bamboo node and the process is repeated to ensure multiple compartments in a single stranded bamboo CNT. The mechanism of CBNT is represented in Scheme 2 .</p>
        <p>To obtain the surface chemical state and elemental composition of Co/ CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted. In the XPS survey spectrum of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT in Figure S9 shows five sharp peaks at 791, 531, 399, 284 and 162 eV attributed to cobalt (Co), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and sulfur (S); whereas the corresponding peak of Sulfur was not seen in Co/CNT survey spectrum. The C and N peaks originate from the CNT substrate and O signal could be from the slight oxidation of Co 9 S 8 or the absorbed water (H 2 O) from atmosphere [79] . The quantitative analysis of XPS survey spectrum in Table S1 shows a consistency in the elemental composition with the EDX analysis in Figure S2. The decrease in C content in Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT, could be due to the sulfur doping that increases the heteroatom defects on the graphene lattice network and decreases the graphitization degree resulting from a decrease in the ordered carbon framework, as evident from Raman spectrum. The high resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p for Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT are shown in Fig. 4 a-b. The Co 2p profile consists of two main spin orbital doublets (Co 2p 3/2 and Co 2p 1/2 ) that are separated with 15.6 eV and two shakeup satellites (denoted as Sat.). In Co/CNT ( Fig. 4 a), the two main peaks at 780.76 eV and 796.2 eV describe the Co 2+ state of cobalt, where Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT ( Fig. 4 b) contain similar peaks with a positive shift to higher binding energy at 781.5 eV and 797.2 eV, along with a weak peak corresponding to Co 3 + at 776.8 eV [79] . The presence of higher oxidation state always facilitates better electron transport and enhances the electrochemical property of the catalyst. In addition, it is worth noting here that there is a positive shift in Co 2p peak of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT when compared to Co/CNT as shown in Figure S10. The peak shift should be due to the strong migration of electron cloud triggered by the high electronegative N or S atoms doped on the CNT substrate that induce strong covalent coupling between the Co species and N doped CNT. Moreover, the incorporation of S atom to the Co lattice enhances the charge transfer between Co and S along with a strong Scheme 2.

        <p>interaction [45] . These intimate hybridizations of electron transfer species in a nanocomposite renders faster charge transportation favoring the electrochemical reactions. Fig. 4 (c-d (graphitic shakeup satellite) respectively [82] . These results manifest that S and N atoms are successfully doped in the carbon framework. Moreover, a minor peak present in Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT at 283.6 eV corresponds to the metal carbide peak, which could be from the interface of nanoparticle/graphene layer as explained in the proposed mechanism. The chemical state of doped N atom can be identified using the high-resolution N 1 s spectrum of Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT as in Figure S11. The three main characteristic peaks centered at 389.9 eV (399.1 eV), 401.2 eV (401.4 eV) and 403.5 eV(403.8 eV) are respectively attributed to the Pyridinic N, Graphitic N and higher oxidation state of N, respectively for Co/CNT (Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT). Pyridinic N bonding originates from the sp 2 hybridized π bonding of N atoms to the two neighboring C atoms (sp 2 hybridized) that contributes one p-electron at the edges (or defects) of graphene network. Graphitic N configuration suggests the bonding of sp 2 hybridized N atoms with three sp 2 hybridized neighboring C atoms. Pyridinic N bond could donate one p electron to the aromatic π bond of the carbon atom, thereby improving the electron conductivity of graphene lattice. Moreover graphitic N promotes a charge delocalization, that improves the chemisorption property of the active sites of the catalyst. It was previously reported that Pyridinic N and Graphitic N play a great role in the catalytic activity, so the doping of N atom to the carbon framework is critical for electrochemical property enhancement. Furthermore, the peak position shows a slight positive shift in each peak of N bonding of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT suggesting a strong interaction through covalent coupling between N -C-transition metal, compared to Co/CNT [83 , 84] .</p>
        <p>The high-resolution spectrum of S 2p for Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT in Figure S12 was fitted into five curves that indicate three different forms of sulfur species. The deconvoluted peaks at 162.1 eV and 163.5 eV can be attributed to S 2p 3/2 and S 2p 1/2 region respectively that originate from the cobalt sulfide. The peak at 165.1 eV can be assigned to the C-S-C and the peaks at 168.6 and 169.9 eV can be related to the high oxidation state of sulfur (due to the incomplete reduction of the sulfate). These results affirm the existence of sulfur atoms doped over the carbon lattices, which generate a spin density through a mismatch of the outer orbitals of carbon and sulfur that act as a synergetic factor for the faster charge transfer in electrochemical reaction.</p>
        <p>While taken together, these XPS results demonstrate the successful formation of heteroatom doped carbon framework (CNTs) covalently coupled with Co 9 S 8 nanoparticles that could improve the electron conductivity and physiochemical properties to favor the overall electrochemical properties significantly.</p>
        <p>HER activities of Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT electrode in 1 M KOH electrolyte was performed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mVs -1 and compared with the commercial Pt/C (20%) electrode as shown in Fig. 5 a. In Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT, it is noteworthy that the steady state current starts to rise beyond -0.1 V and causes a dramatic increase in the current density when sweeping at higher negative potential. As shown in Fig. 5 a, Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT can produce a current density of 10 mAcm -2 at lower overpotential of 200 mV, while for Co/CNT it required 298 mV to attain the same current density. The Tafel slope is another kinetic parameter to evaluate the electrocatalytic mechanism for HER/OER. The linear Tafel plot was measured using the Tafel equation ( η= a + b * log(j)), where j is the current density, a is the exchange current density, b be the Tafel slope and η be the measured over potential. A lower Tafel slope indicates a higher hydrogen evolution at lower overpotentials. Tafel slope of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT (90 mVdec -1 ) is much lower than Co/CNT(152 mVdec -1 ) signifying a more favorable kinetics and faster electron transfer during HER reaction after the sulfur doping. Stability is another most significant pa-rameter to evaluate the quality of the catalyst that can be performed using chronoamperometric (CA) experiments. The CA profile in Fig. 5 c shows that Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT maintain a constant current of 10 mAcm -2 at 200 mV even after 20 h, which indicates a good durability of the catalyst under alkaline medium. The fluctuation of current ( Fig. 5 c, inset) in a tolerable level is due to the evolution of H 2 gas that hinder the passage of electron to some extent. The durability and stability of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT can be further confirmed by 10 0 0 continuous accelerated CV cycle runs and performing the polarization curves before and after the sweep experiments, as displayed in Fig. 5 d. The polarization after 10 0 0 cycle shows only a slight shift in current profile of about 5 mV towards the negative direction, but follows a constant current value during the entire potential sweep, which confirms the excellent stability and durability of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT in HER application. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is carried out to gain more insight on the HER kinetics. The Nyquist plot (Figure S13) shows a greater arc radius in Co/CNT than Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT and confirms that the charge transfer resistance of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT is significantly lower compared to Co/CNT, suggesting a faster charge transfer mechanism owing to greater surface area, larger pore size and unique electronic structure. These finding suggest that Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT can serve as a new category of HER electrocatalyst with exceptional activity and excellent durability.</p>
        <p>Further investigation was conducted to assess the OER performance of Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT in 1 M KOH solution. The LSV profile of OER in Fig. 6 a shows an oxidation peak around 1.3-1.4 V that can be attributed to the oxidation of Co 3 + to its higher oxidation state of Co 4 + as previously reported. However, such an oxidation peak was not seen in Co/CNT electrocatalyst. The anodic current of 10 mAcm -2 recorded on Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT presents a lower onset potential of 1.5 V whereas Co/CNT affords a slightly more positive value at (1.64 V). As shown in Fig. 6 b, the Tafel slope of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT and Co/CNT were 79 mVdec -1 and 103 mVdec -1 respectively. The lower Tafel slope of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT implies its higher OER performance. Stability measurement was conducted on Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT to understand the long-term behavior of the catalysts by performing CA and polarization analysis to assess the stability and durability. Fig. 6 c shows a stable current density with negligible fluctuations upto 20 h at a constant applied potential 1.5 V, and indicates the kinetic performance on Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT catalyst to be highly stable. Furthermore, the LSV curve obtained after 10 0 0 cycles of CV sweeps in Fig. 6 d shows no significant change in the anodic current density before and after CV runs and affirms the robustness of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT as a suitable electrode material in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. However, after 10 0 0 cycles, the oxidation peak around 1.3-1.4 V disappeared due to the complete conversion of Co 3 + to Co 4 + , that improves the electrophilicity of the catalyst surface and promotes the adsorption of nucleophilic species such as OH -for the conversion to OOH -intermediates [80] . Using EIS we evaluated the enhancement in the electron transportation in Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT, where the semicircular diameter of Nyquist plot is much smaller than Co/CNT, owing to lower contact and charge transfer resistance as shown in Fig. 6 d owing to the resistance at catalyst-electrolyte interface, which can be measured from the diameter of the fitted semicircle, more likely to be inversely proportional to the rate of overall charge transfer during OER mechanism. The R s value of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT (5.8 ) was much smaller than Co/CNT (11.6 ), also R ct of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT ( 21) and Co/ CNT (32 ) follows a similar trend resulting with a faster electron transfer and charge kinetics for oxygen evolution reaction on Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT. These results confirmed Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT to be a promising catalyst with superior activity and stability towards OER in alkaline medium. Our findings suggest that excellent performance of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT could have benefited from strongly integrated Co 9 S 8 metallic nanowire on the N doped MWCNT with high electronic conductivity.</p>
        <p>Figure S16.a shows the ring and disk current along with applied disk potential and constant ring potential (0.4 V RHE) of RRDE measurement to estimate the faradaic efficiency of the Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT in 1 M KOH solution. It is observed that the faradaic efficiency is maximum 99.4% at the applied disk potential of 1.50 V and decreases to 66.7% with the increase in potential to 1.60 V. The decrease in the faradaic efficiency towards higher potential is due a decrease in the ratio of ring to disk electrode currents, where the ring electrode effectively collects the large oxygen bubbles formed over the surface of the disk. A similar trend of decrease in the faradaic efficiency at higher potential is reported elsewhere [53][54][55] . The electrode at higher potential shows presence of large bubbles on the disk electrode without completely dissolving the formed oxygen in the electrolyte. In that context, faradaic efficiency of 99% at 1.5 V is considered as the electrocatalyst OER efficiency, by ignoring the decrease in the efficiency at higher po-tential. The current profile in Figure S16.b closely monitors the H 2 O 2 generation at the ring potential held at 1.4 V. There is no detectable current in the ring, which shows that the oxidation of H 2 O 2 does not take place on the ring and no H 2 O 2 species were formed. These results confirm that OER at Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT in 1 M KOH solution proceeds to generate di-oxygen via 4 electron transfer mechanism</p>
        <p>a) Based on the excellent OER and HER results discussed above, dual functionality of our electrode is anticipated. Controlling the spontaneous directional motion of water molecule in nanoscale is critical for the water splitting to generate hydrogen and oxygen. Chen et al. proposed the stiffness gradient on the surface of CNTs that governs the spontaneous directional motion of the water molecule [85] . Water permutation rate is greatly affected by the structure of CNTs and dopant atoms. In 2012, Li et al. studied the water permeation effect over the nitrogen doped CNTs and they found that water-nanotube interaction can be greatly tuned by doping nitrogen atom into the nanotube walls [86] . Although in MWCNTs, number of layers and nanotube type greatly controlled the water transportation behavior towards the active metal species embedded inside the CNTs [87 , 88] .</p>
        <p>We constructed a two-electrode electrolyzer to evaluate the overall water splitting performance of Co/CNT and Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT, by using them as electrodes (both anode and cathode containing the same catalyst) as illustrated in Fig. 7 a. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 7 b, Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT and Co/CNT can deliver a current density of 10 mAcm -2 at room temperature at an applied cell volt- Figure S18 shows the effect of concentration on the overall water splitting reaction over Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT loaded carbon cloth. The applied cell voltage to deliver the current density of 10 mAcm -2 at room temperature shows an inverted volcanic trend that holds 1.65 V, 1.5 V and 1.6 V for 0.1 M, 1 M and 4 M KOH respectively. With an increase in the solute concentration, the diffusion coefficient gets smaller due to an increase in viscosity. However, the activity of the catalyst in a neutral solution is comparatively low, which shows that water splitting is limited in normal water and requires an ionic medium for the charge transportation. Electrolyte engineering for OER and HER apparently improve the overall water splitting by enhancing the mass-transport flux that influences the intrinsic catalytic property. Shinagawa et al. conducted a detailed investigation on the electrolyte engineering that shows a clear boundary on the reactant selectivity towards H 2 O/OH -reaction due to diffusion limitation of OH -and its contribution towards the mass transport of the buffered species in mild pH conditions [89] . Tavakkoli and coworkers measured the OER polarization curve of γ -Fe 2 O 3 /CNTs in 1 M and 0.1 M NaOH and reported the potential required to obtain a current density of 10 mAcm -2 to be 1.57 V and 1.61 V respectively [90] .</p>
        <p>Based on the previous analysis, the outstanding performance of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT towards overall water splitting can be attributed to the following factors. Based on the aforementioned results, Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT displays enhanced catalytic performance towards the overall water splitting reaction with a long term stability, endowing it as a promising future electrocatalyst for practical application. To our knowledge, the catalytic performance of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT is comparable and even superior to the state-of-the-art non-precious transition metal electrocatalyst (as compared in Table S2).</p>
        <p>In this work, we have reported a comprehensive study on the fabrication of Co 9 S 8 nanowire on MWCNTs (Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT) that can be used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and HER and finally as an overall water electrolyzer. We followed simple, scalable and economical pyrolysis method in presence of melamine and Co-salt for the preparation of Co/CNT and adding sulfur source in the mixture resulted in Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT. The higher surface area and hierarchical porosity of Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT (78.23 m 2 g -1 ) provides abundant active sites and facilitates mass transfer of reactants and products. The doped heteroatoms on graphene network, specifically Graphitic N, Pyridinic N and thioamide S atoms along with Co 9 S 8 metallic nanowire provide abundant active sites for overall water electrolysis. Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT serves both, as anode and cathode of two-cell water electrolyzer requiring a cell voltage of only 1.5 V to achieve a current density 10 mAcm -2 , showed excellent durability in prolonged 22 h water electrolysis in alkaline medium. Owing to the readily scalable synthesis technique, unique electronic and structural properties, superior electrocatalytic performance with excellent stability; Co/Co 9 S 8 /CNT promises to be a highly desirable electrocatalyst for both anode and cathode for overall water splitting in basic medium.</p>
