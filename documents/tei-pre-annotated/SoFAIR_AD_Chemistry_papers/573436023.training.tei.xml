        <p>Excitation of photoactive electron donoracceptor (EDA) complexes is an effective way to generate radicals. Applications in a catalytic regime typically use catalytic donors. Herein, we report that readily available electron-poor tetrachlorophthalimides can act as effective organocatalytic acceptors to trigger the formation of EDA complexes with a variety of radical precursors not amenable to previous catalytic methods. Excitation with visible light generates carbon radicals under mild conditions. The versatility of this EDA complex catalytic platform allowed us to develop mechanistically distinct radical reactions, including in combination with a cobalt-based catalytic system. Quantum yield measurements established that a closed catalytic cycle is operational, which hints at the ability of tetrachlorophthalimides to readily turn over and govern each catalytic cycle.Excitation of photoactive electron donoracceptor (EDA) complexes is an effective way to generate radicals.

        <p>Visible-light excitation of electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complexes 1 is a useful way to generate radicals under mild conditions. This strategy is attracting growing interest 2 because of the ease of operation and the possibility of activating colorless substances using light, without exogenous photoredox catalysts. Initial applications focused on the coupling of two stoichiometric donor and acceptor substrates. 3 Recently, researchers, 4 including us, 5 succeeded in implementing the EDA complex photochemistry within a catalytic regime, thus expanding the strategy's efficiency. These protocols relied on electron-rich catalysts to trigger EDA complex formation upon aggregation with electronpoor substrates adorned with a suitable redox auxiliary (RA in Figure 1a). A photoinduced single-electron transfer (SET) then generated radicals that could engage in a variety of bond-forming processes.Visible-light excitation of electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complexes 1 is a useful way to generate radicals under mild conditions.

        <p>We recently wondered about the feasibility of developing a complementary approach for EDA complex catalysis. Specifically, we thought that the use of catalytic acceptors could allow for the activation of electron-rich substrates not amenable to previous catalytic protocols (Figure 1b). The crucial step requires the effective turnover of the catalyst via SET oxidation of the catalyst radical anion, arising from the photoactivity of the progenitor EDA complex. A few recent reports used electron-poor catalysts to elicit EDA complex activation, 6 but these catalysts only proved useful to activate specific radical precursors and were therefore limited to selected transformations. Herein, we report a general and modular class of electron-acceptor organocatalysts that, although they cannot absorb visible light themselves, can readily form photoactive EDA complexes with a variety of electron-rich radical precursors. Specifically, we used readily available tetrachlorophthalimide-based catalysts to generate carbon radicals under blue light excitation and to develop mechanistically distinct reactions, including in combination with a metal-based catalytic system. We started our exploration by using cyclopentyl-1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP 1a, Figure 2a) as the radical precursor because of its established ability to participate in EDA complex formation acting as a donor. 7 Initial experiments were conducted with vinylsulfone 2a at 40 °C in dimethylformamide (DMF) using a blue LED emitting at 456 nm. The choice of suitable acceptor catalysts was informed by the tendency of phthalides and tetrachlorophthalides to serve as suitable electron-poor redox auxiliaries for stoichiometric EDA complex formation. 8 We surmised that these electron-poor fragments, when embedded within the cata-lyst structure, could ensure i) effective EDA complex formation, upon ground-state aggregation with electron-rich substrates; and ii) effective turnover, upon SET oxidation of the ensuing radical anion of type I (see mechanistic insight in Figure 1b). We first tested the catalytic activity of phthalimide A (20 mol%), which failed to provide the target Giese addition product 3a (entry 1, Figure 2b). In contrast, tetrachlorophthalimides B and C, which were prepared in a single step from commercial reagents, acted as effective EDA acceptor catalysts, affording 3a in high yield (entries 2 and 3, respectively). These different catalytic performances can be rationalized by considering the higher electron-acceptor ability of catalysts B and C, as inferred by their redox properties. Cyclic voltammetry studies, detailed in Figure 2c and Section D3 of the Supporting Information (SI), showed a well-shaped reversible behavior for B and C. This hints at a certain kinetic stability of the corresponding radical anion of type I, which can be crucial for catalyst turnover. We then evaluated the ability of our EDA acceptor catalysts to activate electron-rich radical precursors bearing other redox auxiliary groups than DHP. We found that silicate 1b 9 and trifluoroborate salt 1c 10 could also be activated to form a cyclopentyl radical. Catalyst C performed better than B in activating 1b and 1c, leading to the Giese product 3a in good yield (entries 5 and 7, respectively). These results highlight how the modular nature of the acceptor catalysts can be leveraged to optimize the activation of electronically different radical precursors.We recently wondered about the feasibility of developing a complementary approach for EDA complex catalysis.

        <p>Investigations were performed to gain mechanistic insights. The formation of an EDA aggregation in the ground state was confirmed through UV/Vis spectroscopic analysis (Figure 2d). After mixing catalyst B with 1a, the solution developed a pale-yellow colour, while its absorption spectrum showed a bathochromic displacement in the visible region. The same behaviour was observed when mixing catalyst C and silicate 1b and trifluoroborate salt 1c (detail in Figures S9 and S10 in SI). In contrast, no EDA complex formation was observed when mixing substrates 1a-c and 2a (see Section D2 in SI for details). We considered also the possibility that other photochemical pathways were operational in the generation of radicals, e.g. the direct excitation of catalysts B and C followed by SET activation of the substrates or the excitation of DHP 1a. We therefore conducted the model reaction using substrates 1a, 1b, and 1c under illumination by green light (λmax = 520 nm), a wavelength which cannot be absorbed by either the catalysts or the substrates (Figure 2d). All of these experiments led to the formation of product 3a, albeit with moderate yields (entries 8-10). Collectively, these results are congruent with the EDA complex excitation being responsible of radical generation. Further control experiments established that light and the tetrachlorophthalide-based catalysts were essential for reactivity (entries 11 and 12, respectively).Investigations were performed to gain mechanistic insights.

        <p>We then evaluated the scope of the Giese addition protocol using different radical precursors and electron-poor olefins (Figure 3a). In contrast to other methods, 11 there is no need for stoichiometric amounts of additional reagents (e.g., bases, reductants, hydrogen-atom donors) or for photoredox catalysts. The tetrachlorophthalimide-based catalyst B was used for the EDA complex activation of DHP radical precursors, while the mesitylene catalyst C proved more effective for alkylsilicates and organotrifluoroborates. Primary (product 3b), secondary (3a and 3c), tertiary (3d), and α-heteroatom (3e and 3f) radicals were generated efficiently and trapped with vinyl sulfone 2a in moderate to good yields. Other olefins could be used to intercept the photogenerated radicals, including dimethyl fumarate (products 3g and 3h), acrylonitrile (3i), cyclopentenone (3j), and dibenzoylethylene (3k and 3l). The use of bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethene 2b as the radical trap led to an addition-elimination sequence affording the vinylation products 4a and 4b in good yields (Figure 3b). A list of unsuccessful and moderately reactive substrates is reported in Figure S6 of the SI. The process could be readily performed on a synthetically significant scale (5 mmol). For example, the reaction of tert-butyl trifluoroborate and 2a offered product 3d in 52% yield (0.59 g).We then evaluated the scope of the Giese addition protocol using different radical precursors and electron-poor olefins (Figure 3a).

        <p>Mechanistically, we propose that the Giese reaction proceeds via a redox-neutral catalytic cycle (Figure 3c). Excitation of the EDA complex formed between the acceptor catalyst B or C and the electron-rich substrate 1 would generate the alkyl radical II along with the catalyst radical anion I (path detailed in Figure 1b). Interception of II by the electron-poor olefin 2 would lead to the reactive electrophilic radical III. SET reduction of III by the catalyst radical anion I would then afford product 3 while closing the catalytic cycle. The last SET event, which is crucial for catalyst turnover, is thermodynamically feasible on the basis of the redox properties of the radical anion I (E red = -0.84 for catalyst B) and radical III (e.g. E red = -0.54 vs SCE for the radical generated upon radical trap from fumarate). 12 To corroborate this mechanistic proposal, we measured the quantum yield (Φ) of the reaction of 1a and 2a catalyzed by B, which was as low as 0.04 (λ = 460 nm, using potassium ferrioxalate as the actinometer, see Section D.4 in SI). This result indicates that a radical-chain process is unlikely, confirming the ability of the EDA catalytic donor to turn over and repeatedly trigger radical formation. One of our goals was to identify a general acceptor catalyst suitable for the design of mechanistically distinct radical processes. Specifically, we sought to integrate our EDA complex catalytic platform with a cobalt-based catalytic process. The literature contains a few reports on the use of EDA complexes to generate radicals and feed a metalbased catalytic cycle. 13 However, to the best of our knowledge, the synergy of EDA catalysis and metal catalysis has not been realized. This idea was successfully implemented by combining the action of the EDA acceptor cat-alyst C and cobaloxime 7 14 to perform the Heck-type coupling of radical precursors 1 with styrene derivatives 5 (Figure 4a). 15 Figure 4.

        <p>The generality of this dual catalytic protocol, which afforded products 6, was first investigated with respect to the styrene component. Electron-poor (products 6b-g) and electron-rich (adducts 6h and 6i) styrenes bearing ortho-, meta-, or para-substituents on the aryl ring all reacted smoothly to provide the corresponding disubstituted al-kene products in moderate to good yields. Vinyl heteroarenes, bearing a pyridine (6j) or a thiophene (6k) scaffold, were competent substrates. While a large variety of DHP radical precursors were amenable to this Heck-type process, alkyl silicates could also be used. Primary (6l and 6m), secondary (6n-q), and tertiary (6r) carbon-centered radicals were effectively generated and coupled with vinyl-pyridine or styrene. A carbamoyl radical could also be used effectively (product 6s). We also demonstrated that this method is suitable for the direct functionalization of biorelevant compounds, since we installed the fenofibrate (6t), indomethacin (6u), pregnenolone (6v), pseudouridine (6w), and efavirenz (6x) scaffold within the Heck-type products.The generality of this dual catalytic protocol, which afforded products 6, was first investigated with respect to the styrene component.

        <p>The proposed mechanism is depicted in Figure 4b. The photoactivity of the catalytic EDA complex, formed by association of the acceptor catalyst C with the electron-rich radical precursor 1, would lead to the alkyl radical II and the catalyst radical anion I. Subsequent addition of II to styrene would furnish a stable benzylic radical intermediate IV. At this juncture, the EDA catalytic cycle would intersect the cobaloxime cycle: the catalyst radical anion I would undergo SET oxidation from the Co(III) catalyst 7 (E red [Co III /Co II ] = -0.67 V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in MeCN) 16 to afford the Co(II) species V while turning over the EDA acceptor catalyst. The cobaltbased catalytic cycle would continue with the Co(II) intermediate V intercepting the benzylic radical IV to form the Co(III) intermediate VI, which is known to undergo facile β-hydride eliminations. 17 This step would deliver the alkene product 6 and the Co(III)-H intermediate VII, which, upon reaction with either protic sources (e.g. protonated pyridine arising from DHPs) or another molecule of VII, would release H2 16 and regenerate the Co(III) catalyst 7. The quantum yield of the Heck-type reaction leading to product 6a was as low as 0.01 (λ = 460 nm, details in SI), which is congruent with the proposed dual catalytic cycle.The proposed mechanism is depicted in Figure 4b.

        <p>In summary, we found that tetrachlorophthalimidebased catalysts can act as effective and general acceptors for EDA complex activation. These organocatalysts can activate a variety of radical precursors bearing different redox auxiliaries, including DHPs, silicates, and trifluoroborates, which could not be activated by previous EDA catalytic protocols. Excitation with visible light granted access to alkyl radicals under mild conditions. Importantly, this EDA complex catalytic platform proved flexible enough to promote mechanistically different radical processes, including the first combination with a metal-based catalytic cycle.In summary, we found that tetrachlorophthalimidebased catalysts can act as effective and general acceptors for EDA complex activation.
