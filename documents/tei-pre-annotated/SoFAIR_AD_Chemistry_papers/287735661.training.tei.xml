        <p>Polypyridyl transition metal systems have been transformative for the field of photoredox catalysis with ruthenium and iridium catalysts representing particularly versatile scaffolds (Scheme 1). [1][2][3][4] The wide range of properties due to the tunability of their ligands make them exceptionally valuable catalysts for photochemical transformations. With the development of fully organic alternatives, the area opened up towards potentially sustainable processes. [5][6][7] Among them, acridinium salts pioneered by Fukuzumi 8,9 are known to have remarkable photophysical properties, complementary to those of polypyridyl transition metal structures. Their high reduction potential in the excited state (often E 1/2 [P*/P À ] 4 2 V vs. SCE) and their robustness, pH independence, and high solubility in a variety of solvents, render them valuable photocatalysts for a wide range of preparative transformations.Polypyridyl transition metal systems have been transformative for the field of photoredox catalysis with ruthenium and iridium catalysts representing particularly versatile scaffolds (Scheme 1).

        <p>A one step synthesis featuring a triarylamine precursor in a Friedel-Crafts reaction with a benzoyl chloride derivative delivered the desired acridinium salt 6 with a tetrasubstituted core in good yields (71-81%, Scheme 3). The construction of other acridinium salts with a disubstituted core proved to be more challenging, requiring several steps including an addition of a Grignard reagent to an acridone. For a modular synthesis of acridinium salts (7, X = N) and other heterocyclic analogues such as xanthylium dyes (7, X = O), we thus investigated the use of 1,5-bifunctional organometallic reagents that allow the direct conversion of a broad range of carboxylic acid esters. 16 Recently, Nicewicz and co-workers designed an efficient synthesis of acridinium photocatalysts starting from xanthylium salts. 17 The rapid assembly of a xanthylium dye was thereby combined with a condensation reaction with an aniline to give the corresponding acridinium salt 1.A one step synthesis featuring a triarylamine precursor in a Friedel-Crafts reaction with a benzoyl chloride derivative delivered the desired acridinium salt 6 with a tetrasubstituted core in good yields (71-81%, Scheme 3).

        <p>Furthermore, an elegant strategy consisting of an oxidative Ugi-type reaction for the synthesis of a novel class of imideacridinium salts has been developed by Manchen ˜o and Alema ´n (Scheme 4). 18 Starting from N-substituted acridanes, a coppercatalysed oxidation takes place at the C9 position to give a cationic intermediate that reacts with the isocyanide. After addition of the in situ formed benzoate, the intermediate is concomitantly rearranged in an Ugi-type fashion to produce the C9-substituted imide-acridanes 10. A subsequent aromatization by hydride abstraction carried out by tritylperchlorate delivered the desired acridinium salt 11. Photophysical and photoredox studies of these catalysts have been conducted. 19 Direct applications in photoredox catalysis were subsequently demonstrated with a suitable activity in several benchmarking transformation including anti-Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of alkenes and a dehydrogenative lactonization.Furthermore, an elegant strategy consisting of an oxidative Ugi-type reaction for the synthesis of a novel class of imideacridinium salts has been developed by Manchen ˜o and Alema ´n (Scheme 4). 18 Starting from N-substituted acridanes, a coppercatalysed oxidation takes place at the C9 position to give a cationic intermediate that reacts with the isocyanide.

        <p>A rapidly growing number of chemical transformations employs acridinium salts as catalysts. [20][21][22][23] Photooxidations, polar radical crossover cycloaddition reactions, C-H functionalization, crosscoupling and cross-dehydrogenative reactions, are merely selected recent examples of the use of acridinium salts in photoredox catalysis. [24][25][26][27][28][29][30] A recent example from the Nicewicz group emphasises their unique features by the radical conjugate addition of N-carbamate-protected secondary amines (Scheme 5). 22 Notably, the reduction potential required for the formation of the a-radical is too high for common Ru-or Ir-based photocatalysts (N-Boc-piperidine, E ox = 1.96 V vs. SCE). The application of strong excited-state oxidants such as the 9-mesityl-3,6-di-t-butyl-10-phenylacridinium salt or the Fukuzumi catalyst is hence required. This afforded the a-aminoalkylation of various carbamate protected secondary amines, including the substrate-controlled stereoselective synthesis of the natural product (+)-monomorine 15.A rapidly growing number of chemical transformations employs acridinium salts as catalysts.

        <p>Using a cascade of C-H and C-C bond cleavage steps, the group of Leonori achieved an intriguing remote functionalization of nitriles and ketones induced by the photoexcited Mes-Acr-Me + catalyst (Scheme 8). 33 The key step of this transformation lies in the formation of an iminyl radical arising from the SET oxidation and deprotonation of a carboxylic acid containing cyclic oxime 22. For instance, a stepwise sequence of an abnormal Beckmann fragmentation and a fluorination gives access to a broad range of distal fluorinated nitriles. This strategy could also be applied to the synthesis of g-fluorinated and chlorinated ketones. After SET oxidation of a linear oxime 24, a 1,5-hydrogen abstraction provides a nucleophilic g-radical that reacts with N-chlorosuccinimide or selectfluor to deliver the targeted compounds.Using a cascade of C-H and C-C bond cleavage steps, the group of Leonori achieved an intriguing remote functionalization of nitriles and ketones induced by the photoexcited Mes-Acr-Me + catalyst (Scheme 8). 33 The key step of this transformation lies in the formation of an iminyl radical arising from the SET oxidation and deprotonation of a carboxylic acid containing cyclic oxime 22.

Cleavage of the halogen-metal-bond then generates the radical bromide, which abstracts a hydrogen from the alkene to form an allylic radical compound. The reaction with the Ni intermediate then undergoes a reductive elimination to release the allylarene 39 or corresponding 1,4-dienes.Exploiting the properties of the Mes-Acr-Me + , Rueping and co-workers reported a cross-coupling of allylic C(sp 3 )-H bonds with aryl-and vinylbromides, using a combination of nickel and an acridinium photocatalyst (Scheme 14). 16,42 After the oxidative addition of aryl-or vinylbromide to the nickel, a triplet-triplet energy transfer was proposed to take place between the excited acridinium salt and the nickel species.

        <p>The performances of these photocatalysts was verified in several benchmarking reactions. A photoredox/nickel dual catalytic decarboxylative cross coupling of Boc-L-proline (75) with methyl 4-iodobenzoate (76), originally reported by Doyle and MacMillan with an iridium photocatalyst, was the starting point of our inquiry. 47 The C-C coupling product 77 was obtained in very good yield (86%) using the mesityl-substituted diaminoacridinium catalyst 47 (Scheme 20).

This property is likely required to design photocatalytic procedures while in other cases, tracing the fate of the photocatalyst during catalysis is expected to reveal interesting activation paths of utilized catalysts before a closed, productive cycle is entered. Besides the redox properties and stabilities, the kinetics, life time and energy of the excited states are other key parameters essential to refine photocatalytic reactions.The range of redox properties obtained by modulating the structure of aminoacridinium catalysts hence allows to employ a common structural motif for a great variety of visible-light photoredox catalysed processes.

        <p>In recent years, a growing library of acridinium catalysts has been developed and utilized for various visible-light photocatalytic processes. This allowed tuning of the redox properties to a most suitable range for preparative photosynthetic applications. Similar to the polypyridyl transition-metal catalysts, amino substituents tend to lower the E 1/2 (P*/P À ) by approximately 0.3-0.4 V while OMe groups typically allow fine tuning of the properties by 0.1-0.2 V. Moreover, alteration of substitution patterns also strongly influences the redox behaviour and thus allows further modification. Considering the numerous parameters contributing to the efficiency of the photocatalytic processes and their simultaneous variation during optimisation, it appears beneficial to employ catalysts of a common structural class to more rationally develop and improve the catalytic performance.In recent years, a growing library of acridinium catalysts has been developed and utilized for various visible-light photocatalytic processes.
