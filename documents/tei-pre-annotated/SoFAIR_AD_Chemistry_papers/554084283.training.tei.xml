        <p>Glycans are involved in various life processes and represent critical targets of biomedical developments. Nevertheless, the accessibility to long glycans with precise structures remains challenging. Here we report on the synthesis of glycans consisting of [→4)-α-Rha-(1 → 3)-β-Man-(1 → ] repeating unit, which are relevant to the O-antigen of Bacteroides vulgatus, a common component of gut microbiota. The optimal combination of assembly strategy, protecting group arrangement, and glycosylation reaction has enabled us to synthesize up to a 128-mer glycan. The synthetic glycans are accurately characterized by advanced NMR and MS approaches, the 3D structures are defined, and their potent binding activity with human DC-SIGN, a receptor associated with the gut lymphoid tissue, is disclosed.Glycans are involved in various life processes and represent critical targets of biomedical developments.

        <p>lycans represent the most abundant biopolymers in nature, which constitute prominent parts of all living organisms and mediate fundamental biological processes. Short glycans (oligosaccharides) with less than 20 monosaccharide units, such as those being conjugated with lipids and proteins on the cell surfaces, are usually sufficient to fulfill various biological functions, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration 1 . Longer glycans, such as glycosaminoglycans, display both structural properties and various physiological and pathological functions 2 . Polysaccharides, such as cellulose and starch/ glycogen, serve for structural requirements or energy storage. The microbial glycans are structurally and functionally extremely diverse. For example, those on the microbe cell envelope mediate host-microbial cross-talk and play a critical role in the activation of the immune system. The development of robust strategies for the synthesis of well-defined carbohydrate structures is nowadays a top priority and has an enormous impact in various biomedical sectors; in this context, synthetic carbohydrate-vaccines, as well as glycoconjugates-based adjuvants, have been produced 3 . Paradoxically, functional studies on long glycans with precise structures have been rarely performed 4 , due to the extremely difficult acquisition of pure long glycans via either isolation from natural sources or via chemical synthesis from mono-and oligosaccharide units. Indeed, natural glycans occur as heterogeneous mixtures, or despite showing homogeneous repeating units exhibit a range of size distributions. The chemical synthesis of long glycans has been limited by the notorious low efficiency of the glycosidic coupling and protecting group manipulations. Consequently, glycans containing over 20 monosaccharide units have been synthesized only occasionally [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] , contributing to the general idea that chemical synthesis of long glycans are not yet of practical usefulness 19 . In this regard, a paradigm shift in the functional studies of long glycans with precise structures requires the advancement of feasible approaches to their preparation, bringing innovation to the conventional synthetic carbohydrate chemistry 20,21 .lycans represent the most abundant biopolymers in nature, which constitute prominent parts of all living organisms and mediate fundamental biological processes.

        <p>Bacteroides vulgatus mpk is a commensal strain occurring commonly in the gastrointestinal tract of American and Western European population 22,23 . Recent studies demonstrated that this bacterium exerted strong immune-modulating properties leading to the prevention of colitis-induction in mouse models, and the Bacteroides lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced hyporesponsiveness towards subsequent LPS-stimuli. Also, the administration of Bacteroides LPS re-established intestinal immune homeostasis in a mouse model for experimental colitis, thus correlating the health-promoting effects to the weak agoniztic properties of this LPS 24,25 . Further, in the human innate immune system, we demonstrated a relevant capability of the LPS to induce antiinflammatory cytokines 26 27 (Fig. 1). The uniqueness of this structure and the relevance of glycan motifs in modulating the immune functions prompted us to synthesize homogeneous glycoforms containing Bacteroides O-antigen repeating units for structural and functional studies.Bacteroides vulgatus mpk is a commensal strain occurring commonly in the gastrointestinal tract of American and Western European population 22,23 .

        <p>Syntheses of the glycans. The target glycans consist of two types of glycosidic linkages, i.e., Rha-(1α→3)-Man and Man-(1β→4)-Rha. The β-mannopyranoside linkages are known to be difficult to construct in a highly stereoselective manner, while the αrhamnopyranoside linkages are among the easiest to synthesize 28 . This knowledge forced us to fix the requisite β-mannopyranoside linkage at a disaccharide level and to extend the glycan resorting to α-rhamnopyranosylation. Such a disaccharide building block required orthogonal protection at the Rha 1-OH and Man 3-OH, which could be transformed into the corresponding donor and acceptor for a convergent glycan elongation. Disaccharide 8, bearing MP (p-methoxyphenyl) and TBS (tert-butyldimethylsilyl) group at the reducing and non-reducing end, respectively, was found to be effective in the present work, in which the 4′,6′-Obenzylidene and 2′-O-benzyl group were used to facilitate the construction of the β-mannopyranoside linkage and the 2-Obenzoyl group to secure the α-rhamnopyranosylation in the subsequent glycan assembly (Fig. 2).Syntheses of the glycans.

        <p>Although the bulky 3′-O-TBS group installed at the mannopyranoside donors was known to be detrimental to the βselectivity in mannosylation 28,29 , we managed to prepare the desired disaccharide building block 8 in decagram scales with a convenient and inexpensive procedure (Supplementary Fig. 1 &amp; Supplementary Table 1). Removal of the TBS group with TBAF (THF, rt) led to disaccharide acceptor 8 A smoothly; at this stage, the β/α isomers resulted from the mannosylation step could be easily separated. The desired o-hexynylbenzoate donor 8 D was prepared from 8 via two steps, i.e., oxidative removal of the anomeric MP group with CAN (CH 2 Cl 2 , MeCN, H 2 O, 0 °C) and condensation with o-hexynylbenzoic acid (EDCI, DMAP, CH 2 Cl 2 , rt). As expected, the glycosidic coupling between disaccharide donor 8 D and acceptor 8 A proceeded smoothly under the standard gold(I)-catalyzed conditions (0.1 equiv. Ph 3 PAuNTf 2 , 5 Å MS, CH 2 Cl 2 , 0 °C) 30 , leading to tetrasaccharide 9 in 92% yield at a decagram scale, with the α-rhamnopyranoside linkage being exclusively formed.Although the bulky 3′-O-TBS group installed at the mannopyranoside donors was known to be detrimental to the βselectivity in mannosylation 28,29 , we managed to prepare the desired disaccharide building block 8 in decagram scales with a convenient and inexpensive procedure (Supplementary Fig. 1 &amp; Supplementary Table 1).

        <p>The convenient synthesis of 4-mer 9 from 2-mer 8 established an effective approach toward assembly of the 2 n+1 -mer glycans via repetition of a cycle of three transformations (Fig. 2), including (1) selective cleavage of the anomeric MP group (with CAN) and condensation of the resulting hemiacetal with ohexynylbenzoic acid to provide the donor (steps a and b); (2) selective removal of the non-reducing end TBS ether (with TBAF) to provide the acceptor (step c); and (3) coupling of the donor and acceptor (under the catalysis of Ph 3 PAuNTf 2 ) to furnish the 2 n+1 -mer glycan (step d). These transformations were found robust, so that the syntheses of 8-mer 10, 16-mer 11, and 32-mer 12 met with no incident in gram-scales.The convenient synthesis of 4-mer 9 from 2-mer 8 established an effective approach toward assembly of the 2 n+1 -mer glycans via repetition of a cycle of three transformations (Fig. 2), including (1) selective cleavage of the anomeric MP group (with CAN) and condensation of the resulting hemiacetal with ohexynylbenzoic acid to provide the donor (steps a and b); (2) selective removal of the non-reducing end TBS ether (with TBAF) to provide the acceptor (step c); and (3) coupling of the donor and acceptor (under the catalysis of Ph 3 PAuNTf 2 ) to furnish the 2 n+1 -mer glycan (step d).

        <p>Further transformations starting from 32-mer 12 (molecular weight (Mw) = 11,354) were challenged by the decreased solubility of the macromolecular substrates. Thus, removal of the TBS ether on 12 was carried out at a low concentration of 14.0 mM in THF; hydrolysis of the anomeric MP group at 2.2 mM in CH 2 Cl 2 /MeCN/H 2 O and condensation with o-hexynylbenzoic acid at 2.1 mM in CH 2 Cl 2 . These transformations were clean so that the desired 32-mer acceptor 12 A (88%) and donor 12 D (75%) were obtained with high purity after flash column chromatography on silica gel. The coupling of 12 A and 12 D was carried out at 7.4 mM in CH 2 Cl 2 (0.2 equiv.

        <p>The ready availability of 64-mer 13 (at a hundred mg scale) encouraged us to carry on the next synthetic cycle to prepare 128mer 14. The removal of the TBS group on 13 could only be carried out at a concentration of 1.7 mM in THF (10 equiv. TBAF, 4 equiv. HOAc, rt); hydrolysis of the anomeric MP group at 0.9 mM in CH 2 Cl 2 /MeCN/H 2 O (36 equiv.

Upon flash chromatography on short silica gel columns to remove the excess reagents, 64-mer acceptor 13 A and donor 13 D were obtained with satisfactory purity (~88% yields), as indicated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The coupling of 64mers 13 A (80 mg, 1 equiv.) and 13 D (1.4 equiv.) was then conducted at a concentration of 3.6 mM in CH 2 Cl 2 under otherwise similar conditions as used in the previous glycosylation reactions, and furnished 128-mer 14 is a decent 74% yield after GPC purification.The ready availability of 64-mer 13 (at a hundred mg scale) encouraged us to carry on the next synthetic cycle to prepare 128mer 14.

        <p>The remaining synthetic challenge was the global deprotection of the fully protected long glycans. For 128-mer 14, cleavage of 64 benzylidene, 64 benzyl, and 128 benzoyl groups, besides the terminal TBS and MP group, are required, involving scission of 322 C-O bonds. Fortunately, a procedure optimized on di-and tetrasaccharides 8 and 9 was successfully adapted to the deprotection of the longer congeners, that involved five sequential steps: (1) removal of the TBS ether with TBAF; (2) cleavage of the anomeric MP with CAN; (3) protection of the resulting hemiacetal with benzoyl group; (4) removal of the benzyl and benzylidene groups via hydrogenolysis; and (5) removal of the benzoyl groups with NaOCH 3 in MeOH. The seemingly redundant step (3) for capping the resultant hemiacetal was found crucial to the subsequent hydrogenolysis (especially for the long glycan substrates), since it enabled complete removal of the detrimental impurities from the proceeding steps and avoided degradation of the aldehyde. Nevertheless, hydrogenolysis of the longer glycans starting from 16-mer 11 was found difficult to complete, because the gradually releasing hydroxyl groups could cause an unwanted decrease of the solubility in the reaction solvents. Thus, repetitive hydrogenolysis was performed after the removal of the benzoates to cleave the remaining benzyl groups in a mixture solvent of MeOH/H 2 O/HOAc. Moreover, a combination of 10% Pd/C and 10% Pd(OH) 2 was used as the catalyst 31 . The complete and clean reactions enabled acquiring the free glycans with satisfactory purity via simple filtration through Sephadex G-25 (for 1-5) or LH-60 (for 6 and 7).The remaining synthetic challenge was the global deprotection of the fully protected long glycans.

        <p>Structural characterization. The fully protected and free glycans were well characterized by a combination of NMR and MS analyses. As for the free glycans 1-7, the 1 H-NMR spectra (Fig. 3a) showed a characteristic set of signals of the disaccharide repeating unit and were fully assigned (Supplementary Figs. 34567; Supplementary Table 6). The NMR resonances of the internal repeating units were coincident and clearly distinguishable from the terminal reducing and nonreducing units. The molecular size of the glycans was estimated by the integration of the 1 H-NMR signals (ratio of internal and terminal units) and by the retention time on GPC (Supplementary Fig. 2); as for the longer size 2345), and the hydrogenolysis (step f) was repeated a couple of times after step g until the benzyl groups were fully removed.

In particular, DOSY-NMR measurements, capable of determining the molecular self-diffusion coefficients 32,33 , were successfully applied to estimate the molecular weights of the longest glycans (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Fig. 13). In particular, DOSY-derived Mw for 64-mer 6 was well consistent with the theoretical value; the average molecular mass of 128-mer 7, complicated by its size and lability during ionization, was instead determined by MALDI-FT-ICR-MS (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 14) 34 .glycans, a combination of DOSY NMR and advanced MALDI-MS analyses was applied.

        <p>Conformation and immunological activities. Together with the complete NMR assignments (Supplementary Table 6; Supplementary Figs. 34567), molecular mechanics and dynamic simulation were carried out to assess the conformational behavior of the free glycans (Supplementary Figs. 89101112; Supplementary Table 7). The glycosidic linkages adopted Φ values in accordance with the exosyn anomeric conformation and were characterized by a certain degree of flexibility. The oligomers tend to form extended, flexible structures, as confirmed by the inter-residue NOE contacts, diagnostic of the absence of a compact disposition of the sugar backbone (Fig. 4a). On longer glycans (i.e., 64-and 128-mer), this may lead to a tendency to pack into supramolecular assemblies, this latter also accounting for the low solubility of the longer glycans and the low sensitivity of MALDI technique for the high Mw 128-mer.Conformation and immunological activities.

        <p>The synthetic approach allowed us to deploy a full set of pure synthetic different sized O-antigen fragments, which were tested for immunological activity. Given the presence of rhamnose and mannose in B. vulgatus O-antigen and considering the niche and the physiological roles of these commensal bacteria, we used three immune receptors of the gut-associated lymphoid tissues in the study. Thus, B. vulgatus LPS and their fragments were examined on a direct ELISA with three human C-type lectins (i.e., DC-SIGN, Langerin, and Dectin-1) 35,36 , showing a qualitative binding to DC-SIGN and Langerin (Supplementary Fig. 15a). Subsequently, the binding of B. vulgatus LPS to DC-SIGN and Langerin was tested in a quantitative ELISA competition experiment; a better binding to DC-SIGN was observed (Supplementary Fig. 15b). Following up, the synthetic glycans were tested on a competition ELISA experiment against DC-SIGN 37 . Expectedly, glycans 1-7 were shown to be able to inhibit the LPS binding to DC-SIGN in a typical dose-response curve (Fig. 4b). A better affinity for the longer glycans (6 and 7) was observed compared with the shorter ones. Hence, we additionally proved a selective binding of the synthetic O-antigens from B. vulgatus to DC-SIGN, adding unreported information that could explain the tolerogenic signaling induced by the commensal B. vulgatus in gut-associated lymphoid tissues.The synthetic approach allowed us to deploy a full set of pure synthetic different sized O-antigen fragments, which were tested for immunological activity.

        <p>The synthesis of glycans up to a 128-mer ( 7) consisting of disaccharide repeating unit of [→4)-α-Rha-(1 → 3)-β-Man-(1 → ] n have been achieved. The present success is attributable to the following aspects: (1) The strategic [2 n + 2 n ] glycosylation enables exponential growth of the glycan sizes 17 , leading to 128mer via only six repetitive cycles of transformations, and ready separation of the double-sized products from the remaining and decomposed substrates. The heroic syntheses of a linear 50-mer 13 and a 100-mer 18 via step-wide glycosylation demanded exhaustive reactions (glycosylation and capping on a solid support) at each step; while the synthesis of the 151-mer 18 and 92-mer 14 The gold(I)-catalyzed glycosylation reaction, involving α-rhamnopyranosylation, is both stereospecific (in the presence of a neighboring-participating benzoyl group) and high-yielding. The 64-mer donor (13 D ) represents the longest glycosyl donor that has ever been employed for successful glycosylation; this might be attributed to the merits of glycosyl ortho-alkynylbenzoates, including easy preparation, stability, and selective activation under mild conditions 30 .The synthesis of glycans up to a 128-mer ( 7) consisting of disaccharide repeating unit of [→4)-α-Rha-(1 → 3)-β-Man-(1 → ] n have been achieved. The present success is attributable to the following aspects: (1) The strategic [2 n + 2 n ] glycosylation enables exponential growth of the glycan sizes 17 , leading to 128mer via only six repetitive cycles of transformations, and ready separation of the double-sized products from the remaining and decomposed substrates.

        <p>Besides the synthetic achievement, the availability of pure homogeneous glycans has allowed us to test the limits of analytical tools for the characterization of polysaccharides. Thus, the accurate confirmation of the molecular size of 64-mer (6) represents one of the longest glycan determined so far by DOSY-NMR, and the average molecular mass of 128-mer (7) represents the highest mass of a synthetic linear polysaccharide being measured by MS. Moreover, the synthetic O-antigen showed a selective affinity with human lectin DC-SIGN and this might be relevant information for therapeutic use against different gutassociated inflammatory diseases. We expect that the present report can inspire researches on the syntheses and thus functional studies on pure and homogenous polysaccharides for different therapeutic uses.Besides the synthetic achievement, the availability of pure homogeneous glycans has allowed us to test the limits of analytical tools for the characterization of polysaccharides.
