        <p>Proteins receive very different levels of attention from scientists. The most popular protein in the human proteome is p53. On average, it is the subject of two publications per day 1 . At the same time, the biological function of thousands of human proteins remains unexplored [2][3][4][5] . Indeed, this bias in the functional characterisation of the human proteome is massive: 95% of all life science publications are about an elite group of 5,000 especially well-studied human proteins 6 . The sequencing of the human genome was expected to be a crucial step towards reducing this bias, by identifying all human genes and thus offering researchers opportunities to study previously unknown genes. However, in 2011, a decade after the publication of the genome sequence, 75% of publications still focused on genes that were already being studied before the genome was mapped 7 . Annotation inequality has increased since then, and has, in fact, almost doubled since the human genome sequence was released 2 .Proteins receive very different levels of attention from scientists.

        <p>Annotation inequality hinders biomedical progress, because mechanistic investigations of gene-disease associations typically focus on proteins that are already well-known (Figure 1), a phenomenon also known as the street-light effect 8 . Meanwhile, many uncharacterised proteins are not subjected to functional studies despite strong evidence from "omics" studies for their association with human disease 2 . For example, the function of many proteins involved in rare diseases (which are not rare collectively) are poorly understood 9 . Moreover, common diseases such as neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer are caused by collections of many rare genetic variants in different genes 10 . Remarkably, out of the 1,878 genes that are essential for proliferation in a human cell line, 330 (18%) remained uncharacterised, as of 2015 11 . This bias extends to the ~3,000 proteins currently expected to be druggable: only 5-10% of the potentially druggable proteins are currently targeted by FDA approved pharmaceuticals 5 .Annotation inequality hinders biomedical progress, because mechanistic investigations of gene-disease associations typically focus on proteins that are already well-known (Figure 1), a phenomenon also known as the street-light effect 8 .

        <p>The reasons for this protein annotation bias are manifold. Some are of a practical nature, reflecting how easily a protein can be studied with widely available methods. For example, the availability of experimental tools such as antibodies, plasmids or curated reference data is a strong incentive to work on well-studied proteins 2,7 . The number of publications about a protein is also related to basic biological and biochemical properties, such as protein size, abundance, hydrophobicity and the sensitivity of its gene towards mutations 4 . The dynamic range of our detection devices does not yet match that of proteins in a cell. In fact, to date, 1,899 (9.6%) of the 19,733 human protein-coding genes lack credible support from any proteomics technology, some of which may constitute genome annotation errors 12 .The reasons for this protein annotation bias are manifold.

        <p>In addition, very small size is a strikingly common feature of under-studied proteins: 40% of the least well-annotated proteins in SwissProt are smaller than 15 kDa 13 . This is despite the importance of microproteins, for example, as neuropeptides in brain development 14 . Moreover, what we currently consider to be the repertoire of understudied small proteins may just be the tip of an iceberg, as we are only beginning to uncover the array of "alternative proteins", which come from regions of the genome that were previously considered noncoding 15 .In addition, very small size is a strikingly common feature of under-studied proteins: 40% of the least well-annotated proteins in SwissProt are smaller than 15 kDa 13 .

        <p>Other reasons for protein annotation inequality may reflect conceptual biases in the research system rather than protein properties. For example, it is often assumed that proteins studied by many people are functionally more important 7 , although this is not supported by evidence such as genome-wide association studies or functional genomic screens 2,11,16,17 . In addition, scientists often prefer to explore a problem they already work on in more detail, in part because funding and peer-review systems are risk-averse 7 . Working in a large research field enhances the chances to be cited and consequently also increases the chances for high-impact journal publications required for academic success 18 . However, large fields also tend to favour existing paradigms over new ideas, thus slowing scientific progress overall 4,19,20 .Other reasons for protein annotation inequality may reflect conceptual biases in the research system rather than protein properties.

        <p>Equally important is the limited set of conditions studied in the laboratory, a situation that might, paradoxically, be a consequence of the desire to make research more reproducible through standardisation of the experimental conditions. For example, under standard laboratory growth conditions, the deletion of about 20% of S. cerevisiae genes causes a lethal phenotype 21 . However, when the condition space is expanded, 97% of the genes are essential for optimal growth under at least one condition 22 . Indeed, the choice of "standard" condition often reflects historical reasons, rather than the desire to capture the entirety of biological complexity. For instance, the most popular synthetic yeast medium in use today emerged from an early 1950's publication of the US Dept of Agriculture technical bulletin, which attempted to help farmers and biotechnologists to grow a wide variety of yeasts, for instance to start fermentation processes 23 . The problem is further compounded for multicellular organisms with specialized cell types; some tissues or cell types are much more studied than others.Equally important is the limited set of conditions studied in the laboratory, a situation that might, paradoxically, be a consequence of the desire to make research more reproducible through standardisation of the experimental conditions.

        <p>Finally, protein annotation bias could reflect the current focus on hypothesis-driven, rather than question-driven, research 24,25 . It is difficult to formulate hypotheses on the mechanistic molecular function of an uncharacterised protein. Intriguingly, the philosopher Francis Bacon, often credited as the father of the scientific method, argued in the early 1600s that experiments should not be driven by hypotheses, for fear of introducing bias in the observer and stifling innovation 24,26 . In line with this, it has been suggested that strictly data-driven approaches could help to reduce protein annotation inequality 2,27 .Finally, protein annotation bias could reflect the current focus on hypothesis-driven, rather than question-driven, research 24,25 .

        <p>From a standpoint of drug discovery, fundamental advances towards the characterisation of understudied proteins are being made by initiatives that improve our understanding of proteinsmall molecule interactions, such as the Structural Genomics Consortium 28 , the Enzyme Function Initiative 29 , the Illuminating the Druggable Genome program 5 and Open Targets 30 . In this context, "functional characterisation" is typically interpreted as revealing molecular properties of a protein that are particularly relevant for drug development, e.g. its structure, ligands, inhibition by chemical probes and association with disease. Particular emphasis is placed on pharmacologically tractable protein families, such as ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors and kinases 5,31,32 .From a standpoint of drug discovery, fundamental advances towards the characterisation of understudied proteins are being made by initiatives that improve our understanding of proteinsmall molecule interactions, such as the Structural Genomics Consortium 28 , the Enzyme Function Initiative 29 , the Illuminating the Druggable Genome program 5 and Open Targets 30 .

        <p>From a perspective of cell biology and basic research, it is equally important to study other levels of protein annotation, such as in which cellular processes, pathways and subcellular compartments a protein functions. In addition, many understudied proteins do not belong to a traditional druggable family, although the definition of a druggable protein is evolving over time as new approaches (such as PROTACs 33 ) are developed. One set of methods that is ideally suited to study this cell biological aspect of protein function, and to do so on a comprehensive, proteome-wide scale, is functional proteomics.From a perspective of cell biology and basic research, it is equally important to study other levels of protein annotation, such as in which cellular processes, pathways and subcellular compartments a protein functions.

        <p>Two different types of protein annotation efforts may be distinguished: original investigations and "guilt-by-association" approaches. The original investigation of a novel biological function is an essential but also a time-consuming and costly effort involving many detailed, mechanistic studies. For researchers to commit to such an effort, it is necessary for a protein to have a certain basal annotation level. Without this, hypotheses to probe a protein's function lack foundation. Here, annotation by "functional association" can provide the lacking foundations through knowledge transfer, whereby previously uncharacterised proteins are linked to well-studied factors and their biological functions [34][35][36][37][38] .Two different types of protein annotation efforts may be distinguished: original investigations and "guilt-by-association" approaches.

        <p>Proteomics approaches are particularly well suited for revealing functional associations at large scale. This includes techniques that identify protein-protein interactions, such as affinity-purification MS [39][40][41] , crosslinking MS 42 and co-fractionation MS 43 , approaches that identify which proteins are co-regulated [44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51] and methods that reveal which proteins share a subcellular space 52- 55 (Box 1). For example, the majority of centrosomal proteins were considered to have been identified 56 before antibody-based proteomics identified hundreds of additional centrosomal proteins 57 . Note that here we focus on mass spectrometry and antibody-based proteomics, but powerful alternative proteomics approaches exist that have been reviewed elsewhere 58,59 . There are also many functional genomics approaches that do not rely on measuring proteins for functional association, including gene expression profiling, whereby functionally related genes are linked on the basis of similar expression patterns 60 , metabolic profiling 61 and genetic interaction screening 62 . Rapid advances in genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening have accelerated the pace of functional annotation of proteins involved in susceptibility to therapeutic compounds, or those that become essential in a specific genetic context 63 .Proteomics approaches are particularly well suited for revealing functional associations at large scale.

        <p>While mass spectrometry-based proteomics does not yet reach the gene coverage of genomic approaches, observing proteins directly can be especially informative when studying the function of (protein-coding) genes. For example, protein co-expression captures functional relationships considerably better than mRNA co-expression 13,64 . Protein-based analyses also have the potential to distinguish between proteoforms, i.e. the individual molecular forms of expressed proteins 65 , which as a result of splicing and post-translational modifications dramatically increase the functional diversity of the proteome 65 . Proteoform characterisation may require the use of top-down 66,67 or middle-down 68 proteomics approaches. Proteomics is rapidly increasing in throughput, with methods emerging that allow for hundreds of proteomes to be recorded per day on a single mass spectrometer 69,70 . A new generation of functional proteomic studies will hence be able to generate a much more comprehensive spectrum of biological functionality.While mass spectrometry-based proteomics does not yet reach the gene coverage of genomic approaches, observing proteins directly can be especially informative when studying the function of (protein-coding) genes.

        <p>Nevertheless, protein annotation inequality is unlikely to be resolved exclusively by large scale approaches. The first step in a concerted effort to address protein annotation bias could be to systematically provide the necessary minimal data foundation required for individual researchers conducting targeted experiments. Ongoing examples for this include BioPlex 71 and hu.MAP 72 , which use mass spectrometry for the large-scale identification of protein-protein interactions and protein complexes, the Human Protein Atlas 73,74 , which uses antibodies to assign human proteins to different tissues and subcellular locations, and the neXt-CP50 project that aims to characterise 50 understudied proteins by proteomics 75 .Nevertheless, protein annotation inequality is unlikely to be resolved exclusively by large scale approaches.

        <p>How to increase the impact of functional proteomics on mechanistic research? Some highly promising proteins remain ignored despite being perfectly amenable for detailed functional investigation 4 . Making protein-protein associations more accessible and usable for mechanistic follow-up studies will therefore be an important step towards reducing annotation inequality. Biologists can inspect molecular networks through a variety of powerful and userfriendly resources 76 , including IntAct, BioGRID, NDEx and STRING. The fact that annotation bias is worsening 2 despite the wide availability of such resources could be the result of a number of factors. One may be a lack of awareness of such annotation portals among cell biologists. Others may be lack of trust, lack of annotations, and lack of integration of different annotation types.How to increase the impact of functional proteomics on mechanistic research?

        <p>Cell biologists may hesitate to rely on data from large-scale projects due to a perceived lack of accuracy, which could be improved by better communication. Indeed, the possibility of treating error in a statistical way is a particular strength of large-scale approaches. While error cannot be avoided, its size is a critical parameter to understand how reliable results are. One example of a functional proteomics technique where false discovery rate (FDR) calculation has been established is crosslinking mass spectrometry 77 . Similarly, FDR is routinely calculated for all mass spectrometry protein identifications 78,79 . In addition, in spatial proteomics, statistical frameworks are being developed to encapsulate confidence of assigning proteins to subcellular niches 80,81 .Cell biologists may hesitate to rely on data from large-scale projects due to a perceived lack of accuracy, which could be improved by better communication.

        <p>In addition to expanding the amount of available large-scale data, it will undoubtedly be necessary to develop new tools and techniques to provide additional, complementary links and fill systematic gaps left by current approaches. Examples of emerging functional proteomics technologies are crosslinking mass spectrometry 42 , coaggregation proteomics 82 and methods to study dynamic subcellular niches 52,55 . The large success by which protein structures can be predicted now 83 offers the exciting possibility to improve structure-based function prediction, especially when the predicted structures could be experimentally confirmed, e.g. by crosslinking mass spectrometry 84 . These and other in-cell techniques are particularly attractive as many proteins require assistance for folding or cofactors or post-translational modifications to function correctly and would therefore need to be studied in their native environment.

        <p>Finally, a key remaining challenge is the integration of different types of data across scales (time and space), which will maximise synergies between different types of omics data. An example for this is the integration of the Human Protein Atlas and BioPlex data, underpinning that the generation of a cellular hierarchy reveals many novel cellular systems not detectable with either dataset alone 86 . Such computational tools could also accelerate science through providing data-driven hypothesis generation, i.e. opportunities for researchers to connect their data to big proteomics data.Finally, a key remaining challenge is the integration of different types of data across scales (time and space), which will maximise synergies between different types of omics data.

        <p>Even where the function of a protein is well annotated, there is increasing evidence to suggest that a number of proteins have the capacity to carry out alternative unrelated functions, reported in the literature as 'moonlighting' 87 . Historically, as researchers have assumed 'oneprotein one-function', alternative functions have not been sought for most proteins. An additional benefit of the systems-wide interrogation of the functional proteome will be to provide alternative functional annotations even for well-studied proteins and a better understanding of the extent to which proteins are capable of 'moonlighting'.Even where the function of a protein is well annotated, there is increasing evidence to suggest that a number of proteins have the capacity to carry out alternative unrelated functions, reported in the literature as 'moonlighting' 87 .

        <p>To develop, optimise and evaluate strategies to tackle protein annotation inequality, one needs to be able to measure their impact in a robust and informative way. Measuring the degree of functional characterisation is far from trivial, not least because the term itself can have different meanings. "Protein function" may refer to the wider biological purpose of a protein, such as to which phenotype it associates, or to which metabolic pathway it belongs to. It could also refer to structural and mechanistic insights into how a protein fulfils these functions on a molecular level, e.g. the enzymatic mechanism.To develop, optimise and evaluate strategies to tackle protein annotation inequality, one needs to be able to measure their impact in a robust and informative way.

        <p>A number of approaches to determine protein annotation levels have been developed, including a literature score based on text mining 6 , the Uniprot annotation score 88 , an assessment of GO coverage 3 and a system to classify proteins based on their development as drug targets 5 . Each of these metrics captures or emphasises slightly different aspects of the available annotations. They do not distinguish between original characterisation and functional association. However, to systematically evaluate the performance of an annotation transfer system, it will be necessary to quantify it adequately. The McNamara fallacy 89 illustrates the danger of evaluating progress towards a complex goal on the basis of a single, easy-to-measure target variable, without taking into account broader and more difficult to measure aspects of the challenge (McNamara's over-reliance on a single quantitative metric -number of enemy combatants killed or wounded -has been linked to US American failure in the Vietnam War).A number of approaches to determine protein annotation levels have been developed, including a literature score based on text mining 6 , the Uniprot annotation score 88 , an assessment of GO coverage 3 and a system to classify proteins based on their development as drug targets 5 .

        <p>We have argued that the proteome is a powerful layer for annotating gene function, but proteomics approaches are also susceptible to biochemical bias, e.g. from protein abundance and solubility. Therefore, to achieve a systematic reduction in the genome-wide annotation bias, it may be necessary to optimise multiple individual functional proteomics methods and integrate their results in a concerted effort. One may also integrate proteomics data with data produced by other omic disciplines. Metabolomics, for instance, can capture a complementary functional spectrum 61,90 . Note that combining proteomics and genetics, functional genetics, or metabolomics, substantially improves the predictability of phenotypes 91,92 .We have argued that the proteome is a powerful layer for annotating gene function, but proteomics approaches are also susceptible to biochemical bias, e.g. from protein abundance and solubility.

        <p>Regardless of the approaches taken, however, the narrow window of standard laboratory conditions must probably be left behind. Recent multi-organism proteomics surveys 93,94 suggest that potentially many more proteins could be characterized by comparative proteomics, taking advantage of the broad evolutionary conservation of many proteins' functions and the differential accessibility of conserved proteins across organisms. The fact that many omic technologies can be directly applied to human cells, combined with the advent of genome editing, has raised concerns that funding for work on non-human organisms might be in decline 95,96 , although indepth statistics indicate that these concerns may be, at present, unfounded 97 . Studying a broad diversity of organisms has not only brought us Penicillin, GFP and CRISPR/Cas9, but may also help us to capture the functional spectrum of the human proteome.Regardless of the approaches taken, however, the narrow window of standard laboratory conditions must probably be left behind.

        <p>We envisage that the time is right for a coordinated effort to reduce annotation inequality across the human genome and proteome (Figure 2). Our "understudied proteins initiative" will include different data generation approaches, develop an integration framework and make the annotations available to researchers in an appropriate form. The project will aim to address not only the technical but also the biomedical reasons for missing gene functions, such as narrowly defined growth conditions, single time-point studies, and the focus on very few laboratory models with low genetic variability. This protein function moonshot may also stimulate methodological developments in functional proteomics and may extend to other species.We envisage that the time is right for a coordinated effort to reduce annotation inequality across the human genome and proteome (Figure 2).

        <p>As a first step, the goal must be defined clearly. If the contribution of functional proteomics is to stimulate mechanistic studies of under-characterized proteins then what is the minimum information that scientists require to start such work? This question can only be answered by those that illuminate the cellular function of individual proteins in molecular and mechanistic detail. Ultimately, it is the sum of their individual subjective decisions as laboratory scientists and reviewers that decide what proteins are being studied in detail. We recently launched a survey to capture their views (https://understudiedproteins.org/survey).As a first step, the goal must be defined clearly.

        <p>As a second step, a community of interested scientists must be built. This will be started at an upcoming meeting, supported by the Wellcome Trust, https://understudiedproteins.org/conference. The meeting will discuss the outcome of the survey, its implications for the goals of an understudied proteins initiative and how progress towards these goals could be monitored. This will set the frame for an open discussion on what technologies or developments may be able to systematically unlock the potential of currently uncharacterised proteins in biomedical research and therefore become part of a larger roadmap. A survey will help define the challenge and goals for the initiative. Then, a workshop will bring together experts from the large-scale data community to establish the initiative framework, covering six action areas to be discussed. Finally, a collaborative effort of many labs will experimentally tackle the problem of understudied proteins.As a second step, a community of interested scientists must be built.

        <p>Mass spectrometry (MS) and antibody-based approaches that enable annotation transfer by identifying protein-protein interactions (PPIs) differ in the nature of the links they provide, their scalability and their biases. Each approach has strengths and weaknesses. The following is a non-exhaustive list of key technologies applied in recent years:Mass spectrometry (MS) and antibody-based approaches that enable annotation transfer by identifying protein-protein interactions (PPIs) differ in the nature of the links they provide, their scalability and their biases.

        <p>Protein co-regulation: Protein abundance changes between different biological conditions, or in response to perturbations, are determined by MS and compared using correlation analysis or machine learning 13,[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51] . This improved on previous mRNA co-expression studies 13,64 . Unlike other methods listed here, protein co-regulation does not detect physical relationships but coordinated protein abundance changes, which are taken to reflect shared participation in a biological process.Protein co-regulation: Protein abundance changes between different biological conditions, or in response to perturbations, are determined by MS and compared using correlation analysis or machine learning 13,[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51] .
