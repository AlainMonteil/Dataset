        <p>Color additives are important for the food industry to improve sensory quality lost during food process and to expand the variety of products. In general, artificial colorants have lower cost and better stability than the natural ones. Nevertheless, studies have reported their association with some health disorders. Furthermore, consumers have given greater attention to food products with health beneficial effects, which has provided a new perspective for the use of natural colorants. In this context, fruits are an excellent alternative source of natural compounds, that allow the obtainment of a wide range of colorant molecules, such as anthocyanins, betalains, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. Furthermore, in addition to their coloring ability, they comprise different bioactive properties. However, the extraction and application of natural colorants from fruits is still a challenge, since these compounds show some stability problems, in addition to issues related to the sustainability of raw-materials providing. To overcome these limitations, several studies have reported optimized extraction and stabilization procedures. In this review, the major pigments found in fruits and their extraction and stabilization techniques for uses as food additives will be looked over.Color additives are important for the food industry to improve sensory quality lost during food process and to expand the variety of products.

        <p>The use of food additives is fundamental to guarantee food quality and safety, and the introduction of chemical substances into food has been reported since the antiquity. However, with technological advances and population growth, an increasing number of food additives is generally used to confer various benefits to food such as microbiological safety and providing greater shelf-life, besides enabling the expansion of a variety of products with different sensory properties, such as color, flavor, and aroma (Carocho et al. 2014;Martins et al. 2016).The use of food additives is fundamental to guarantee food quality and safety, and the introduction of chemical substances into food has been reported since the antiquity.

        <p>According to the Codex Alimentarius (WHO/FAO 2018), food additives are considered any substances that are not consumed as food and are not normally used as an ingredient in food, whether or not they contain nutritional value, whose addition is intentional in a food for technological purposes (including organoleptic) in the processing, packaging, storage and distribution of the product. About 230 food additives are often used by the food industry to confer technological, sensorial and/or preservation functionalities. These additives can be divided into 6 main groups: preservatives, nutritional additives, coloring agents, flavoring agents, texturizing agents, and miscellaneous agents (Carocho et al. 2014;Martins, Sentanin, and Souza 2019). The use of these compounds is controlled by regulations and legislations depending on the country in which the products are manufactured and/or marketed. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) is the international body responsible for evaluating the safety of food additives; however, some countries follow their own legislation determined by a competent agency. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the authority responsible for these legislation in the United States of America (USA), while in the European Union (EU), it is the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). It is up to these authorities to determine which additives are allowed, as well as their Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), which means the maximum amount of substance ingested per day by person, expressed by mg/kg body weight (bw)/day, throughout life that will not cause harm to the consumers health (Carocho et al. 2014).According to the Codex Alimentarius (WHO/FAO 2018), food additives are considered any substances that are not consumed as food and are not normally used as an ingredient in food, whether or not they contain nutritional value, whose addition is intentional in a food for technological purposes (including organoleptic) in the processing, packaging, storage and distribution of the product.

        <p>In Europa, all food additives receive a specific code starting with the letter E following by three or four numbers, designated as E number, which facilitates consumers understanding when reading the label of foodstuff from different European countries, for example color additives correspond to the code range from E100 to E199; preservatives from E200 to E299, antioxidants from E300 to E399, structural additives (thickeners, stabilizers and emulsifiers) from E400 to E499; pH regulators and anti-caking agents from E500 to 599; flavor enhancers from E600 to E640; and sweeteners from E900 to E999. This code system has also been used by Codex Alimentarius (Carocho et al. 2014).In Europa, all food additives receive a specific code starting with the letter E following by three or four numbers, designated as E number, which facilitates consumers understanding when reading the label of foodstuff from different European countries, for example color additives correspond to the code range from E100 to E199; preservatives from E200 to E299, antioxidants from E300 to E399, structural additives (thickeners, stabilizers and emulsifiers) from E400 to E499; pH regulators and anti-caking agents from E500 to 599; flavor enhancers from E600 to E640; and sweeteners from E900 to E999.

        <p>The use of food additives is common in several foods, from minimally processed to ultra-processed, but the relationship between the consumer and the use of food additives, particularly the artificial, is not so friendly (Carocho et al. 2014). Acceptability and the use of artificial additives have been declining in recent decades, and this has been associated with issues of food safety and consumer concerns with the adverse effects of some of these substances on their health. Some additives, namely preservatives and colorants, have been associated with some health disorders, such as allergies and hyperactivity (Kamal and Fawzia 2018;Leo et al. 2018). However, it is still necessary to establish a worldwide consensus on the legislation of food additives. Thus, some substances are allowed to be added in foods in the USA, and banned in the EU, as is the case of the antimicrobials sodium sorbate (E201) and calcium sorbate (E203) and the colorants FD&amp;C Green No. 3 (Fast Green (E143)) and citrus red No.2 (E121). On the other hand, the antimicrobial sodium methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (E219) and the colorants carmoisine (E122), amaranth (E123), and patent Blue (E131) are allowed in the EU and forbidden in the USA (Carocho et al. 2014;Martins, Sentanin, and Souza 2019). This shows a lack of harmony between legislations, which can become a barrier to international trade, in addition to making food safety uncertain to additives with contradictory evaluations.The use of food additives is common in several foods, from minimally processed to ultra-processed, but the relationship between the consumer and the use of food additives, particularly the artificial, is not so friendly (Carocho et al. 2014).

        <p>Visual aspect, including color of food, is one of the first sensory characteristics to be evaluated by consumers. Colorants are important for the industry as they act to compensate for coloration due to exposure to light, air, humidity, processing and storage conditions; correct color variations, improve sensory aspects, and enable food diversification (Martins et al. 2016;Martins, Sentanin, and Souza 2019).Visual aspect, including color of food, is one of the first sensory characteristics to be evaluated by consumers.

        <p>Differences in chemical structures, sources, and purpose of use, may make complex the classification of colorants. A simple way for their division could be based on their source, as natural and artificial. Natural colorants can be obtained from plant tissue (e.g. curcumin, carotenoids, anthocyanins, betalains, and chlorophylls), animal cell (e.g. carminic acid and kermesic acid), microorganism metabolism (e.g. carotenoids and chlorophylls), or mineral source (e.g. titanium dioxide and calcium carbonate). Artificial colorants are substances that are not found in nature and are obtained by chemical synthesis (Carocho et al. 2014). The use of artificial additives is preferred by industry, because they have a higher stability, attractive color, and lower costs (Martins et al. 2016). The artificial colorants used by the food industry are: (i) blue color: brilliant blue FCT (E133, ADI of 6 mg/kg bw/day), indigo carmine (E132, ADI of 5 mg/kg bw/day), and patent blue V (E131, ADI of 5 mg/kg bw/day); (ii) red-orange color: allura red AC (E129, ADI of 7 mg/kg bw/day), amaranth (E123, ADI of 0.15 mg/kg bw/day), carmoisine (E122, ADI of 4 mg/kg bw/day), erythrosine (E127, ADI of 0.1 mg/kg bw/day), litholrubine BK (E180, ADI of 1.5 mg/kg bw/day), and ponceau 4 R (E124); (iii) yellow color: quinoline yellow (E104, ADI of 0.5 mg/kg bw/day), sunset yellow (E110, ADI of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day), and tartrazine (E102, ADI of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day); and (iv) green color: fast green (E143, forbidden in the EU and allowed in the USA with ADI of 12.5 mg/kg bw/day) and green S (E142, 5 mg/kg bw/day) (Martins et al. 2016;Carocho et al. 2014). On the other hand, studies reported that the consumption of artificial colorants, especially nitrous derivatives, azo type (E102, E110, E122, E123, E124 and E129), can cause some health disorders. European Parliament in 2008 decreed that foods containing one or more of these color additives, should bear on their labels the name or E number information followed by the advertence: "may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children" (Carocho et al. 2014). Tartrazine, a lemon yellow, used in candy, ice-cream, cereals, soup, jam, cake, soft-drink, and other foodstuffs, is one of the most contradictory color additives in relation to its safety. The ingestion of this colorant has been associated to obsessive-compulsive disturbances and hyperactivity in children (Kamal and Fawzia 2018). Several studies have investigated the ability of tartrazine to interact with human serum proteins and cause damage on DNA (Leo et al. 2018;Abo-EL-Sooud et al. 2018). In recent studies, the administration of tartrazine with ADI levels in mice, showed an increase of lipid oxidation and alterations in biochemical markers in the brain tissue (Bhatt et al. 2018), haematotoxin, immunotoxin effects, renal disorder, and increase of DNA abnormalities (Abd-Elhakim et al. 2018;Abo-EL-Sooud et al. 2018). Sunset yellow, produced from aromatic compounds derived from petroleum, has also been associated with the increase of pro-inflammatory activity, as well as carmoisine, allura red, and ponceau 4 R, which are also reported to bind human and bovine serum albumin (Leo et al. 2018). Amaranth, a colorant that confers red color to food, such as in candy, ice-cream, and drinks, allowed in the EU, but banned in the USA due to carcinogenicity, has shown high genotoxic effect in cultured human lymphocytes (Carocho et al. 2014).Differences in chemical structures, sources, and purpose of use, may make complex the classification of colorants.

        <p>For these reasons and due to the changing lifestyle of consumers, natural colorants is a research area that is growing (Rodriguez-Amaya 2016). The interest in the use of natural colorants goes beyond their pigmentation capacity, since these compounds have bioactive properties that may be beneficial both for foodstuff preservation and for consumers heath, such as antidiabetic, anti-neuro-disorder, anticancer and anticardiovascular effects (Rodriguez-Amaya 2016).For these reasons and due to the changing lifestyle of consumers, natural colorants is a research area that is growing (Rodriguez-Amaya 2016).

        <p>Natural colorants can also be classified by their chemical structure: flavonoid derivatives (anthocyanins, flavones and flavonols), isoprenoid derivatives (carotenoids), nitrogen-heterocyclic derivatives (betalains) or pyrrole derivatives (chlorophylls) (Sigurdson, Tang, and Giusti 2017). The occurrence of natural colorants is described in several vegetal tissues, for example, flowers are usually sources of anthocyanins, flavonols, and betalains (Leong et al. 2018;Sigurdson, Tang, and Giusti 2017), roots, such as beet root (Beta vulgaris L.) is the most known source of betalains (Khan 2016;Sigurdson, Tang, and Giusti 2017), and leaves are the mainly source of chlorophylls (Viera, P erez-G alvez, and Roca 2019). This review focuses on the colorants obtained from fruits and their bioresidues as alternatives to artificial colorants, thus, the classes discussed below are based on the main pigments found in fruits: anthocyanins, betalains, carotenoids, chlorophylls, and other non-anthocyanin flavonoids.Natural colorants can also be classified by their chemical structure: flavonoid derivatives (anthocyanins, flavones and flavonols), isoprenoid derivatives (carotenoids), nitrogen-heterocyclic derivatives (betalains) or pyrrole derivatives (chlorophylls) (Sigurdson, Tang, and Giusti 2017).

        <p>Anthocyanins are the most important pigments between flavonoids; they are anthocyanidins bonded to one or more sugar molecules (glycoside form), in turn anthocyanidins consist of an aromatic ring bonded to an heterocyclic ring that contains oxygen, which is also bonded by a carbon-carbon bond at a third aromatic ring. Differences in the number of hydroxyl and methoxyl groups present in the structure characterize the various anthocyanins present in nature, interfering in their color and stability. Hydroxylation increases blue color and reduces stability, while methylation increases redness and increases stability. On the other hand, sugar moieties may be acylated with aromatic and/or aliphatic acids, which has positive effects on the stability (Leong et al. 2018;Rodriguez-Amaya 2018). Anthocyanins absorb light around 500 nm and are responsible for red, pink, violet, and blue colors of several fruits and flowers. There is an extensive number of these molecules present in nature and more than 600 types of anthocyanins have been identified (Zhang, Butelli, and Martin 2014), being the most common based anthocyanidins: cyanidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin, shown in Figure 1A (Zhang, Butelli, and Martin 2014;Li et al. 2017).Anthocyanins are the most important pigments between flavonoids; they are anthocyanidins bonded to one or more sugar molecules (glycoside form), in turn anthocyanidins consist of an aromatic ring bonded to an heterocyclic ring that contains oxygen, which is also bonded by a carbon-carbon bond at a third aromatic ring.

        <p>Anthocyanins are found mainly in fruits, vegetables, and flowers, and their production in plant tissues can be stimulated by stress conditions, pathological infection or by the plant protection system against oxidative damage (Zhang, Butelli, and Martin 2014). Red-purple fruits are usually the sources of these pigments. Table 1 shows anthocyanin-rich fruits.Anthocyanins are found mainly in fruits, vegetables, and flowers, and their production in plant tissues can be stimulated by stress conditions, pathological infection or by the plant protection system against oxidative damage (Zhang, Butelli, and Martin 2014).

        <p>According to data on Table 1, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside is the major anthocyanin in several fruits; this pigment is the most abundant anthocyanin in the plant kingdom and has been reported by its anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-tumor properties (Sun and Li 2018;You et al. 2018). Among the mentioned fruits, bay (Laurus nobilis L.), pagoda dogwood (Cornus alternifolia L.), mulberry (Morus atropurpurea Roxb.), juc ¸ara (Euterpe edulis M.) and haskap (Lonicera caerulea L.) show the highest concentration of anthocyanins (2170 mg/100 g of fresh fruit (ff), 1668 mg/ 100 g ff, 5472 mg/100 g of dry fruit (df), 2956 mg/100 g df and 2273 mg/100 g df, respectively) (Brito et al. 2007;Vareed et al. 2006;Celli, Ghanem, and Brooks 2015;Espada-Bellido et al. 2017). Curiously, bay plant is a very exploited species due to the aromatic and therapeutic properties of its leaves, but very few researches explore its potential as a source of colorants (Longo and Vasapollo 2005). An interesting amount of anthocyanins is also found in small fruits from shrubs, such as Cornus species (18-1668 mg/100 g ff (Vareed et al. 2006)) and wild madder (Rubia peregrina L.) (724 mg/ 100 g ff (Longo, Scardino, and Vasapollo 2007)), which are not usually appreciated for consumption. However, anthocyanins are found in various fruits that are ingested from the regular consumption, such as grapes (Vitis vinifera L.), blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) and strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D). In this way, the use of anthocyanins from natural sources is permitted by EFSA and FDA. EFSA did not establish an ADI for this colorant due to the lack of characterization and toxicity data, thus, the intake as an additive should not exceed the normal intake of these compounds. JECFA has not allocated ADI for anthocyanin's from grape skin extract (EFSA 2013).According to data on Table 1, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside is the major anthocyanin in several fruits; this pigment is the most abundant anthocyanin in the plant kingdom and has been reported by its anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-tumor properties (Sun and Li 2018;You et al. 2018).

        <p>The colors conferred by anthocyanins are of great interest to industry, however their low stability may become a limitation to their application. Among all factors that cause instability, pH is mentioned as the main critical variable, since the color is dependent on the pH of the medium, due to the structural changes occurring in anthocyanins in the presence or absence of acid. In acid solution (pH 1-2), the structure of the anthocyanin is found in the form of flavylium cation (AH þ ), responsible by red color, becomes its stable form. As the pH increases, the cation can be hydrated, forming a carbinol pseudo base that is colorless at pH 4-5 or loses a proton at pH 6-6.5, assuming the form quinonal base of blue color. In solutions with pH 7-9 the tautomerization occurs, opening of the ring, resulting in the pale-yellow chalcone form. At pH &gt; 9.0 it can occur the loss of another proton forming a dark blue ionized base (Zhang et al. 2014). Therefore, anthocyanins are more stable in values of low pH, however, Akogou et al. (2018) reported that alkaline pH provides a better extraction of anthocyanins, namely apigeninidin (3-desoxy-pelargonidin), from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). An explanation for this effect, may be that the alkaline medium can release bounded phenolic compounds present in the plant tissue, and the absence of an hydroxyl group at the C-3 position of this pigment makes it more stable to changes of pH (Rodriguez-Amaya 2018).The colors conferred by anthocyanins are of great interest to industry, however their low stability may become a limitation to their application. Among all factors that cause instability, pH is mentioned as the main critical variable, since the color is dependent on the pH of the medium, due to the structural changes occurring in anthocyanins in the presence or absence of acid. In acid solution (pH 1-2), the structure of the anthocyanin is found in the form of flavylium cation (AH þ ), responsible by red color, becomes its stable form. As the pH increases, the cation can be hydrated, forming a carbinol pseudo base that is colorless at pH 4-5 or loses a proton at pH 6-6.5, assuming the form quinonal base of blue color. In solutions with pH 7-9 the tautomerization occurs, opening of the ring, resulting in the pale-yellow chalcone form. At pH &gt; 9.0 it can occur the loss of another proton forming a dark blue ionized base (Zhang et al. 2014). Therefore, anthocyanins are more stable in values of low pH, however, Akogou et al.

        <p>Other factors that have effects on anthocyanins are temperature and the presence of co-pigments. Among the natural colorants from plant tissues, anthocyanins exhibit better stability in relation to heat. Thus, temperatures above 100 C can lead to their degradation to the chalcone form, which may limit some food processes with natural colorants based on anthocyanins. (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). Co-pigmentation reaction with other substances present in the food matrix, such as phenolic acids, metal ions, and proteins can help to improve their colorant capacity. For example, co-pigmentation with phenolic acids and other non-anthocyanin flavonoids increase the stability of these compounds during thermal processing (90 C) and storage (Fan et al. 2019;Kopjar, Jak si c, and Pili zota 2012). Anthocyanins usually show high stability to light and to the presence of oxygen (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). However, there are various forms already mentioned in literature that stabilize this type of molecules; these aspects will be further discussed in section "Problems posed to natural colorants from fruit origin."Other factors that have effects on anthocyanins are temperature and the presence of co-pigments.

        <p>Betalains color is stable between pH 3-7: betacyanins are most stable in acid pH and betaxanthins in neutral pH; at low pH values the color changes from red to violet-blue and in alkaline medium the conversion of betalains to betalamic acid occurs, which results in color change to yellow-brown. The instability of betalains also occurs in the presence of light, oxygen and metal ions (e.g. Al 3þ , Ni 2þ , Hg 2þ , Fe 2þ , and Cu 2þ ), which may accelerate oxidation of betalains, resulting in color loss. However, heat is the most critical factor in the degradation of these compounds. At high temperature, the aldimine bond hydrolysis and decarboxylation occurs, which makes a color chance to orange-yellow. In order to minimize the effect of the heat over degradation of betalains, it is important to cool down the food matrix after thermal processes and then apply the ingredient (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017; Khan 2016). To overcome these obstacles, stabilization methods have been developed. For example, encapsulation with sorption protein and maltodextrin can increase the stability of these compounds at temperature of 60 C.

        <p>Carotenoids are lipid-soluble pigments that are synthesized by all photosynthetic organisms, which include plants, algae, and microorganisms. In vegetable tissues they are responsible for conferring yellow, orange or red colors. Its main sources are carrots (Daucus carota L.), tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and peppers (Capsicum species) (Rodriguez-Amaya 2018; Saini and Keum 2018). In plants, carotenoids have primary functions, such as a photoprotection against photo-oxidation damage, and secondary functions due to their attractive coloration that attracts animals, which makes possible to disperse pollen from flowers and fruit seeds (Rodriguez-Concepcion et al. 2018). The main carotenoids found in food are: b-carotene, a-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin (Figure 1C) (Rodriguez-Amaya 2016). Carotenoids can also be found in some species of fish (e.g., salmon) and crustaceans (e.g., crab and shrimp) (Rodriguez-Amaya 2018). A large variety of fruits are considered as sources of carotenoids, and some examples are presented in the Table 3. b-carotene is the main carotenoid found in most fruits, according to data present in Table 3. Buriti (Mauritia flexuosa L.) and tucumã (Astrocaryum aculeatum Meyer) show the highest amounts of this pigment, 31.13 and 20.97 mg/ 100 g ff, respectively.

        <p>More than 1000 carotenoids are known, however only 40-50 types are consumed in the human diet (Leong et al. 2018). All carotenoids have a long chain structure, generally they are C 40 tetraterpenoids, with double carbon bonds and bilateral symmetry around the central double bond. Carotenoids are distinguished mainly by the formation of the ring at the ends (cyclic carotenoids) or not (acyclic carotenoids), and by the presence of oxygen atoms. When constituted only by carbon and hydrogen atoms, they are known as carotenes (e.g. b-carotene and lycopene) and when they have oxygen in the structure, they are known as xanthophylls (e.g. b-cryptoxanthin and lutein) (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017; Saini and Keum 2018). This diversity of carotenoids occurs due to reactions of hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, cyclization of the end groups, and oxygen insertion, providing their color characteristics and antioxidant properties (Saini and Keum 2018). The range of maximum absorption (kmax) of carotenoids in the ultraviolet and visible spectra covers values between 286 nm (phytoene) and 470 nm (lycopene), due to their different structures. For carotenoids that are mainly found in vegetal tissue, the kmax of b-carotene, zeaxanthin, and b-cryptoxanthin corresponds to 450 nm; for lutein kmax is 445 nm, and for lycopene 470 nm. These values correspond to the use of ethanol or petroleum ether as solvents (Rodriguez-Amaya 2001).More than 1000 carotenoids are known, however only 40-50 types are consumed in the human diet (Leong et al. 2018).

        <p>Carotenoids are known to have antioxidant capacity and as vitamin A precursors, namely b-carotene, have the ability to reduce cardiovascular disease and display anti-cancer effects (Leong et al. 2018). Lutein and zeaxanthin have been reported as having beneficial properties for vision problems, preventing the Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and cataracts; these pigments are accumulated in ocular cells and have shown efficient quenching of both singlet oxygen and lipid peroxy radicals (Roberts and Dennison 2015). Lycopene is well-known for its prevention of the prostate cancer, but it has also shown promising effects in other tumor cell lines, such as breast, ovarian, gastric, and cervical, besides to its positive effect on cardiovascular disease and other disorders caused by oxidative stress, such as osteoporosis and neurodegenerative damage (Holzapfel et al. 2017;Leong et al. 2018).Carotenoids are known to have antioxidant capacity and as vitamin A precursors, namely b-carotene, have the ability to reduce cardiovascular disease and display anti-cancer effects (Leong et al. 2018).

        <p>The use of carotenoids as a colorant additive is allowed by EFSA and FDA, being coded as: mixed carotenes (E160a (i)), b-carotene (E 160a (ii)), annatto (E160b), paprika extract (E160c), and lycopene (E160d (i) and (ii)). Mixed carotenes are compost by band a-carotene obtained from plant tissues, manly palm fruit (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), carrots (Daucus carota L.), and algae (namely Dunaliella salina and Dunaliella bardawil). b-Carotene can also be obtained from fermentative processes of fungus, namely Blakeslea trispora, but due to the presence of synthetic b-carotene, it is not considered a natural obtained colorant. The ADI for these additives is not determined due to the lack of studies proving their toxicity, however their consumption as food colorant should not exceed the normally ingestion of these compounds (EFSA 2012). Annatto is a natural colorant obtained from seeds of Bixa Orellana L. composed by bixin or norbixin carotenoids. The ADI for annatto depends of the carotenoid content: for bixin is 0.6 mg/kg bw/day and for norbixin is 0.3 mg/kg bw/day (EFSA 2016). Paprika is the colorant obtained from Capsicum annuum L. fruit, also known as pepper or sweet pepper, being composed by capsanthin and capsorubin carotenoids. The ADI for paprika extract is 24 mg/kg bw/day or 1.7 mg of carotenoids/kg bw/ day from paprika extract (EFSA 2015 b). Lycopene colorant can be natural obtained from tomato fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) (E160d (i)), by the fermentation process of Blakeslea trispora fungi (E160d (ii)). The ADI for both is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day (EFSA 2008). Despite of the approval of the main world authorities, EFSA and FDA, the stability of carotenoids may be a limitation for their application in food products. The presence of oxygen, light and temperature may cause oxidation of these compounds due to the amount of unsaturated bonds in their structure, resulting in color change (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). The coloration of carotenoids is also dependent on their aggregations or interactions with other substances, such as proteins and fat (Rodriguez-Concepcion et al. 2018;Saini and Keum 2018). In order to reduce the problems with oxidation it is possible to inactivate oxidative enzymes by bleaching with hot water/steam, however, the heat can cause changes in carotenoid structure, and for this reason the addition of an antioxidant agent, such as citric acid, a-tocopherol, and butylated hydroxyanisol, may be more feasible for the preservation of oxidation (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017).

        <p>Among all pigments present in nature, chlorophylls are the ones that are most abundant in the plant kingdom, being the only ones responsible for the green color found in plant tissues; however, they have been the least studied natural colorants (Rodriguez-Amaya 2016). Five classes of chlorophylls can be found in the plant kingdom, which are chlorophyll a, b, c, d and e; chlorophyll a and b are the most found in several plant tissues and in fruits. The differences found between these compounds are the substituent group, chlorophyll a has a methyl (CH 3 ) which gives a blue-green color, while chlorophyll b has an aldehyde (CHO), that confers a yellow-green color. Usually these two forms of chlorophyll may be found together in plants in a ratio of 3:1 (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). Leaves are generally the main sources of chlorophyll, nevertheless, their presence in fruits may occur before maturation process and synthesis of other pigments (Viera, P erez-G alvez, and Roca 2019). Moreover, green fruits have significant amounts of chlorophyll throughout their lifetime. Table 4 shows some fruits that can be alternative sources of this pigment.Among all pigments present in nature, chlorophylls are the ones that are most abundant in the plant kingdom, being the only ones responsible for the green color found in plant tissues; however, they have been the least studied natural colorants (Rodriguez-Amaya 2016).

        <p>As a colorant, chlorophylls obtained from edible plant material or not (e.g. grass, lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) or nettle (Urtica dioica L.) can be used as natural colorants, such as chlorophylls (E140 (i)) and chlorophyllins (E140 (ii)), the latter being the colorant produced by saponification of the chlorophyll extract (EFSA 2015c; EFSA 2015d). The color additives copper complexes of chlorophylls, also known as Cu-chlorophylls E141(i), and copper complexes of chlorophyllins, also known as Cu-chlorophyllins E141 (ii), and sodium copper chlorophyllin in the USA, are manufactured from chlorophylls obtained from natural sources with addition of a copper, which causes the replacement of Mg 2þ ions in the center of tetrapyrroles in chlorophyll with Cu 2þ ions, and makes the pigment more stable, but due to this process these additives are not considered natural. These four colorants are allowed in the EU, yet, EFSA, in the last reevaluation of color additives, finished in 2016, considered that there were a few studies on the toxicity and absorption by the human body of these substances and therefore, it was not possible to establish a value of ADI safe for the human consumption (EFSA, 2015f). In the USA, the FDA allows the use of sodium copper chlorophyllins with ADI of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day. The acidic pH and the high temperature are crucial factors over the stability of chlorophylls, in which it can occur the formation of several distinct derivatives, changing the color from green to brown; this reaction is known as pheophytinization, and results into the conversion of chlorophylls to Mg 2þ free derivatives, such as pheophytins and pyropheophytin (Pumilia et al. 2014).As a colorant, chlorophylls obtained from edible plant material or not (e.g. grass, lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) or nettle (Urtica dioica L.) can be used as natural colorants, such as chlorophylls (E140 (i)) and chlorophyllins (E140 (ii)), the latter being the colorant produced by saponification of the chlorophyll extract (EFSA 2015c; EFSA 2015d).

        <p>In addition to the compounds mentioned above, other molecules found in fruits can promote color, more specifically the yellowness. A promising class of natural food colorants is non-anthocyanin phenolic compounds, namely flavonols (myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol) and flavones (luteolin and apigenin) (Figure 1E). In fact, non-anthocyanin phenolic compounds do not have legislation as food additives; despite their wide recognition as prominent antioxidants, health promoters and functional food ingredients, the use of this large group of bioactive molecules as food colorants remains little investigated (Martins et al. 2016).In addition to the compounds mentioned above, other molecules found in fruits can promote color, more specifically the yellowness.

        <p>Briefly a contextualization of the main flavonols and flavones found in fruits will be stated. Flavonols (3-hydroxyflavones) are known to confer a yellow coloration in plant tissues. In general, they are sensitive to the presence of light and easily photo-oxidized, which promotes the appearance of a darker coloration. Quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin are the most common flavonols in nature. In fruits, they are present mainly as quercetin (Sultana and Anwar 2008;Miean and Mohamed 2001). Thus, this review will give more focus on this compound.Briefly a contextualization of the main flavonols and flavones found in fruits will be stated.

        <p>The quercetin aglycone has a crystal form with brilliant yellow color and poorly water soluble. The glycosylation with sugar molecules, mainly glucose, rhamnose and rutinose, promote the formation of quercetin glycoside derivatives, which increases its solubility in water. Natural occurrence of quercetin in fruits and vegetables is in its glycoside form. However, the acid present in the composition of vegetal tissue, may cause its hydrolysis into quercetin and the sugar moieties (Kumar, Vijayalakshmi, and Nadanasabapathi 2017;Li et al. 2016). The term quercetin refers only to the aglycone, thus in research, it is typically used to quantify the total quercetin-type molecules, including its glycoside (Li et al. 2016). These compounds are widely distributed in fruits and some examples can be seen in Table 5. Onions (Allium cepa L.) are known as the main source of quercetin and its derivatives ($14 mg/100 g of fresh weight) (Kumar, Vijayalakshmi, and Nadanasabapathi 2017). Elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) presents a high content of quercetin derivatives (35.59 mg/100 g ff) (Veberic et al. 2009); surpassing the content found in onions and apples (Malus pumila Mill.) (1.19 mg/100 g ff) (Sultana and Anwar 2008), that are considered a source of these flavonols.

        <p>Quercetin and its derivatives have been widely reported for their beneficial properties in health; generally they are known due to their antioxidant, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative effects, and its usage in the prevention of neurodegeneration and cardiovascular diseases, and cytoprotective activity (Kumar, Vijayalakshmi, and Nadanasabapathi 2017;Li et al. 2016). However, its colorant capacity has been little exploited by the food industry. On the other hand, there are several studies directed to the production of natural colorants for the textile industry based on quercetin (Yan, Pan, and Ji 2018).Quercetin and its derivatives have been widely reported for their beneficial properties in health; generally they are known due to their antioxidant, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative effects, and its usage in the prevention of neurodegeneration and cardiovascular diseases, and cytoprotective activity (Kumar, Vijayalakshmi, and Nadanasabapathi 2017;Li et al. 2016).

        <p>In food products, Cavin et al. (2013) used quercetin and its derivatives to promote the browning in foodstuffs heated by microwave oven, to simulate the color developed by Maillard reaction, that occurs during the baking/cooking with high temperature. The yellow-brownish color obtained by quercetin after heat can be intensified with the use of a chemical base, such as sodium bicarbonate, which effects on the breakdown of quercetin glycosides.In food products, Cavin et al.

        <p>The extraction of quercetin from plant matrices is benefited by alkaline media, due to quercetin glycoside breaking down and the rupture of cell wall. In relation to quercetin stability, acid or alkaline solutions cause the conversion of quercetin glycoside into its aglycone form, and light has oxidative effect on them. Quercetin and its derivatives have shown stability during thermal processing (Li et al. 2016). The use of quercetin as a colorant additive has not yet been evaluated by regulatory authorities. However, these compounds are consumed daily. In Spain, for example, the consumption of these compounds is about 18.48 mg/day and in the USA is 9.75 mg/day (Li et al. 2016). These values are lower than the daily doses of quercetin ingestion recommended of 250-600 mg per day for the promotion of their health benefits (Kumar, Vijayalakshmi, and Nadanasabapathi 2017).The extraction of quercetin from plant matrices is benefited by alkaline media, due to quercetin glycoside breaking down and the rupture of cell wall.

        <p>There is an immense range of flavones, thus the bestknown and occurring in higher amounts in plants is apigenin. Apigenin is a yellow crystalline powder, being the aglycone of several naturally occurring glycosides. Glycosylation of apigenin may occur by hydroxyl substitutions at positions 4 0 , 5, and 7 of the basic flavonoid skeleton (Ali et al. 2017). It is insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents. This pigment occurs mainly in flowers, where one of the most common sources is chamomile (Chamomilla matricaria L.), with about of 320 mg/100 g of dry weight, but vegetables and fruits can also contain this flavone. Table 5 presents the content of apigenin and its derivatives found in some fruits. Guava (Psidium guajava L.), belimbi (Averrhoa belimbi L.) and bell pepper (Capsicum annum L.) are the fruits with the highest apigenin content, with 57.9, 45.8 and 27.2 mg/100 g df, respectively. A relative high amount of this pigment can also be found in some berries, such as blackthorn (Prunus spinosa L.) and sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.).There is an immense range of flavones, thus the bestknown and occurring in higher amounts in plants is apigenin.

        <p>The extraction of the pigments from the plant matrix is a crucial step for the success of obtaining natural colorants, since these substances, such as anthocyanins, betalains, carotenoids, and chlorophylls, are sensitive to temperature, presence of oxygen, light, among other factors. Therefore, several studies evaluate different methods of extraction of these colorant compounds (Saini and Keum 2018;Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017;Martins and Ferreira 2017). Moreover, it is necessary to consider the peculiarities of the plant matrix that contain the desired pigment.

        <p>Several extraction techniques are applied to obtain natural colorants; the choose of the best method to extract these compounds is essential to make a process viable and sustainable. These techniques are defined as conventional, such as is the case of Soxhlet (Sox) and maceration (MA), or noconventional, such as microwave assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and high pressure extraction (HPE). Non-conventional techniques have been referred to as "green extraction methods" due to the use of less energy and solvent, being considered environmentally friendly.Several extraction techniques are applied to obtain natural colorants; the choose of the best method to extract these compounds is essential to make a process viable and sustainable.

        <p>Conventional techniques are simple methods that do not require great skills. Sox is traditionally known as a method for lipid extraction; however, it has also been used to obtain bioactive compounds. In the case of pigments, Sox has shown good yields for carotenoids and anthocyanins. For example, this conventional method was around 13% more efficient in carotenoids extraction from kaki (Diospyros kaki L.), apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) and peach (Prunus persica L.) fruits than PLE (Zaghdoudi et al. 2015). For anthocyanins extraction from bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) residue, Sox presented almost double the yield obtained under conditions optimized for PLE, 457 and 254 mg of anthocyanins/100 g of extract, respectively (Paes et al. 2014). However, this method is generally applied only in order to evaluate the efficiency of other methods, not being employable at industrial level due the long extraction time and amount of solvent that are required to process (Saini and Keum 2018).Conventional techniques are simple methods that do not require great skills.

        <p>Extraction by MA does not require great technology and can be conducted at room temperature, which is interesting for obtaining thermosensitive pigments, such as betalains (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). However, MA with heat (also known as heat assisted extraction (HAE)) can increase the solubility of target compounds and reduce the extraction time. The efficiency of MA is dependent on the solubility of the pigment from the fruit matrix in the extraction solvent (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017;Saini and Keum 2018). Although these methodologies facilitate mass transfer between the different phases of the system, it consumes a lot of energy and time, which can be unviable for an industrial scale production, and can also result in the degradation of thermosensitive compounds, except in the extraction by maceration without heat (Ngamwonglumlert et al. 2017). Optimized conditions can make this method more efficient in relation to the obtained yield versus extraction time. According to data shown Table 6, the optimum extraction of anthocyanins from strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.) by MA consumed only 5 min (yield of 38.2 mg of anthocyanins/100 g of dry weight (L opez et al. 2018), and to obtain optimum yield of betalains from xoconostle (Opuntia joconostle cv.) it was only necessary 10 min (yield of 92 mg of betalains/100 g of fresh weight (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. 2013).Extraction by MA does not require great technology and can be conducted at room temperature, which is interesting for obtaining thermosensitive pigments, such as betalains (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017).

        <p>UAE is a non-conventional method which has shown an actual effect in obtaining compounds. This method is usually applied in either solid/fluid media and consists in the transmission of ultrasound waves by cavitation, allowing the rupture of the plant tissue, facilitating the extraction of intracellular molecules, for this reason, the extraction by UAE may be faster than by conventional extraction and require less solvent, and in addition, UAE can be applied without heat (Saini and Keum 2018;Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). Thus, this method is an interesting methodology to be applied in the extraction of natural colorants, since it allows the extraction of molecules at lower temperatures and can be used for both hydro and lipid soluble pigments depending on the solvent. According to data shown in Table 6, efficient results by UAE have been obtained in the extraction of anthocyanins, betalains, and carotenoids. For example, UAE was more efficient than ME and MAE for anthocyanins extraction from fig (Ficus carica L.) peel (Backes et al. 2018). For carotenoids extraction, namely lycopene from tomato, the yield by UAE was higher in 26% than the one obtained by conventional method (MA) (Eh and Teoh 2012). However, the same success of UAE was not obtained with fruits of strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.); for this plant matrix HAE showed a slight increase in the yield with less time (L opez et al. 2018). This shows that the specificity of the extraction can change according to the characteristics of the fruit matrix. MAE is a simple technique that allows the extraction of hydro and liposoluble compounds. Generally, the extraction by MAE requires less time and solvent than that carried out by conventional methods. These advantages are consequence of the rupture of vegetal cells caused by microwaves radiation, allowing a great transference of the targeted compounds to the solvent (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017; Saini and Keum 2018). For pigments extraction, MAE has been reported by several authors as the most efficient technology, as shown in Table 6. MAE provides the possibility to obtain lycopene from tomato in relatively short time under optimum conditions. The same can be observed for anthocyanins extraction from mulberry (Morus atropurpurea Roxb.) (Zou et al. 2012). In comparison with the UAE method for anthocyanins extraction from fig peel, MAE was slightly less efficient in the extraction yield (432 and 411 mg/100 g dry weight by UAE and MAE, respectively); however, the UAE required an extraction time 4 times longer than the MAE to achieve optimal results (21 and 5 min, respectively) (Backes et al. 2018), thus the extraction efficiency per time may also be an interesting parameter for the employment of this method at industrial scale.UAE is a non-conventional method which has shown an actual effect in obtaining compounds.

        <p>The SFE consists in the use of a solvent at its critical point with a defined temperature and pressure, at which point the solvent has gas and liquid properties (Supercritical fluid), allowing a greater efficiency in the extraction due to the higher penetration of the solvent into the matrix (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is normally used as the solvent for several reasons: (i) its critical temperature and pressure are 31.2 C and 74 bars, respectively, which are not so high, therefore the extraction of heat-sensitive compounds is possible; (ii) as a solvent it is harmless to the environment and to human health; iii) the oxidation reactions are limited due to the absence of air (Saini and Keum 2018). Due to the CO 2 polarity, the SFE methodology is mainly applied to the extraction of non-polar compounds, such as carotenoids (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017; Saini and Keum 2018). However, with the addition of a polar cosolvent, also known as modifier, such as ethanol and water, it is possible to obtain other hydro-soluble pigments, such as betalains and anthocyanins. Table 6 shows examples of optimized SFE of these compounds. According to Table 6, ethanol has also been used as co-solvent for carotenoids extraction, which can be explained by the presence of slightly polar carotenoids in the xanthophyll class (Baysal, Ersus, and Starmans 2000). However, it is important to emphasize that the efficient use of SFE with co-solvent requires a massive study about the proportion that provides the best solubility of the target compounds and yields, as reported by Seabra et al. (2010). In their study, the extraction of anthocyanins from elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) pomace was evaluated, using 30 different combinations of CO 2 and co-solvents (ethanol (EtOH) and water (H 2 O)). They found lower yield (1.7%) using 90% CO 2 :8% EtOH: 2% H 2 O, and higher yield (21.3%) with 20% CO 2 :40% EtOH:40% H 2 O. Also, according with data present in Table 6, the proportion CO 2 , ethanol and water, 90%, 5% and 5% respectively, was more efficient in the extraction of anthocyanins from juc ¸ara (Euterpe edulis M.) (Garcia-mendoza et al. 2017;Garcia-mendoza et al. 2017), and bilberry residue (Paes et al. 2014).The SFE consists in the use of a solvent at its critical point with a defined temperature and pressure, at which point the solvent has gas and liquid properties (Supercritical fluid), allowing a greater efficiency in the extraction due to the higher penetration of the solvent into the matrix (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is normally used as the solvent for several reasons: (i) its critical temperature and pressure are 31.2 C and 74 bars, respectively, which are not so high, therefore the extraction of heat-sensitive compounds is possible; (ii) as a solvent it is harmless to the environment and to human health; iii) the oxidation reactions are limited due to the absence of air (Saini and Keum 2018). Due to the CO 2 polarity, the SFE methodology is mainly applied to the extraction of non-polar compounds, such as carotenoids (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017; Saini and Keum 2018). However, with the addition of a polar cosolvent, also known as modifier, such as ethanol and water, it is possible to obtain other hydro-soluble pigments, such as betalains and anthocyanins. Table 6 shows examples of optimized SFE of these compounds. According to Table 6, ethanol has also been used as co-solvent for carotenoids extraction, which can be explained by the presence of slightly polar carotenoids in the xanthophyll class (Baysal, Ersus, and Starmans 2000). However, it is important to emphasize that the efficient use of SFE with co-solvent requires a massive study about the proportion that provides the best solubility of the target compounds and yields, as reported by Seabra et al. (2010).

        <p>Another method based on high pressure extraction is PLE, which is also known for its efficiency and for being more ecological. PLE, also known as accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), is a method employed to the use of a liquid solvent at high pressure (10.3-13.8 MPa) combined with high temperature. Non-polar and polar solvents can be used in PLE, allowing the extraction of several compounds. However, this technique is not recommended for heat-sensitive molecules (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). The penetration of the solvent into the vegetal cell is favored by high pressure, that cause deformation or cell membrane damage, meanwhile the heat decreases the solvent viscosity, which provides a favorable condition for the mass transfer (Saini and Keum 2018;Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017).Another method based on high pressure extraction is PLE, which is also known for its efficiency and for being more ecological.

        <p>Examples of colorants optimization processes using PLE can be visualized in Table 6. The optimized yield of carotenoids extracted from kaki (Diospyros kaki L.), apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) and peach (Prunus persica L.) was obtained by applying a low temperature (40 C) and a shorttime (5 min) extraction period, due to the application of an adequate pressure (103 bar) and most appropriate solvents, in this case tetrahydrofuran (moderate polar and aprotic solvent for non-polar carotenoids) and methanol (polar carotenoids, such as xanthophylls) (Zaghdoudi et al. 2015). Temperature also had no effect on the yield of anthocyanins extraction from ac ¸ai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) pulp, which contradicts the effect of high temperatures on the extraction efficiency of these compounds (Alc azar-Alay et al. 2017).Examples of colorants optimization processes using PLE can be visualized in Table 6.

        <p>Meanwhile, the extraction efficiency of anthocyanins from blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) and grumixama (Eugenia brasiliensis Lam.) residues using PLE in relation to UAE was lower (Machado et al. 2017); according to the authors, high pressure and high temperature may have occasioned the degradation of anthocyanins. HPE, also known as high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), was developed with the aim of extracting bioactive molecules. As well as in PLE method, the high pressure (100-900 MPa) causes damage in plant cells, facilitating the extraction of targeted compounds. As opposed to PLE, this method does not require the use of heat, which avoids the thermal degradation and loss of bioactivity of the compounds (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017; Saini and Keum 2018). Thus, this method is interesting in the obtainment of natural colorants, since it does not require high temperatures, thus the extraction of pigments using HPE from fruits has not yet been investigated. However, according to Table 6, HPE has been mainly applied for the recovery of pigments from tomato and grape residue. The low time observed for the recovery of antho-($ 3.5 min) and lycopene (1-10 min) from grape and tomato, respectively, may be a consequence of the effect of high pressure on the solvent permeability in the fruit cells (Putnik et al. 2018;Xi 2006). This method may also be of interest in the selectivity of the pigment. Corrales et al. (2009) reported that optimum anthocyanins' extraction conditions are dependent on the compounds structure, being the extraction of anthocyanin monoglucosides from grape skin more efficient applying lower pressures (200 MPa), whereas pressures of 600 MPa were optimal for the extraction of acylglucosides. Thus, the pressure variation may be important to obtain more stable molecules (acylglucoside).Meanwhile, the extraction efficiency of anthocyanins from blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) and grumixama (Eugenia brasiliensis Lam.) residues using PLE in relation to UAE was lower (Machado et al. 2017); according to the authors, high pressure and high temperature may have occasioned the degradation of anthocyanins.

        <p>The success of a natural colorant extraction depends on several factors, such as the solubility of the target compound in the solvent employed, the solid/solvent ratio, the temperature, and other factors specific to each extraction method (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017;Saini and Keum 2018;Pinela et al. 2016).The success of a natural colorant extraction depends on several factors, such as the solubility of the target compound in the solvent employed, the solid/solvent ratio, the temperature, and other factors specific to each extraction method (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017;Saini and Keum 2018;Pinela et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>The solubility of the compounds is an important factor in the choice of the extraction solvent. Anthocyanins and betalains are water-soluble compounds, therefore they have greater affinity with water; however, several studies present a better yield in the extraction of these compounds with the use of methanol (Dranca and Oroian 2016;Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. 2013) and ethanol solution (Celli, Ghanem, and Brooks 2015). Carotenoids and chlorophylls are oil-soluble, therefore they are soluble in organic solvents, such as acetone, chloroform, methanol and N,N-dimethylformamide (Saini and Keum 2018;Delgado-Pelayo, Gallardo-Guerrero, and Hornero-M endez 2014). In fruits with a high water content, a step of dehydration is recommended prior to the extraction of carotenoids to increase the efficiency of the process (Saini and Keum 2018).The solubility of the compounds is an important factor in the choice of the extraction solvent.

        <p>The solid/solvent ratio is another very important variable that may implicate the transfer of colorant compounds from the plant matrix to the solvent. For anthocyanins extraction from haskap (Lonicera caerulea L.) fruit the increase of the proportion of liquid positively improved the yield effect, indicating that in proportions lower than 25:1 (mL/g), solvent saturation may occur (Celli, Ghanem, and Brooks 2015). On the other hand, the same observation was not detected in the extraction of betalains from prickly pears (Opuntia ficus-indica Mill.) fruit, in which the authors concluded that the increase of the mass of the fruit caused greater extraction yield (Maran, Manikandan, and Mekala 2013).The solid/solvent ratio is another very important variable that may implicate the transfer of colorant compounds from the plant matrix to the solvent.

        <p>The heat in the extraction process is a responsible variable that can increase the solubility of the organic compounds in the solvent. However, colorant compounds tend to be degraded at high temperature. In general, betalains are more sensitive to heat, followed by carotenoids and chlorophylls, thus anthocyanins exhibit higher resistance to temperature (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. (2013) determined that increasing the temperature from 5 to 30 C reduced the extraction yield of betalains from Xoconostle (Opuntia joconostle cv.) in about 10%. On the other hand, Maran, Manikandan, and Mekala (2013) observed that increasing the temperature to 46 C provided greater solubility of the betalains present in prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica Mill) during the extraction process. Similar results were also found for carotenoids, namely crocin, from gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides Ellis) fruit, where the optimum extraction condition was reached at 70 C (Yang, Liu, and Gao 2009) and for anthocyanins from strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.) at 90 C (L opez et al. 2018). However, the binomial time and temperature are usually crucial for the success of an extraction, since the heat has effect on the solubility of the compounds, but can cause their degradation.The heat in the extraction process is a responsible variable that can increase the solubility of the organic compounds in the solvent.

        <p>Some classes of colorants have sensitivity to changes in pH, which may be a negative factor for extraction. For example, chlorophylls may be easily degraded to pheophytin in an acidic medium, which causes a change of color to brown, therefore the addition of alkaline substances help kept the stability of these compounds. On the other hand, anthocyanins are more stable in acidic pH, and the increase of pH to alkaline (pH 8-9) results in the degradation of these compounds. The adjustment of pH with acid, such as citric, hydrochloric and trifluoracetic acids, is a frequent practice for the preservation of these compounds during the extraction process. Nevertheless, betalains and carotenoids are more stable to pH changes (Khan 2016;Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017). Moreover, for the extraction of betalains (namely betanin) and anthocyanins, it is commonly used an acidic solution with citric, ascorbic or hydrochloric acids to prevent the degradation of the compounds (Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017).Some classes of colorants have sensitivity to changes in pH, which may be a negative factor for extraction.

        <p>Fruit sources: Natural colorants from fruits can be found in species that do not have a cultivation system, which can hinder access and eliminate the availability of the material. This point is crucial and needs to be considered for these matrices to be a possible source of colorant compounds for the industrial extraction (Bernal-Mercado et al. 2018). Alternative sources of natural colorants may be a good option to increase the demand for natural compounds as food additives; however, the new source of pigments would require a safety assessment by regulatory agencies, which are expensive and require a long time (Martins et al. 2016). Another problem accounted to the use of these matrices as natural colorants is the differences found in the composition between cultivars and the maturation periods, which can also influence the direct extraction yield and the stability of the compounds (Rodriguez-Amaya 2016).Fruit sources: Natural colorants from fruits can be found in species that do not have a cultivation system, which can hinder access and eliminate the availability of the material.

        <p>Stability of natural colorants: In general, natural colorants are less stable than artificial. Several factors, as mentioned above, such as heat, pH changes, presence of light, oxygen, and metal ions may cause the instability during the extraction, food processing and shelf-life of the product (Rodriguez-Amaya 2016; Ngamwonglumlert, Devahastin, and Chiewchan 2017; Martins et al. 2016). The use of more appropriate extraction technologies may require a higher investment cost and the extraction process requires higher control of the conditions at an industrial scale. Normally the use of natural colorants is more difficult than the use of the artificial counterparts. However, natural compounds may have a positive influence on the conservation of food product. For example, the addition of anthocyanins' rich extract from Karanda fruit in fermented pork sausage, provided an increase of 100% in its shelf-life, from 10 to 20 days, in relation to the control product without preservative additive, which may be beneficial to the production chain and for alternative substitution of artificial preservatives (Sueprasarn, Reabroy, and Pirak 2017).Stability of natural colorants: In general, natural colorants are less stable than artificial.

        <p>The stability conditions of natural pigments limit their application in food matrices, such as anthocyanins, that are more stable in foodstuff with low pH. Montibeller et al. (2018) applied anthocyanins from by-products of grape into kefir (pH 4.5) and carbonated water; as result, the authors concluded that better color stability was achieved for the kefir product, since half-live time of the total anthocyanins was of 27 days and for the carbonated water stored in the dark, half-life time was shorter (only 6 days), which could be influenced due to the type of food matrix over the anthocyanins' stability. Betalains are more sensible to the increase of temperature, therefore their application is limited to foods produced with a minimum heat treatment, such as cooled and frozen food products (Martins et al. 2017). Carotenoids are lipid soluble pigments, except crocin, consequently they are selected for the inclusion in foodstuffs with higher fat content (Rodriguez-Amaya 2001; Martins et al. 2016). In addition to their low stability, natural colorants from fruits have a more limited range of colors than artificial colorants, and are more expensive (Martins et al. 2016).The stability conditions of natural pigments limit their application in food matrices, such as anthocyanins, that are more stable in foodstuff with low pH.

        <p>However, some of the mentioned problems with instability and solubility can be overcome by employing different stabilization techniques, such as thus shown in Table 7. Stabilization methods have effect mainly on the thermal degradation by heat-process and storage. Betalains, which are the most sensitive pigments to heat, have shown higher stability during storage at 60 C when encapsulated with a protein and maltodextrin/insulin (Robert et al. 2015). In addition, according to data in Table 7, stabilization methods can have effect on the solubility of the compound; for example, the stabilization by molecular inclusion with b-cyclodextrin or nanoencapsulation with gelatin, provided solubility of up to 98 À 100% of carotenoid compounds in aqueous solution (Horuz and Beliba glı 2018;Lobo et al. 2018).However, some of the mentioned problems with instability and solubility can be overcome by employing different stabilization techniques, such as thus shown in Table 7.

        <p>Consumer acceptance: The addition of natural colorants from fruits to enhance the color attribute may reduce the consumer's sensory acceptance, for example, the addition of anthocyanins from jabuticaba (Myrciaria cauliflora Berg.) peel into fresh sausage, decreased the liking score to the color attribute in relation to the sausage without colorant or with carmine colorant (E120) (Baldin et al. 2016). Effects over other attributes, such as flavor and odor, may also be observed with the addition of natural compounds. Kaimainen et al. (2015) evaluated the acceptability of natural colorants based on betalains from beetroot and anthocyanins from grapes in different concentrations in model juice; as a result, it was observed that the increase in the concentration of beetroot power as a colorant reduced significantly the acceptability of the attributed flavor, being the product characterized as unpleasant and strange, which did not occur with the addition of anthocyanins. However, the same effect was observed with the incorporation of grape marc power into fettuccini pasta (Sant'Anna et al. 2014). On the other hand, the addition of the natural colorant from beetroot in flavored milk, increased the sensory scores of color, flavor and acceptability in relation to product control without colorant (Kavitkar et al. 2017). The same was observed in the incorporation of 2 to 3% of lycopene from tomato peels in ice cream, which increased acceptability, also presenting a higher texture score (Rizk, El-Kady, and El-Bialy 2014). Other studies have shown that the use of natural pigments in foodstuff have been very well acceptable, such as banana fruit spread with the addition of betalains from pigeon berry (Rivina humilis L.) (Khan et al. 2015).Consumer acceptance: The addition of natural colorants from fruits to enhance the color attribute may reduce the consumer's sensory acceptance, for example, the addition of anthocyanins from jabuticaba (Myrciaria cauliflora Berg.) peel into fresh sausage, decreased the liking score to the color attribute in relation to the sausage without colorant or with carmine colorant (E120) (Baldin et al. 2016).

        <p>Recently, there is a new direction in the use of wastes and by-products, rich in bioactive and pigment compounds from the food industry, to produce natural additives, including coloring agents (Martins and Ferreira 2017). Food wastes can be defined as "any food or inedible part of food removed from the food supply chain to be recovered or dispose" and by-product as "a substance or object, resulting from a production process, the primary aim of which is not the production of that item" (Stenmarck et al. 2016). In Europe, food waste production is estimated to reach 88 million tonnes per year, which costs around 148 billion euros per year, the primary production and food processing corresponding about 9 and 17 million tonnes, respectively (Stenmarck et al. 2016). By-products and wastes of the food processing based on fruit may account for a large percentage of the fruit weight; these estimations included edible and inedible parts of food. It has been estimated that around 45% of the fruit is converted into waste and losses during the production chain, for example the by-product and waste of mango, namely pomace, seeds and peels, may correspond to 10-60% of the fruit weight, the by-product from apple juice processed represents about 25% of the processed fruit, and in the winery it is generated a waste corresponding to 30% of the production (Bernal-Mercado et al. 2018).Recently, there is a new direction in the use of wastes and by-products, rich in bioactive and pigment compounds from the food industry, to produce natural additives, including coloring agents (Martins and Ferreira 2017).

        <p>Part B of Tables 12345, show the amount of pigment recovery from fruit residues, where it can be noticed that fruit peels, which are generally rejected from processing and/or consumption, are promising sources of natural colorants. This is the case of litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) (772.16 mg of anthocyanins/100 g dry peel) (Liu et al. 2013); avocado (Persea americana Mill.) (57.3 mg of anthocyanins/100 g of fresh peel, 238.6 mg of quercetin/100 g of extract peel, and 59 mg of chlorophylls/100 g of fresh peel) (Cox et al. 2004;Melgar et al. 2018); jabuticaba (Myrciaria cauliflora Berg.) (490 mg of anthocyanins/100 g of dry peel) (Rodrigues et al. 2015); and melon (Cucumis melo L.) (78 mg of chlorophylls/ 100 g of fresh peel) (Shao, Tan, and Li 2016). Moreover, fruit residues from the food industry are already used as natural colorants, such as the case of grape and blueberry pomace from winery ($370 and 415 mg of anthocyanins/ 100 g of dry weight, respectively) (Putnik et al. 2018;He et al. 2016); and tomato residues from production of sauce (30.9 mg of lycopene/100 g of dry weight) (Baysal, Ersus, and Starmans 2000).Part B of Tables 12345, show the amount of pigment recovery from fruit residues, where it can be noticed that fruit peels, which are generally rejected from processing and/or consumption, are promising sources of natural colorants.

        <p>The use of waste and by-products not only benefits the development of additives for the food industry, but may also be interesting for other industrial areas, such as the case of natural pigments for the textile industry obtained from byproducts, namely peels, from eggplant (Mazeyar 2009). Therefore, there is an extensive market that can benefit from the recovery of natural pigments from fruit bio-residues, as well as the environmental.The use of waste and by-products not only benefits the development of additives for the food industry, but may also be interesting for other industrial areas, such as the case of natural pigments for the textile industry obtained from byproducts, namely peels, from eggplant (Mazeyar 2009).

        <p>In this context, there is a better use and valorization of natural sources, less economic losses, and decrease of the food industry impact in the environment, thus contributing to a circular economy (Bernal-Mercado et al. 2018;Martins and Ferreira 2017).In this context, there is a better use and valorization of natural sources, less economic losses, and decrease of the food industry impact in the environment, thus contributing to a circular economy (Bernal-Mercado et al. 2018;Martins and Ferreira 2017).</p>
        <p>In recent years, a new perspective on the use of food additives has gained strength due to several studies pointing some problems related to the use of artificial additives, including colorants. Otherwise, consumer habits have tended to search for functional foods, which promote healthier benefits. In parallel with the worldwide problems of food security, which are associated with political, social, and economic factors, it is required a greater attention to minimize losses and to better use the products of great biological value. Fruits and their residues are a great source of different pigments that provide an attractive range of colorations for application in food products, in addition to their richness in bioactive compounds, being alternatives to artificial colorants. However, studies are still needed to better understand the behavior of these natural compounds during extraction and stabilization processes for their incorporation into food matrices, as well as further research for the purposes of regulation approvals.In recent years, a new perspective on the use of food additives has gained strength due to several studies pointing some problems related to the use of artificial additives, including colorants.
