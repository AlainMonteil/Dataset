        <p>Agriculture research aims to increase food production and quality while lowering costs and boosting profits [1]. Fruit trees play an important role in any state's economic development. One of the most well-known fruit plant species is the citrus plant, which is high in vitamin C and widely used in the Indian sub-Continent, Middle East and Africa [2]. Citrus plants are associated with many health advantages, as well as being used as a raw material in the agricultural industry for the production of several types of other agri-products including jams, sweets, ice cream, and confectionery etc. [2,3]. Citrus, Pakistan's most important fruit crop, accounts for a significant portion of the country's horticultural exports. In 2018, the annual citrus production in Pakistan was estimated to be around 2.5 million tonnes 1 . However, Citrus fruit plants, on the other hand, are susceptible to a variety of infections, including Black spot, canker, scab, greening, and Melanose. The canker is highly contagious and is found in citrus trees and is mostly on the leaves or fruit. There are reports of crop losses of approximately 22% in Kinnow, 25-40% in sweet orange, 15% in grease, 10% in sweet lime and 2% in lemon, respectively. A large proportion of quality export fruit is refused every year due to signs of citrus fruit diseases 1 . As a result, timely identification of citrus diseases has the potential to reduce losses and costs while also improving product quality. For decades, identification of diseases has mostly been done by humans. The recognition and diagnosis process is judgmental, error-prone, time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, new diseases will arise in previously unidentified areas where there is, by necessity, no local expert knowledge to address them [4]. As a result, there is a pressing need for an automated system for detecting citrus fruit/leaf diseases. The development of sophisticated tools and rapid computer-assisted techniques have made it easier to scan and automatically detect anomalies in a crop in real time [4]. Conventional machine learning techniques have had considerable success in recognizing and diagnosing plant disease, but they are limited to the following sequential image processing tasks: image segmentation using clustering and other methods [5,6], feature extraction [7], and pattern recognition using support vector machines (SVM) [8], k-nearest neighbor method [9], and Artificial Neural Network [10]. It is difficult to pick and extract the best observable pathological characteristics, necessitating the use of highly qualified engineers and experienced specialists, which is not only arbitrary but also inefficient of manpower and financial capital.Agriculture research aims to increase food production and quality while lowering costs and boosting profits [1].

        <p>Deep learning, on the other hand, can learn the hierarchical features of pathologies automatically, eliminating the need to manually design the morphological operations of feature extraction and classifier. The deep learning approach excels in several fields, including signal processing [10], pedestrian detection [11], face recognition [12], road crack detection [13], biomedical image analysis [14], and many others. Furthermore, deep learning techniques have produced promising results throughout the agricultural field, helping more farmers and food-producing workers, such as detection of plant disease [15], analysis of weeds [16], discovery of valuable seeds [17], insect detection [18], fruit processing [15], and so on, which has led to dealing with image analysis. Furthermore, a few implementations aimed to forecast future parameters such as crop production [19], climate conditions [20], and field soil water content [21]. We propose an integrated deep learning model, for automated citrus fruit disease detection, based on the tremendous results of CNN-based methods in image classification.Deep learning, on the other hand, can learn the hierarchical features of pathologies automatically, eliminating the need to manually design the morphological operations of feature extraction and classifier.

        <p>Existing research [7, 22, 23, 24,] on the classification of citrus diseases from images uses supervised machine learning and deep learning methods. Liu et al. [24] used a deep learning model for citrus disease classification from photographic images. Furthermore, there is some performance degradation due to poor parameter and layer selection in the neural network model. However, in the suggested CNN model for classifying citrus diseases in both fruit and leaf images, we use a revised number of layers and parameter settings. Furthermore, we run experiments with various CNN model variants and compare the findings to the baseline studies. We suggest a CNN model for effectively classifying citrus diseases from fruit and leaf images. The proposed system can detect the following citrus plant diseases: Black spot, canker, scab, greening, and Melanose.Existing research [7, 22, 23, 24,] on the classification of citrus diseases from images uses supervised machine learning and deep learning methods.

        <p>In this paper, we formulate the identification of citrus plant (fruit and leaves) diseases from images as a classification problem. The goal is to develop a model/classifier that detects and assigns the corresponding disease class to image CFi=CF1, CF2, CF3,..., CF4 given a citrus disease image CFi. In this paper, we test a number of machine learning (ML) classifiers, as well as a deep learning model, the CNN. While existing machine learning classifiers use classical feature representation techniques, the proposed deep learning classifier employs a sufficient number of layers and an optimal set of parameters.In this paper, we formulate the identification of citrus plant (fruit and leaves) diseases from images as a classification problem.

        <p>The diagnosis of leaf and fruit disease has been a matter of study for many decades. Researchers have researched a variety of methods using machine learning and pattern detection to increase the recognition rate of disease diagnosis. These advanced technologies are used for a wide range of crops, including wheat [25], and rice [26.], maize [27], and corn [28], Different experiments on neural network approaches used for recognizing and classifying diseases from plant leave and fruit photos have been presented by Golhani et al. [29]. Wetterich et al. [30] used an SVM and a fluorescence imaging system to detect Citrus canker and Huanglongbing (HLB). The method's classification accuracy for identifying citrus canker and scab was 97.8%, while the method's accuracy for detecting HLB and zinc deficiency was 95%. K. Padmavathi et al. [31] adopted the Recursively Separated Weighted Histogram Equalization (RSHE) methodology to better distinguish Citrus diseases. In the second phase, the noise is eliminated from the citrus images. The suggested solutions enhance the quality of citrus images that can be used for further analysis. As discussed by Patel et al. [32], K-Means segmentation has been used to find the diseased region in pre-processed orange images. Both the colour, texture, and the shape of the affected region were taken from the training set and classified using the SVM classifier. GLCA models yielded a 67.74% accuracy. To identify citrus leaf diseases in 2020, Singh et al. [33] used the Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Multi-Layer Perceptron techniques. The kmeans clustering method was used to segment diseased areas in leaves, and color and texture characteristics were collected. To choose the most relevant characteristics, the ANOVA F-test is used. Finally, the pathogens were identified using the methods described above. A total of 236 diseased citrus leaves were included in the study. The use of a combination of color and texture characteristics improved precision. For color and texture characteristics, the precision of LDA, MLP, KNN, and SVM was 84.32 percent, 81.36 percent, 77.12 percent, and 80.93 percent, respectively. The approach suggested by [22] is based on the recognition of the citrus disease. The suggested procedures have been tested on infections in citrus fruits. Color and texture features are used to classify the proposed classifiers. The experimental findings show that the proposed strategy is much superior, and that it can support an accurate detection of citrus infection with minimal computational effort. Within the classification accuracy, there is a lot of room for improvement. Deep learning has become more popular in recent years, not only in image processing, image recognition, and categorization [17][18][19], but also in other areas like agriculture. Deep learning avoids the time-consuming feature extraction and threshold-based segmentation, making it a promising candidate for citrus disease classification [24]. Using a weakly thick linked convolutional network, Xing et al. [34] presented a recognition model for citrus disease and pests. They used a self-dataset for citrus and applied it to various CNN models. The NIN-16 model gained a test precision of 91.66 percent, which was higher than the SENet-16 model's 88.36 percent and 80.93 percent, respectively. Liu et al. [24] trained MobileNetV2 to classify six common citrus diseases and to diagnose them. Comparing the model correctness, model size and model validation speed with other network models, we can see that MobileNetV2 is good at classifying and recognizing citrus diseases. MobileNetV2 is a portable network with comparable accuracy and rapid validity to other network architectures. To diagnose diseases of the citrus leaf, Barman et al. [35] compares two distinct CNN designs, such as MobileNet and Self-Structured (SSCNN) classifiers. At epoch 10, the MobileNet CNN's greatest training accuracy was 98 percent, with 92 percent validation accuracy. However, the SSCNN's greatest training accuracy was 98 percent, with 99 percent validation accuracy at epoch 12. An intelligent technique convolutional neural networks is proposed by Khanramaki et al. [36] to detect following three citrus pests: citrus Leafminer, Sooty Mold, and Pulvinaria. A collection of 1774 citrus leaf photos was used to test the suggested approach. The accuracy of CNNs is measured using 10-fold cross validation in experimental study. Based on the results of the experiments, the suggested ensemble beat other competing CNN algorithms with an accuracy of 99.04 percent. Kukreja et al. [37] suggested a robust CNN algorithm for identifying and providing an effective approach for identifying apparent citrus fruit problems. The suggested method is compared to a dense model that does not employ data augmentation or preprocessing methods. The suggested model has an accuracy rate of 89.1%. The findings reveal that data augmentation and preprocessing strategies have yielded good results in estimating citrus crop damages. Partel et al. [38] created an autonomous system that monitors ACP in groves using machine vision and artificial intelligence. A tapping mechanism was used to catch insects from the tree's branches, and a board with a grid of cameras was used to capture images. Two convolutional neural networks were used to create software that efficiently detects and distinguishes psyllids from other insects and tree detritus. Detecting ACPs on a collection of 90 immature citrus plants yielded accuracy and recall of 80 percent and 95 percent, respectively.The diagnosis of leaf and fruit disease has been a matter of study for many decades.

        <p>Despite the fact that simple ML and DL techniques have been shown to be efficient and commonly used in crop disease prediction, most earlier works had difficulty increasing classification accuracy rates to some extent. Moreover, due to poor parameter and layer selection in the neural network model, there is some performance degradation. We use a different number of layers and parameter settings in the proposed CNN model for classifying citrus diseases in both fruit and leaf photographs. In addition, we test different CNN model variants and compare the results to the baseline studies.

        <p>Datasets are needed at all stages of image analysis study, from training to evaluating algorithms. This study used a total of 2293 images, taken from the citrus dataset [39] and PlantVillage dataset [40]. The benchmark repository, called PlantVillage, aims to provide researchers with information on plant health [40]. The infected images were divided into four groups, each representing a different disease of citrus fruits and leaves. Black spot, Canker, Scab, Greening, and Melanose were the diseases we studied in the datasets. Table 2 shows the dataset description. There are three parts of the dataset: (i) training data, (ii) test data, and (iii) validation data. On an Intel Core m3 7th Gen, 64-bit operating system, the proposed CNN model was introduced using the

        <p>Data validation can also be used to reduce overfitting and under fitting [33], which occurs when the training phase's efficiency is significant and performance degrades when tested with new data. As a result, while performing parameter tweaking, a 10% validation set is intended to prevent efficiency errors. We used automated dataset validation [34] for this purpose, which provides an impartial model evaluation and reduces overfitting [39].Data validation can also be used to reduce overfitting and under fitting [33], which occurs when the training phase's efficiency is significant and performance degrades when tested with new data.

        <p>To find an answer to "RQ1. How to apply the CNN model to effectively classify citrus fruit and leaf diseases?" Using various parameters, we tested different CNN classifiers for recognizing citrus fruit and leaf images into different diseases such as Black spot, canker, scab, greening, and Melanose. The proposed CNN model parameters for citrus disease recognition are shown in Table 3. We examined different settings and used different numbers of convolutionary layers: from 1 to 6. The number of filters ranges from 8 to 64, the number of epochs from 2 to 10, and various filter sizes, such as 3 x 3 and 2 x 2, are employed, as well as some fixed size parameters, such as max pool layers, image size, activation function, and batch size. Table 4 illustrates the layout of all system parameters for the varying CNN models (number of convolutional layers, Filter size, and number of filters). The number of convolutional layers in each CNN model varied depending on the number of epochs and filter size. All CNN models' structure settings are described in Table 4.

On the benchamark dataset, Patil et al. [7] achieved an accuracy of 89.46 percent. When tested on the same dataset, however, we got an accuracy of 55.58 percent.The purpose of micro-and macro-averages is to compute somewhat different stuff, hence their connotation changes.
