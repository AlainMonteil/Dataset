        <p>Introduction: Since a couple of years, low-field (LF) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers (40-100 MHz) have re-entered the market. They are used for various purposes including analyses of natural products. Similar to high-field instruments (300-1200 MHz), modern LF instruments can measure multiple nuclei and record two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra.Introduction: Since a couple of years, low-field (LF) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers (40-100 MHz) have re-entered the market.

        <p>For example, at that time the group of George Büchi was involved in the structure elucidation of terpenes, including patchoulol (Figure 1A). In a 1960 article, NMR was not yet used by them but in 1961 NMR first appeared through courtesy of another laboratory. 2 In 1964 their own laboratory had already purchased two Varian 60 MHz machines showing the big demand. 3 In the case of patchoulol, the application of NMR was mostly limited to methyl groups and olefinic protons of dehydration products but even this was highly useful. Only a few years later, NMR played a bigger and more varied role in the group of Koji Nakanishi. Even with NMR, solving the structures of the ginkgolides (Figure 1B) was a challenging puzzle. 4 Their spectra were more informative than those of patchoulol, which was also due to the fact that they had access to afor that timeadvanced 100 MHz Varian HR-100. Additionally, coupling constants and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) were used to determine stereochemistry and double resonance experiments were carried out to determine proton-proton connectivities. 5 This illustrates the rapid developments taking place, which were partially catalysed by the desire to solve complex natural products.For example, at that time the group of George Büchi was involved in the structure elucidation of terpenes, including patchoulol (Figure 1A).

        <p>The rest is history, Fourier-transform (FT)-NMR was introduced, which allowed the recording of carbon-13 ( 13 C)-NMR spectra, stronger and stronger superconducting magnets entered the market yielding much more resolution and sensitivity and finally all the 2D NMR techniques were gradually developed leading to the current situation.The rest is history, Fourier-transform (FT)-NMR was introduced, which allowed the recording of carbon-13 ( 13 C)-NMR spectra, stronger and stronger superconducting magnets entered the market yielding much more resolution and sensitivity and finally all the 2D NMR techniques were gradually developed leading to the current situation.</p>
        <p>However, modern NMR spectrometers are expensive both in terms of initial investment, consumables (liquid helium), maintenance (hardware) and operation (skilled personnel). Thus, they are out of reach for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), governmental quality control (QC) agencies, forensic laboratories and not at all universities students can get hands-on NMR training. This led to the introduction of benchtop NMR spectrometers with permanent magnets (42-100 MHz). They combine a small footprint, a 5-20× lower price, no consumables, almost zero maintenance and easy operation. The downside is a 5-20× lower resolution and a lower sensitivity. In contrast to low-field (LF)-NMR spectrometers of the 1960s, the new generation is capable of recording 2D spectra.However, modern NMR spectrometers are expensive both in terms of initial investment, consumables (liquid helium), maintenance (hardware) and operation (skilled personnel).

        <p>At first glance modern LF-NMR spectrometers seem to have little merit for natural product or phytochemical analysis as they appear less suitable for structure elucidation and the NMR spectra of even simple natural products exhibit second-order effects. However, natural product analysis is not synonymous with structure elucidation and since 2014 a number of articles have appeared on the application of LF-NMR in natural products analyses, e.g. for QC or forensic purposes. Four reviews on the topic of LF-NMR as a whole have been written by the group of Blümich. Three comprehensively reviewed fundamentals and developments concerning spectroscopy, relaxometry and imaging. [6][7][8] A fourth review focussed specifically on NMR spectroscopy. 9 Rudszuck et al. devoted a review to the QC of crude and edible oils by LF-NMR. 10 Finally Grootveld et al.At first glance modern LF-NMR spectrometers seem to have little merit for natural product or phytochemical analysis as they appear less suitable for structure elucidation and the NMR spectra of even simple natural products exhibit second-order effects.

        <p>This is an important field and the application of NMR in general to detect food fraud was recently separately reviewed. Some attention to LF-NMR was given and according to the authors benchtop NMR is potentially a breakthrough technology in food authentication. 21 Parker et al. in 2014 were the first to apply LF-NMR in phytochemical analysis. 22 They wished to detect adulteration of olive oil with hazelnut oil. This was highly challenging as these two vegetable oils possess an almost identical fatty acid (FA) composition, the only difference being the ~6% higher content of double unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) of hazelnut oil. Thus, the peak area ratio of olefinic peaks (~5.3 ppm, also including H2 of glycerol) versus H1 and H3 of glycerol (~4.2 ppm) was determined for both oils. This ratio was 1.70 and 1.52 for hazelnut and olive oil, respectively, but due to natural variation the most extreme values were almost identical. The final result was that 13% (w/w) hazelnut adulteration could be detected with 95% confidence. Additionally, they used a chemometric approach using the shape of the entire spectrum. This allowed for the detection of 11% adulteration with 95% confidence. Thus, the method is not fool-proof, false negatives and especially false positives will occur occasionally. Compared to an FT-IR method, the 60 MHz NMR method performed better. 22 The earlier-mentioned study was summarised in a subsequent article by this group together with new results. 23 Vegetable oil samples were diluted 1:1 with chloroform (CHCl 3 ) and measured at 60 MHz.This is an important field and the application of NMR in general to detect food fraud was recently separately reviewed.

        <p>of the LF-NMR data, 10 different vegetable oils could be clearly distinguished. Not surprisingly, as the analytes (TAGs) are the same, the methodology could also distinguish between different types of meats and detect adulteration of sunflower oil with lard. 23 The meat application was also separately published. 24 Riegel investigated adulteration of olive oil with soybean oil. 25 To this purpose, solutions in CDCl 3 of olive oils spiked with 5-60% of soybean oil were measured at 60 MHz. As soybean oil has a much higher content of PUFAs, plotting the percentage of bis-allylic protons against the soybean oil percentage gave a straight line. By means of this curve the extent of adulteration could be determined. Possible pitfalls are that beforehand it is not always known which vegetable oil is used for adulteration and the natural variation in FA composition of both olive and soybean oil will influence the calibration curve.of the LF-NMR data, 10 different vegetable oils could be clearly distinguished.

        <p>The adulteration of edible oils was further investigated by the group of Giraudeau. 26,27 They convincingly showed that 2D NMR at 43 MHz, can provide more reliable information regarding vegetable oils than one-dimensional (1D) NMR at 43 or 60 MHz (Figure 2). To allow a faster recording of correlated spectroscopy (COSY) spectra, they added a gradient coil along the B 0 -axis. In combination with a homemade pulse sequence, high quality COSY spectra could be obtained with only 72 scans in 2.4 min. However, to reduce integration errors, each sample was measured five times. Sample preparation was simple: mixing roughly equal volumes of non-deuterated chloroform and oil. Due to the two dimensions, signals specific for UFAs and PUFAs as well as H1/H3 and H2 of glycerol (GLY) could be separately integrated (Figure 2D). By looking at both the ratios PUFA/UFA and GLY/UFA, a fair separation of five different vegetable oils was possible although the number of samples was relatively small. 27 The distinction between olive and hazelnut oils remained difficult. In a follow-up article, they applied different chemometric methods on the 1D and ultrafast 2D spectra. The PCA using 2D data was able to separate the six investigated oils. The adulteration of olive oil with hazelnut oil could be detected better than by 1D NMR although below 20% adulteration users might still encounter false negatives and positives. 26 This article by Gouilleux and others by him cited in this review were also published as part of his PhD thesis. 28 A LF-NMR method for adulteration detection of Perilla frutescens edible oil with 30 times cheaper soybean oil was developed. 29 Samples (100 μL, in triplicate) were dissolved in 500 μL of CDCl 32 However, this proved difficult asespecially in the case of RROthe TAG composition is highly similar leading to LF-NMR spectra, which are difficult to distinguish by a human observer.The adulteration of edible oils was further investigated by the group of Giraudeau. 26,27 They convincingly showed that 2D NMR at 43 MHz, can provide more reliable information regarding vegetable oils than one-dimensional (1D) NMR at 43 or 60 MHz (Figure 2).

        <p>Chemometric data treatment gave better results for RSO. The LODs (limits of detection) were 24% and 8% admixture of RSO at 60 and 400 MHz, respectively. NMR was less suitable for detecting adulteration with RRO. 32 A remarkable case of an inadvertent process error (or willful adulteration) in the production of two synthetic peptides was reported by Choules et al. 33 Based on their QC measurements by means of LC-UV, the manufacturer claimed the peptides to be 98.44% and 98.34% pure. However, several large, unexplainable peaks were discovered by the customer in both NMR spectra. 800 MHz qualitative and quantitative NMR showed the additional compound to be mannitol and the true peptide purities to be 80.5% and 56.9%. Also 60 MHz The structure of strychnine could be confirmed by interpreting several 1D ( 1 H and 13 C, incl. 3× DEPT) and 2D (COSY, HETCOR, HSQC, HMBC, J-resolved) NMR spectra at 43 MHz (total recording time 90 h). 35 For comparison, 400 MHz spectra were recorded. In spite of the significant signal overlap and second-order effects, it proved possible to assign all protons and carbons as well as many coupling constants. Still it is a misconception to think that the full structure of strychnine including stereochemistry at its six chiral centres could have been elucidated without prior knowledge of the structure with only 43 MHz spectra. Apart from the free base, also two salts of strychnine (hemisulphate and hydrochloride) were measured in three solvents. Several protons and carbons gave different chemical shifts depending on the counter ion. This could prove useful for forensic purposes. 35 Smokable herbal mixtures sold as "incense" may contain one or more synthetic cannabinoids. LF-NMR has been applied as a qualitative pre-screening method to rapidly identify nine cannabinoids. 36 Reference spectra were recorded. Thus, 40 mg of a herbal mixture was extracted during 2 × 5 min with 1 mL of CDCl 3 containing 0.5 mM dimethyl maleate and 600 μL of supernatant was then measured in 8 min. Each cannabinoid gave specific signals and if one of them was present in a herbal mixture it could be identified. However, if more compounds are present, the identification becomes cumbersome due to many matrix compounds, spectral overlap and lower concentrations. Confirmation and quantitation after initial screening by LF-NMR is possible by HF-NMR and MS. 36 Pseudoephedrine and ephedrine can be used as starting materials for methamphetamine ("meth") synthesis. 37 LF-NMR spectra The degradation of compounds present in fingerprints (squalene, oleic acid, nonanoic acid) as a function of light exposure was studied to determine the age of human fingerprints. 40 Irradiated pure compounds were dissolved in CDCl 3 and investigated by 60 and 400 MHz NMR.

        <p>To deal with more and more seized samples containing psychoactive substances, LF-NMR (60 MHz) was employed to screen samples. 41 A maximum of 10 mg of sample was dissolved in 1 mL of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d 6 ). Subsequent NMR measurement and chemometric analysis took 5 min. The spectra were subdivided in two regions: one identifying the class (0.46-1.54 ppm) and one identifying the substance ("fingerprint-region", 3.90-12.50 ppm). DMSO was used as internal standard. The spectra were compared with a library of 302 spectra. The substances were of natural (cocaine, caffeine, cannabis, sugars) and synthetic origin. A Pearson's correlation was calculated for the match between a sample and library spectrum (1.000 = perfect match). Validation took place and resulted in class being correct &gt; 99% and compound &gt; 95% correct. For mixtures, these percentages dropped but still for 65% of the samples both compounds were correctly identified. Subsequently 432 seized samples were analysed by both LF-NMR and GC-MS. In 93% of the cases the results matched and in another 6% there was a partial match with one component of a binary mixture identified. Only for 1% of the samples contradictory results were obtained. Interestingly, the correct class identification of an unknown drug, eventually led to its identification. 41 Keizers et al. reported on qualitative and quantitative investigations of falsified medicines and illegal drugs by LF-NMR. 42 The emphasis was on synthetic medicines like aspirin and diclofenac and the only natural products investigated were cocaine, caffeine and 4-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Qualitative identification occurred through chemometrics in combination with a spectral database. For quantitation of illegal medicines, internal standardisation was used and validation was by LC-MS. GHB and cocaine in street drugs could be identified by LF-NMR.To deal with more and more seized samples containing psychoactive substances, LF-NMR (60 MHz) was employed to screen samples. 41 A maximum of 10 mg of sample was dissolved in 1 mL of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d 6 ).

For mixtures, these percentages dropped but still for 65% of the samples both compounds were correctly identified. Subsequently 432 seized samples were analysed by both LF-NMR and GC-MS. In 93% of the cases the results matched and in another 6% there was a partial match with one component of a binary mixture identified. Only for 1% of the samples contradictory results were obtained. Interestingly, the correct class identification of an unknown drug, eventually led to its identification. 41 Keizers et al. reported on qualitative and quantitative investigations of falsified medicines and illegal drugs by LF-NMR. 42 The emphasis was on synthetic medicines like aspirin and diclofenac and the only natural products investigated were cocaine, caffeine and 4-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Qualitative identification occurred through chemometrics in combination with a spectral database. For quantitation of illegal medicines, internal standardisation was used and validation was by LC-MS. GHB and cocaine in street drugs could be identified by LF-NMR.</p>
        <p>LF-NMR was used to distinguish more expensive arabica from cheaper robusta coffees. 43 Only robusta coffee contains 16-Omethyl-cafestol (16-OMC). This compound exhibits a 3H singlet at 3.16 ppm due to its methyl ether moiety and no other coffee constituents show resonances in this region. Thus, it could serve as an indicator for the inadvertent or deliberate occurrence of robusta in arabica coffees. The procedure was simple: extraction of 1 g of ground coffee with 3.0 mL of CDCl 3 in 5 min with agitation followed by direct filtration through cotton into an NMR tube. The 16-OMC content was given relative to the glyceride region (3.9-4.6 ppm) to correct for a variable extraction efficiency. As the 16-OMC content of robusta varies, a precise detection limit could not be given but the adulteration limit was estimated to lie between 10 and 20%. A survey of 27 "100% arabica" coffees in the UK revealed no fraud. 43 In a follow-up article, the sensitivity of the method mentioned earlier was increased by extracting 10 g of coffee with 30 mL of CHCl 3 , filtration, evaporation, re-dissolving in 800 μL of CDCl 3 and filtration directly into an NMR tube. 44 This gave a much better signal/noise (S/N) ratio for the 16-OMC peak. Due to the higher sensitivity, it was discovered that arabica beans also contain small amounts of 16-OMC, on average 1.5% of the content of robusta coffee. However, arabica coffee from some marginal coffee-growing areas contained significantly higher concentrations of 16-OMC, potentially increasing the risk of false positives. The authors claim that with the adapted methodology the occurrence of 2% robusta in arabica will be detected in 90% of the cases, so the risk of false negatives is low. Sixty arabica coffees were screened and eight samples were marked as suspicious with the most adulterated sample containing ~33% of robusta. 44 Hop (Humulus lupulus) is an important beer ingredient. Its bitter acids import the specific beer flavour. Killeen et al. used various techniques, including 400 MHz NMR, to quantify bitter acids in hops. 45 Lupulin glands (~20 mg) were sonicated with 800 μL of CDCl sugars in fruit juices. 47 They did not make use of internal standards or integration values. First, they quantum mechanically calculated spectra of the individual components at 60 MHz based on all known chemical shifts and coupling constants. Then, using the simulated spectra of all components, software calculated the mole fractions for which the combined spectrum gave the best fit with the real-life spectrum of the food under investigation. The advantage of this approach is that independent of the field strength of the used instrument, the combined spectrum can be predicted. A disadvantage is that the NMR data of any component to be measured must first be completely unravelled at high field. The same approach was followed by Duffy et al. in their differentiation of fentanyl analogues by LF-NMR. 48 and by Choules et al. for QC of fine chemicals. 33 An example is given inLF-NMR was used to distinguish more expensive arabica from cheaper robusta coffees. 43 Only robusta coffee contains 16-Omethyl-cafestol (16-OMC).

        <p>From the earlier cited articles, it is obvious that there are many opportunities for modern LF-NMR for the purpose of natural products analysis. QC uses have until now focussed primarily on TAG profiles of vegetable oils.
