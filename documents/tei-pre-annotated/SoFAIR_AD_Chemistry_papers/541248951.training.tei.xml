        <p>Supramolecular chemistry is a comparatively young field that to date has mainly been focused on building a foundation of fundamental understanding. With much progress in this area, researchers are seeking to apply this knowledge to the development of commercially viable products. In this review we seek to outline historical and recent developments within the field of supramolecular chemistry that have made the transition from laboratory to market, and to bring to light those technologies that we believe have commercial potential. In doing so we hope we may illuminate pathways to market for research currently being conducted.Supramolecular chemistry is a comparatively young field that to date has mainly been focused on building a foundation of fundamental understanding.

        <p>The term supramolecular chemistry was first coined by Jean-Marie Lehn in the 1970s. 1 Although this was first use of the term, the study of non-covalent molecular complexation, a field that we now identify as being part of supramolecular chemistry, was already under investigation within the scope of other scientific fields such as enzymology, organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry. [2][3][4] Today, supramolecular chemistry broadly encompasses the study of all types of intermolecular non-covalent bond formation in designed molecular systems, and also incorporates dynamic covalent chemistry. [5][6][7] The body of work undertaken in this field since the late 1960s has twice resulted in the award of the Nobel prize in Chemistry, first in 1987 and again in 2016, for the development of host-guest binding molecules 8 and molecular machines respectively. 9 As a rapidly growing scientific field of study, supramolecular chemistry is now expanding beyond the chemical space, finding applications at the interfaces with many other disciplines, and offering novel solutions to age old problems in biology, physics, engineering and pharmacy. 10 This has caused the field of supramolecular chemistry to move towards commercial, real world applications whilst fundamental studies still continue. As a result industry has now begun to embrace this field of chemistry, incorporating aspects of these next generation technologies into a variety of everyday commercial, marketable products. 7,[11][12][13] Examples of applied supramolecular innovation include the development of medical diagnostic sensors, enabled through advances in selective host-guest complex formation; 7,14 maintenance free materials, created through incorporation of reversible non-covalent moieties within material constructs; 15,16 and ion extraction realised through the development of molecular encapsulation technologies. 17,18 Herein, we update and expand on a previous review by Kolesnichnko and Anslyn, 19 to discuss the application of supramolecular chemistry in the real world.The term supramolecular chemistry was first coined by Jean-Marie Lehn in the 1970s. 1 Although this was first use of the term, the study of non-covalent molecular complexation, a field that we now identify as being part of supramolecular chemistry, was already under investigation within the scope of other scientific fields such as enzymology, organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry.

For example, p-tert-butylcalix[n]arene where n = 4 or 6 could be reacted with ethyl bromoacetate in dry acetone in the presence of potassium carbonate as base by refluxing for several days to afford the calix [4]arene tetra-ester 1 or calix [6]arene hexa-ester 2 respectively. 20 These compounds have high affinities for group 1 metal cations with compound 1 showing Na + selectivity over other group 1 metal cations whilst compound 2 is selective for larger metal cations. McKervey and co-inventors found that these types of ionophoric calixarenes could be used in super glue as accelerators by sequestering group 1 metal cations. For example, the addition of 0.1% compound 2 to a commercially available cyanoacrylate-based adhesive reduced fixture time from between 20 to 25 minutes to between 3 and 5 minutes, allowing porous surfaces to be effectively bonded together before the glue had diffused away (Fig. 1). 21 Another class of supermolecular host used as components of household products are the cyclodextrins (CDs), which are cyclic oligosaccharides that consist of glucose monomers linked by a-1,4-glycosidic bonds. 22 These compounds were first isolated by Antoine Villiers in 1891 and are produced from starch by an enzymatic degradation process. 22,23 Another household use of supramolecular chemistry is in the product Febreze which is manufactured by Procter and Gamble. Febreze is a spray that eliminates household odours and can be used on fabrics. 11 The spray contains hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) (3), a cyclodextrin derivative with increased solubility. In this case 3 is reputed to complex odour molecules within the cavity of the macrocycle and so suppresses odours. HPBCD as a mixture of compounds with various degrees and patterns of hydroxypropylation and along with other cyclodextrin derivatives has been used as an excipient to improve the water solubility and bioavailability of drugs. 24with Schwing-Weill and co-workers) a number of ionophoric calix [n]arenes formed by appending additional groups to the lower-rim.

        <p>The scalable synthesis of the parent a, b and g-CDs also makes this scaffold a commercially attractive prospect with a comparatively low price point and ease of purification. The 30 year development in CD related technologies has led to wide applications in pharmaceuticals, drug delivery systems, cosmetics, and the food and chemical industries. 26,[28][29][30] Amongst notable applications of CDs are their use in overcoming the limitations of certain pharmaceutical compounds by forming an inclusion complex, enhancing the drug solubility and stability and improving drug permeation and bioavailability. 22,26 These inclusion complexes enhance the physicochemical characteristics of the drugs without changing their intrinsic properties. However, the limitations of CDs include the small cavity size of a-CD, the low water solubility of b-CD and low production yields of g-CD. 27 Interestingly, a topical drug delivery system (eye drops) based on dexamethasone 7 (Fig. 3(d)) and g-CD nanoparticles has been developed by Oculis s . 31 This non-invasive system contains 1.5% dexamethasone and g-CD nanoparticles (OSC-01) and showed a promising reduction of the central macular thickness (CMT) and an increase in visual acuity in diabetic macular oedema (DMO) patients. 32 In vivo studies in humans showed that OCS-01 achieved a 10 times higher concentration of dexamethasone in the eye tissue after 4 h of application, when compared to Maxidex s (0.1% dexamethasone only eye drops). This was mainly due to the higher ocular absorption and a longer retention of the g-CD-drug nanoparticles at the site of action. 33 OCS-01 completed phase-2 clinical trials (DX-216) for treating inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. 34 Of the 144 randomized patients who started this study, 131 completed the trial. Results from DX-211 showed the efficacy of OSC-01 in patients with DME when compared to the vehicle. OCS-01 showed no significant or unexpected ocular adverse effects. 34 The OCS-01 eye drops were also investigated for their antiinflammatory effect in 10 human eyes for six patients (five female) complaining of different ocular inflammatory diseases, including anterior scleritis, posterior scleritis, unidentified uveitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease with papillitis and cystoid macular oedema. 35 All treated eyes responded to OCS-01 with a rapid resolution of congestion with no patients experiencing impaired visual acuity after the treatment started. 35 Fig. 4 shows both eyes of a 45-year-old man with anterior scleritis before (Fig. 4(a and b)) and after 4 weeks treatment with OCS-01 (Fig. 4(c andd)). After treatment, ocular congestion almost disappeared, and the pain was reduced significantly and did not recur. 35 Poor control of blood glucose levels is implicated with increased morbidity and mortality, especially in hospital intensive care unit (ICU) patients. 36,37 Continuous glucose monitoring over a 24 h period is useful when seeking to acquire control of blood sugar and to avoid hypo-and hyper-glycaemia, especially in diabetic patients. 38,39 Great efforts have been made in the development of D-glucose sensors based on supramolecular interactions between boronic acid motifs and sugars via hydrogen bonding and ester formation. [40][41][42][43][44] Boronic acids are a reliable group for sugar sensing and have showed a high affinity for vicinal diols, catechols and compounds appended with a-hydroxycarboxylate when incorporated into different scaffolds. 44 However phenylboronic acid shows significant binding to carbohydrates only above physiological pH, indicating its limited application. 41,45 The inclusion of an a-aminomethyl group in the ortho-position of the boronic acid was found to tune the selectivity and improve the binding affinity at neutral pH. [46][47][48][49] Interestingly, mono or simple boronic acids have been found to bind to saccharides in the order D-fructose 4 D-galactose 4 D-mannose 4 D-glucose. [50][51][52] Changing the binding site to a diboronic acid motif and expanding the structure into more complex systems, capable of binding at multiple sites, perturbed the D-glucose selectivity. 51 Finally, incorporating fluorophores such as pyrene and anthracene into the a-aminomethylphenylboronic acid scaffold has yielded hosts that have been used for sensing and cellular imaging. 44,52 As a result of these innovations, two companies, namely Eversense (by Senseonics) and Glysure Ltd, have been founded by Tony James and his collaborators, exploiting the application of fluorescent o-aminomethylphenylboronic acids, (8) (Fig. 5). [53][54][55] The Glysure system (9, Fig. 6 detection chemistry are based on the covalent interaction between the diboronic acids motifs and D-glucose and the formation of cis-1,2-diols or 1,3-diols resulting in the formation of either a five or six membered ring system. 54 The acidity of the boron atoms increases when D-glucose binds to the boronic acid groups leading to the formation of weak boron-nitrogen (B^N) bonds. The B^N interaction disrupts electron transfer from the tertiary amines to covalently tethered fluorophores thus leading to fluorescence emission. 54 The resulting fluorescence is proportional and quantitative to the D-glucose concentration. Both systems demonstrated a valid and accurate continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels, receiving CE Mark approval in 2015 (Glysure) (Fig. 6(a)) and 2017 (Eversense) (Fig. 6(b)). The Eversense system is derived from the unprecedentedly selective glucose chemosensor (10) developed by James, Sandanayake and Shinkai in 1994, while Glysure system (9) is based on the fluorescent sensor discovered by Arimori, Frimat and James in 2001 as part of a collaboration with Beckman Coulter. [51][52][53]56,57 Blood glucose monitoring devices incorporating the Glysure and Eversense systems are illustrated in Fig. 7. The Glysure system shown in Fig. 6(a) is immobilized within a hydrogel, while the Eversense system (Fig. 6(b)) is immobilized in a poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (pHEMA) hydrogel which is copolymerized with a fluorescent indicator. 54 The Glysure sensor device is composed of the immobilized fluorescent glucose indicator cell, (Fig. 7(a)). 54 The immobilized hydrogel fills the optical fibre which is surrounded by a dialysis membrane, and consequently fills the optical cell. The microporous membrane, with a pore diameter B0.1 mM, prevents blood cells from entering the sensor (Fig. 7(a)). 54 The subcutaneous Eversense sensor monitors glucose concentration in interstitial fluids (Fig. 7(b)). 58 This sensor has a diameter of 3.3 mm and a length of 15 mm, which is then enclosed in a rigid and biocompatible polymer capsule (Fig. 7(b)). 58 The glucose detection hydrogel is copolymerized onto the capsule surface, while a light emitting diode (LED) provides the excitation source for the fluorescent gel. Two filtered photodiodes measure the fluorescence intensity, while the antenna is responsible for communication with the transmitter.The scalable synthesis of the parent a, b and g-CDs also makes this scaffold a commercially attractive prospect with a comparatively low price point and ease of purification.

        <p>An externally worn device communicates with the inserted sensor and receives the recorded information. The measurements can also be displayed on a secondary output wirelessly via Bluetootht and can be downloaded through a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port (Fig. 7(b)). 53 Cucurbiturils (CB) are synthetic barrel-shaped macrocycles obtained from the condensation of formaldehyde and glycolurils. 59,60 Although first synthesized more than 100 years ago, cucurbit [6]uril (CB [6]), 11, shown in Fig. 8, was only characterized in the 1980s. 59 Over the last two decades, other members of the CB family have been synthesized and purified, including CB [5], CB [7], CB[8], and CB [10] containing 5, 7, 8, or 10 glycoluril subunits, respectively. 60,61 CBs display unique physical, chemical and biological properties, primarily owing to their intrinsic ability to undergo complexation with diverse chemical species resulting in the formation of dynamic hostguest complexes. Recently, CBs have gained interest within an increasingly diverse range of applications including nanotechnology, molecular recognition, catalysis, drug delivery, analytical and environmental chemistry and chemical biology. [60][61][62][63][64] For example, CB [7] typically binds one guest molecule and can be crosslinked with a variety of motifs, such as adamantane and gold nanoparticles, to prepare supramolecular hydrogels, functional surfaces and nanoparticles with commercial applications. 65,66 A recent study in this area has employed CB [7] as a noncovalent linker motif to enhance the interaction between catechol functionalized chitosan (CAT-CS) and superparamagnetic g-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles. 67 Fig. 9 shows the synthesis of a magnetic hydrogel nanocomposite composed of CB [7] linked to superparamagnetic g-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles, bound to the CAT-CS polymer backbone. Here the polysaccharide chitosan is post-functionalized with the catechol motif yielding CAT-CS, which was is then complexed with CB [7] via inclusion of the catechol side chains in the cavities of the CB [7] macrocycles. The carbonyl groups of the CB [7] then bind with the g-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles through electrostatic interactions, resulting in the formation of a noncovalent network (Fig. 9). The hybrid supramolecular hydrogel (HSH) displays heat generation through vibrational movement upon exposure to an alternating magnetic field. This offers a promising stimuli-responsive thermochemotherapy, which has been investigated for biological activity both in vitro and in vivo. 67 Here, in vitro cellular thermal studies conducted using the apoptosis detection kit annexin V-FITC/PI in HeLa cells, showed that when the HSH was exposed to an alternating magnetic field for 12 minutes, cell apoptosis was induced through an increase in temperature. 67 Additionally, comparative in vivo intravital fluorescence imaging and infrared thermography studies were performed in tumour-bearing nude mice. In this study, mice were injected with indocyanine greenloaded HSH and, it was shown that in the presence of alternating magnetic pulses tumour size decreased. These effects were shown to be dependent on exposure time, with longer exposures leading to a greater reduction in tumour size (Fig. 10(a-c)). This indicates that the intermittent exposure to magnetic pulses was the major contributing factor to both the therapeutic outcomes and overall mouse fitness, as indicated by comparative difference in mouse body weight. Finally, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and the immunohistochemical examination of biomarkers for cell proliferation and apoptosis were also performed (Fig. 10(d)). These results showed that in this instance thermoand chemotherapies were acting synergistically, while the immunohistochemical examinations suggested that the intermittent magnetic irradiation provided an efficient way to suppress tumour growth in vivo. 67An externally worn device communicates with the inserted sensor and receives the recorded information.

        <p>Since the pioneering work of Czarnick and de Silva reported in the 1980's and early 1990's, relating to the development of molecular chemosensors, [68][69][70][71][72][73][74] numerous papers have appeared in the literature on the subject. Quite surprisingly, only a few systems have found application in real life so far. The company Optimedical Inc. commercialised a medical diagnostic analyzer (OPTI LION s ) based on three molecular fluorescent chemosensors 12-14, (Fig. 11), selective for Na + , K + , and Ca 2+ , respectively, designed by de Silva and collaborators. This device can quantify the concentrations of electrolytes contained within blood serum via fluorescence measurements. This system is currently marketed for use within hospital critical care units, ambulances, and even in veterinary settings. 75,76 Additionally, a spin-out company from the University of Bristol, UK, Zylo, founded by Anthony Davis and focused on the development of biomimetic glucose binding molecules was acquired by the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk in 2018. Davis and co-workers are still working in the field, in a new company named Carbometics, and have recently described a highly selective synthetic receptor able to bind glucose in water with a remarkable K a = 18 000 M À1 , comparable with natural receptor systems. 77 This lectin mimic features a highly polar hexaurea core that form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups within glucose, and a triethylmesitylene moieties that form hydrophobic/CH-p interactions with the CH groups, while the high solubility in water is guaranteed by three peripheral nonacarboxylate groups. This rational design towards binding saccharides with equatorial all equatorial hydroxyls enables this lectin mimic to bind glucose over mannose, a related sugar differing by only a single axial hydroxyl group, with a 100 fold increased binding affinity (K a = 18 600 and 140 M À1 respectively). The system also showed high thermal stability and no toxicity towards HeLa cells. This specificity towards glucose in biological mixtures is crucial in the development technologies to help control diabetes.Since the pioneering work of Czarnick and de Silva reported in the 1980's and early 1990's, relating to the development of molecular chemosensors, [68][69][70][71][72][73][74] numerous papers have appeared in the literature on the subject.

These materials are able to change colour/fluorescence when exposed to vapours of 101 Since this time two main classes of vapochromic materials have been developed. The first based on coordination complexes or organometallic compounds and the second on organic compounds, as recently reviewed by Huang and co-workers. 102 Recent research from this group has led to the development of vapochromic materials, based on nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs) formed from pillar[n]arenes. 103 A transformation of the NACs structure occurs upon exposure to vapours of certain guest molecules, resulting in the generation of intrinsic or extrinsic porosity. With the guest molecules removed the NAC structure returns to a nonporous state. For example, NACs of pillar [4]-arene [1]quinone work particularly well in detecting vapours of aliphatic aldehydes of different chain lengths. 104 Adsorption of these aldehydes leads to a colour change of this NAC. Crystal structure analysis reveals this colour change is due to alteration of the p-p stacking interactions between the benzoquinone and the 1,4-diethoxybenzene units of the pillar [4]-arene [1]quinone scaffold. 105 Additionally, the fluorescence emission properties of an anthracene appended pillar [5]-arene ( 21) NAC were also found to alter upon exposure to vapours of short chain alkyl ketones such as 2-butanone, 2-pentanone, and 2-hexanone (Fig. 17). 106 Within this material, observed fluorescence is attributed to the formation of an excimer between two adjacent anthracene moieties. On adsorption of an appropriate short chain ketone the excimer is disrupted and the fluorescence of the monomeric anthracene only is observed. Further to the use of NACs as vapochromic receptors, their application in chemical purification is outlined later in this review.Vapochromic materials are an interesting class of chemosensors with potential environmental applications.

        <p>Chemical warfare agents (CWAs) such as organophosphorus (OP) species and sulfur mustards (HD) are volatile and highly toxic molecules and potentially lethal, uncontrollable weapons when deployed. 107 Due to the continued use of these agents in conflict situations and attacks on civilians, there is continued research into methods to remediate these compounds after release and to sense their presence. Such technology would also be of military value to mitigate the risks of producing and storing these species. As a result, significant effort has been put in over recent years to develop sensors able to recognize phosphorous-containing nerve agents. Gale and co-workers have described several examples of ureas/thioureas [108][109][110] or polyureas able to recognize the chemical warfare agent soman (GD) and other organophosphorous species. The recognition event relates to the formation of H-bond interactions between the organophosphonate guests and the urea/thiourea hosts. Some of the proposed systems were able to form organogels and in the presence of the organophosphorous species a disruption of the material could be observed as a sensory output. [111][112][113][114][115] The first example of fluorescent chemosensors for phosphonate recognition, able to give a turn-on fluorescent response in the presence of hydrolysis products of the nerve gas sarin, isopropyl methylphosphonate (IMP), and methylphosphonate (MP) was reported by Anzenbacher and co-workers. 116 Eight fluorescent tripodal sensors with a 1,3,5-triethylbenzene core were dissolved in DMSO and found to give a finger printed response for IMP and MP over other common anions, as demonstrated by linear discrimination analysis (LDA). A chromogenic probe based on BODIPY (22) was developed in Martı ´nez-Ma ´n ˜ez group for the detection of DFP (a sarin and soman mimic) and DCNP (a tabun mimic). 117 As shown in Fig. 18 this system has three reactive sites; i.e. (i) a nucleophilic phenol group able to undergo phosphorylation with nerve gases, (ii) a carbonyl group as a reactive site for cyanide; and (iii) a triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) protecting group that is known to react with fluoride. The colour change in response to fluoride or cyanide is indicative of the presence of DFP or DCNP respectively. Dramatic and differing colour changes were observed in MeCN upon addition of one equivalent of DFP and DCNP, showing the ability of this system to detect and differentiate these CWA mimics.Chemical warfare agents (CWAs) such as organophosphorus (OP) species and sulfur mustards (HD) are volatile and highly toxic molecules and potentially lethal, uncontrollable weapons when deployed. 107 Due to the continued use of these agents in conflict situations and attacks on civilians, there is continued research into methods to remediate these compounds after release and to sense their presence.

To avoid the use of excess base or other reagents, 107 catalysis underpinned by molecular recognition strategies has been investigated as a route to promote the hydrolysis of bound OPs to safe by-products. However, investigating strategies to remediate or sense live CWAs is extremely challenging due to the acute toxicity of these species. While significant progress has been made using simulants of lower toxicity and greater ease of handling, their behaviour invariably differs from live agents. 107 Here we will discuss recent reports that show progress in the remediation of live CWAs which demonstrate the potential for application in the field.Although OP species eventually degrade via hydrolysis, this is a slow process at neutral pH.

        <p>The application of supramolecular chemistry towards this purpose has focussed on strategies to immobilise the agent and subsequently trigger its breakdown, with recent progress made in systems which can achieve both of these elements. While organogels formed from gelators that can act as destructive agents to trigger the decomposition of the CWA are known, it is also possible to immobilise reactive decontaminants within an organogel matrix to form a multicomponent material from simple precursors. 114,118 In recent work funded by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratories (Dstl), Holder, Blight and co-workers examined the immobilisation of a catalytic metal organic framework (MOF) inside a polymer sponge network. 119 This work combined the previously reported ability of styrenic poly high internal phase emulsions (pHIPEs) to swell and trap a range of OP and mustard series nerve agents 120 with the known propensity of zirconium MOFs to function as heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrolysis of OPs. 121 The authors prepared a composite material consisting of a styrene or vinyl based pHIPEs and zirconium MOF-808 at a loading of 25 wt% relative to the monomer weight. MOF-808 was chosen due to its activity in catalysing OP hydrolysis, and because the linker is commercially available making this MOF suitable for cost-effective scale-up. Phosphorus NMR studies using the CWA simulant dimethyl p-nitrophenylphosphate (DMNP) indicated that OP hydrolysis was significantly accelerated in the presence of the composite material in 0.45 M NEM buffer and THF/H 2 O/D 2 O (2 : 1 : 1), and performed better than experiments in which the catalytic MOF was added as a powder, due to the better dispersion of the catalyst. Minimal hydrolysis was observed in the absence of the MOF. Following on from this, hydrolysis studies using the live agent VX demonstrated that the composite materials could trigger hydrolysis in THF/water solution, with half-lives of 1 hour. Furthermore, neat VX could also be degraded in the absence of any solvent; with a total MOF-808 catalyst loading of 0.18% relative to VX, near full hydrolysis was observed after 2 weeks under ambient humidity. Over the same period without catalysis, the hydrolysis of VX would be expected to reach 50% completion only. The authors noted that potentially 4.5 kg of the composite would be able to absorb, immobilise and degrade the entire contents of a standard barrel (208 L) of VX.The application of supramolecular chemistry towards this purpose has focussed on strategies to immobilise the agent and subsequently trigger its breakdown, with recent progress made in systems which can achieve both of these elements.

        <p>Notable progress in supramolecular approaches to gold extraction has been made based on the work of Stoddart et al., who first reported the capacity of a-cyclodextrin to recognise and isolate gold in the form of alkali metal haloaurate salts (produced from gold bearing raw materials through etching followed by neutralisation) in 2013. 132 The underlying principle of this work is the spontaneous precipitation of an extended {[K(OH 2 ) 6 ][AuBr 4 ]C(a-cyclodextrin) 2 } n chain superstructure from water. Metallic gold can then be isolated from the aÁBr precipitate by reduction with sodium metabisulfite (Na 2 S 2 O 5 ), while the a-cyclodextrin can be recovered for re-use by recrystallisation. This extraction strategy inspired the establishment of Cycladex in 2014, 133 a company whose mission is to reduce operating costs and toxic waste byproducts in commercial precious metal extraction. As a result of these efforts a patented method by which precious metals can be recovered has been developed, 134 and the company has reportedly demonstrated this in a pilot plant at the ton level. 135 The success of Cycladex has also inspired studies into gold precipitation using other macrocyclic hosts. Tao et al. Interestingly, CB [7] was observed to form [Au(OH 2 ) 4 ] 3+ C CB [7] inclusion complexes, leading Tao et al. to suggest that CB [7] has the most suitable cavity dimensions to encapsulate this hydrated cation. Additionally, Tao observed that CB [6] exhibited better performance in gold extraction experiments than the other CB[n] homologues, while an optimised protocol from Stoddart 138 achieved an impressive gold recovery efficiency of 99.2% based on the co-precipitation of CB [6] and HAuCl 4 . This extraction efficiency is greater than the 78% achieved with a-cyclodextrin. 139 The extraction was selective for gold over Cu, Zn and Ag (Stoddart) and Cu, Cd, Ni, and Zn (Tao). Both groups observed that reduction with hydrazine hydrate could yield gold metal and allow recovery of the macrocycle for re-use.Notable progress in supramolecular approaches to gold extraction has been made based on the work of Stoddart et al., who first reported the capacity of a-cyclodextrin to recognise and isolate gold in the form of alkali metal haloaurate salts (produced from gold bearing raw materials through etching followed by neutralisation) in 2013. 132 The underlying principle of this work is the spontaneous precipitation of an extended {[K(OH 2 ) 6 ][AuBr 4 ]C(a-cyclodextrin) 2 } n chain superstructure from water.

        <p>Love et al. have focussed on strategies to isolate gold from WEEE waste through solvent extraction.

        <p>involving 23 indicated that phase transfer occurred through the assembly of clusters of [AuCl 4 ] À with one protonated and one neutral amide, yielding overall charge neutral structures stabilised by a combination of hydrogen bonding and columbic attraction (Fig. 21(b)). 140 The overall charge neutrality of the clusters means that ion pairing is not required for transport into the organic phase to occur. Primary amide 23 demonstrated remarkable selectivity for extracting gold from mixedmetal systems representative of mixtures obtained by acidic leaching of printed circuit boards, such as those found in mobile phones. Once the organic solvent phase containing these clusters had been isolated, the addition of a clean, aqueous solution resulted in the back transfer of the [AuCl 4 ] À into the new aqueous phase. This allowed the gold to be easily isolated and the ligand to be re-used for further extractions. Ligands 24 and 25 were found to extract [AuCl 4 ] À more efficiently than 23 from single metal solutions; however, their efficiency in extracting gold from mixed metal solutions was greatly reduced. The authors found that the presence of other metals such as Fe(III) and Sn(IV) caused the formation of a goldrich third phase in extractions using 24 and 25. The presence of Fe(III) and Sn(IV) in the third phase in addition to [AuCl 4 ] À complicated the clean isolation of gold species. This finding demonstrates the complications that can arise when increasing the complexity of model experiments to better represent realworld applications.involving 23 indicated that phase transfer occurred through the assembly of clusters of [AuCl 4 ] À with one protonated and one neutral amide, yielding overall charge neutral structures stabilised by a combination of hydrogen bonding and columbic attraction (Fig. 21(b)). 140 The overall charge neutrality of the clusters means that ion pairing is not required for transport into the organic phase to occur.

        <p>Oil spills are hugely damaging environmental disasters that have a severe, adverse effect on freshwater and marine ecosystems. 142 Effective clean-up strategies can help to mitigate the damage caused by oil spills by dispersing or removing the oil from the aqueous environment. The use of organogelators in this application has been reviewed by Sureshan and Vibhute. 143 Another established strategy for the remediation of light oil spills is the addition of elasticity agents, such as Elastol, 144 to the oil. Elastol is a powdered formulation of a long-chain hydrophobic polymer which dissolves in the oil and modifies its mechanical properties through gelatinisation/solidification. The effect is to limit the dispersion of the oil and to increase the ease of physically recovering it from the surface of the water.Oil spills are hugely damaging environmental disasters that have a severe, adverse effect on freshwater and marine ecosystems. 142 Effective clean-up strategies can help to mitigate the damage caused by oil spills by dispersing or removing the oil from the aqueous environment.

        <p>Targeting a similar remediation strategy, there is interest in developing supramolecular phase-selective organogelators (PSOGs) that can form organogels from biphasic oil/water mixtures and thus trap the oil. 145 In a recent review, Okesola and Smith highlighted that supramolecular gelators with a plausible chance of application in this context must be based on low cost, non-toxic components and must gel rapidly in high salt conditions without the need for a carrier solvent, heating or agitation. 146 The gels formed must be stable at low temperatures and to shear forces to aid with physical recovery. The possibility of recovering the oil via distillation is also economically attractive and could facilitate re-use of the gelator.Targeting a similar remediation strategy, there is interest in developing supramolecular phase-selective organogelators (PSOGs) that can form organogels from biphasic oil/water mixtures and thus trap the oil. 145 In a recent review, Okesola and Smith highlighted that supramolecular gelators with a plausible chance of application in this context must be based on low cost, non-toxic components and must gel rapidly in high salt conditions without the need for a carrier solvent, heating or agitation. 146 The gels formed must be stable at low temperatures and to shear forces to aid with physical recovery.

        <p>While a number of patents exist describing the application of supramolecular gelators such as dibenzylidene-D-sorbitol 147 and 12-hydroxystearic acid 148 in this context, developing PSOG systems that meet all of the above requirements remains an ongoing challenge. In recent work, Zhang, Wang, Song and co-workers reported gelators 26-28 (Fig. 22(a)) via a 2-step synthesis. 149 While all three gelators formed stable gels in aromatic and hydrocarbon solvents via the heating-cooling method, and 26 and 28 could gel fuel oils such as kerosene and diesel with low critical gelation concentrations (o0.1% w/v), only gelator 26 could form room temperature, biphasic gels with fuel oils when applied as a powder (i.e. in the absence of a carrier solvent). A combination of FT-IR and 1 H NMR analysis indicated the self-assembly of 26-28 was driven by the synergistic formation of hydrogen bonding (amide and hydroxyl groups), p-p stacking (aromatic units) and van der Waals forces (alkyl chains) as shown in Fig. 22(b). SEM, PXRD and FT-IR of xerogels and pristine powders indicated that unsaturation (26) or branching (27) in the chains of the gelators lead to looser packing in the solid state, yielding porous structures with lipophilic surfaces. The authors concluded that these structures were more accessible to oil solvents and that the van der Waals interactions between chains were weaker when the packing was looser and more easily disrupted by oil. Hence, only gelator 26 was able to dissolve to form a gel without a carrier solvent or heating.While a number of patents exist describing the application of supramolecular gelators such as dibenzylidene-D-sorbitol 147 and 12-hydroxystearic acid 148 in this context, developing PSOG systems that meet all of the above requirements remains an ongoing challenge.

        <p>Powdered gelator 26 was also found to gel a range of fuel oils including gasoline, diesel and seven types of crude oil in biphasic seawater mixtures without the need for a carrier solvent, heating or agitation. The gels formed at biphasic critical gelation concentrations between 2-7% w/v, and were stable to acidic and basic media. Light oils could be gelled within 1 minute (5% w/v), although heavy crude oils required a longer gelation time (up to 7 minutes at 10% w/v). Lighter oils could still be gelled at the lower temperature of 5 1C, while heavier oils solidified. Rheometry measurements indicated good mechanical properties and strength which could mean that the gels are suitable for simple salvage in a remediation process. This gelator was also found to be non-toxic in zebrafish, and the crude oil recovery could be scaled up to recover 35 mL of crude oil in an attempt to better simulate a large scale, real-life recovery.Powdered gelator 26 was also found to gel a range of fuel oils including gasoline, diesel and seven types of crude oil in biphasic seawater mixtures without the need for a carrier solvent, heating or agitation.

        <p>Another environmental problem that supramolecular chemistry has been applied to is the removal of organic micropollutants from water. These pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and organic dyes, have detrimental effects both to the health of ecosystems, and to human health. 150 In response to this, Alsbaiee and co-workers have developed mesoporous polymers by crosslinking b-CD with tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile, yielding a material capable of forming host-guest complexes with a range of common organic pollutants including plastic components, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and aromatic carcinogens. Not only does this material offer adsorption rates of 15-200 times greater than leading alternatives, it can also be regenerated through mild washing processes with no loss in performance. 151 Such technology would be well suited to continuous flow water treatment.Another environmental problem that supramolecular chemistry has been applied to is the removal of organic micropollutants from water.

However, the authors noted that that no technology to meet this need had yet been identified and concluded that there was great potential for molecularrecognition approaches to provide a solution to this problem.

        <p>Despite the relative ease of engineering anion receptors that bind strongly to sulfate (particularly in organic solvents), its high hydration energy means that extracting sulfate from aqueous solution is challenging. Another key consideration for nuclear waste treatment is the ability to recognise and extract sulfate anions in the presence of high concentrations of nitrate anions, which are less hydrophilic and thereby an easier target to extract into a hydrophobic environment.Despite the relative ease of engineering anion receptors that bind strongly to sulfate (particularly in organic solvents), its high hydration energy means that extracting sulfate from aqueous solution is challenging.

        <p>In 2018, Williams and Moyer et al. reported the simple di(imino)guanidinium receptor 29-Cl shown in Fig. 23(a). 18 The synthesis of this receptor was relatively straightforward (68.6% over 3 steps). In liquid-liquid anion extraction experiments using 1,2-DCE as a receiving phase, 29 was found to efficiently extract sulfate from an aqueous phase and outperformed the commercial anion extractant Aliquat 336 (A336) in both extraction efficiency and selectivity. Receptor 29 displayed a remarkable selectivity for sulfate over chloride, even when chloride was present in 100Â excess. When the extraction was performed with the solvent Isopar L (a commonly used solvent in industrial extractions), the selectivity factor (SF) for sulfate over chloride was as high as 4300; for context, the authors noted that SF values 41 are rare in the literature.In 2018, Williams and Moyer et al. reported the simple di(imino)guanidinium receptor 29-Cl shown in Fig. 23(a). 18 The synthesis of this receptor was relatively straightforward (68.6% over 3 steps).

        <p>Based on previous studies which suggested that iminoguanidiniums can interact with partially hydrated sulfate anions, [153][154][155] the authors speculated that sulfate-water clusters could be extracted by 29-Cl. They reasoned that the sulfate anion cannot achieve coordinative saturation (12 hydrogen bonds) from 29-Cl receptors alone on steric grounds, and hence concluded that the sulfate must also be coordinated by associated water molecules. Correspondingly, the X-ray crystal structure of a simpler analogue of 29 complexed with sulfate revealed that the anion was coordinated by four receptors and, one water molecule and one DMSO molecule (Fig. 23(c)). The ability of 29-Cl to extract sulfate without total de-solvation could explain the remarkable selectivity observed.Based on previous studies which suggested that iminoguanidiniums can interact with partially hydrated sulfate anions, [153][154][155] the authors speculated that sulfate-water clusters could be extracted by 29-Cl.

        <p>Recent work from Roman ´ski et al. reported the squaramidebased ion pair receptor 30 (Fig. 23(b)), able to extract K 2 SO 4 from water into organic solvents. While many sulfate extraction systems have been based on charged anion receptors that produce charge-neutral, organic-soluble complexes with sulfate, this can require the use of bulky counterions. In this case the need for bulky counterions is avoided, since the neutral receptor can cooperatively bind to both anions and cations to achieve charge balance. Receptor 30 was found to interact with a range of monovalent anions forming 1 : 1 complexes, and the addition of one equivalent of Na + or K + lead to an enhancement in anion binding strength in all cases, with the greatest effect observed for K + due to preferential binding to the benzo-18-crown-6 unit. However, titrations with divalent SO 4 2À revealed that more complex binding stoichiometries were forming. In particular, titrations with TBA 2 SO 4 carried out in the presence of K + produced a two-step binding isotherm that could not be fitted to a simple binding model. Careful analysis of the 1 H NMR titration data obtained in CD 3 CN solution indicated that a 4 : 1 (receptor : anion) complex forms under these conditions, and DOSY-NMR and DLS confirmed the formation of large supramolecular assemblies with hydrodynamic diameter d H = 28 nm. The X-ray crystal structure of 30 with Na 2 SO 4 is shown in Fig. 23(d), and demonstrates the formation of a 4 : 1 (receptor : anion) complex, in which the sulfate anion is encapsulated by four ligands (Fig. 23(d)). The overall complex remains charge neutral as two Na + cations are bound within the benzocrown cavities.Recent work from Roman ´ski et al. reported the squaramidebased ion pair receptor 30 (Fig. 23(b)), able to extract K 2 SO 4 from water into organic solvents.

        <p>This difference in binding behaviour towards monovalent and divalent anions prompted the authors to investigate the ability of 30 to differentiate these species under extraction conditions. Atomic emission spectroscopy and ion chromatography were used to quantify the extraction efficiency of 30 towards K 2 SO 4 from water to chloroform in the presence of different competing salts. An aqueous mixture of KNO 3 and K 2 SO 4 was extracted with a solution of 30 in chloroform; the concentration of sulfates in the aqueous phase was reduced by up to 74%, whilst a drop of just 7.2% was observed for nitrate. The authors proposed that the greater organic-solubility of the 4 : 1 (receptor : anion) complexes formed with divalent anions compared to the 1 : 1 complexes formed with monovalent anions underpinned the extraction selectivity.This difference in binding behaviour towards monovalent and divalent anions prompted the authors to investigate the ability of 30 to differentiate these species under extraction conditions.

        <p>Recently, Jolliffe and co-workers have developed the lipophilic, macrocyclic squaramide receptor 31 shown in Fig. 24(a), which is capable of extracting sulfate from water into a hydrophobic solvent phase, and also of transporting sulfate across a bulk chloroform membrane in U-tube experiments. 156 The authors suggest that the advantage of using a transport rather than extraction process for sulfate removal is that the extractant -in this case the organic macrocycle -can be Despite also forming strong complexes with nitrate anions (K a 4 10 4 M À1 in chloroform-d), 31 could selectively extract sulfate from water to chloroform-d in the presence of TBANO 3 . The identity of the extracted macrocycle-anion complex was determined based on distinct 1 H NMR signatures. However, the lipophilic tetrabutylammonium counterion was required for successful extraction, and no anion extraction was observed when only sodium salts were used. Washing a chloroform-d solution of 31ÁSO 4 2À with aqueous Ba(NO 3 ) 2 lead to the precipitation of BaSO 4 and generation of 31ÁNO 3 À via anion metathesis. Based on this regeneration of the sulfate-free species, the authors designed a U-tube experiment to investigate sulfate transport across a bulk chloroform membrane (Fig. 24(b)). The sulfate concentrations of the aqueous phases were monitored over time using a modified BaSO 4 gravimetric analysis coupled with ICP-MS. In the absence of an ion source in the organic phase, no transport was observed; however, when five equivalents of TBANO 3 was dissolved in the organic phase, sulfate transport was enabled. A 2-fold increase in sulfate transport was obtained by adding BaCl 2 to the receiving phase, which resulted in BaSO 4 precipitation, removing sulfate from solution and driving the transport of further equivalents of the anion.Recently, Jolliffe and co-workers have developed the lipophilic, macrocyclic squaramide receptor 31 shown in Fig. 24(a), which is capable of extracting sulfate from water into a hydrophobic solvent phase, and also of transporting sulfate across a bulk chloroform membrane in U-tube experiments. 156 The authors suggest that the advantage of using a transport rather than extraction process for sulfate removal is that the extractant -in this case the organic macrocycle -can be Despite also forming strong complexes with nitrate anions (K a 4 10 4 M À1 in chloroform-d), 31 could selectively extract sulfate from water to chloroform-d in the presence of TBANO 3 .

        <p>The separation and refinement of chemical species is an essential industrial process, with a large environmental and economic impact. Indeed, distillation currently accounts for between 10-15% of global energy consumption. 157 In 2016 Sholl and Lively outlined 'seven chemical separations to change the world', offering adsorption and separation as a pathway to reducing the environmental impact. 158 To be effective separation agents, adsorptive materials require high surface areas. Many such materials have been reported, including but not limited to, MOFs, 159 covalent organic frameworks (COFs) 160 and zeolites. [161][162][163] Whilst these classes of materials represent steps forward within this field, large macromolecular structures lead to poor solubility, and the presence of reversible bonds often limit stability. These factors preclude the use of these materials in solution-based separation processes. Arguably the step-change within this area can be attributed to work by Huang and co-workers who have pioneered the development of NACs, utilizing supramolecular assembly to overcome these limitations. 103 As previously discussed, NACs are nonporous in their initial crystalline state however, upon the introduction of guest species a reversible crystal structure transformation occurs, generating porosity in situ. Within the scope of this review we seek to bring to the reader's attention NAC separation systems with commercially relevant applications however, for a more inclusive review of this area we refer the reader to a mini review published by Yang, another of this fields forefathers. 164 One of the first examples we wish to highlight from this area is that of Cooper, Huang and co-workers, who have demonstrated the ability of NACs constructed of pillar [5]arene 32 (EtP5) and pillar [6]arene 33 (EtP6), Fig. 25, to separate styrene and ethylbenzene, 165 one of Sholl and Lively's seven targeted chemical separations. 158 Styrene is used in the production of a variety of polymeric materials (e.g. synthetic rubbers, plastics and resins), and is produced through the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. Due to inefficiencies in this process, steam produced during the synthetic procedure often contains unreacted ethylbenzene, which must then be removed. Owing to the similar boiling points of styrene and ethylbenzene (146 and 136 1C respectively), 166 conventional distillation is not practical, and as a result separating these two compounds requires complex and energy intensive processes. 167 The authors instead utilize the EtP5 and EtP6 NACs, taking advantage of the small differences in the geometry of styrene and ethylbenzene (Fig. 26(a-c)), the presence of which initiates crystallization processes resulting in the formation of porous materials with differing stabilities. The crystalline material containing styrene is far more stable than that of ethylbenzene, meaning that the solid crystalline material containing the styrene prevails, and can easily be separated. Starting from a 50 : 50 mixture of ethylbenzene and styrene, this process has been shown to produce styrene with 499% purity. Further to this, as the crystallization of EtP6 is directed by the presence of styrene, it is not necessary to start with crystalline EtP6, and as such it can be recycled through heating with no loss of styrene capturing ability, Fig. 26.The separation and refinement of chemical species is an essential industrial process, with a large environmental and economic impact. Indeed, distillation currently accounts for between 10-15% of global energy consumption. 157 In 2016 Sholl and Lively outlined 'seven chemical separations to change the world', offering adsorption and separation as a pathway to reducing the environmental impact. 158 To be effective separation agents, adsorptive materials require high surface areas. Many such materials have been reported, including but not limited to, MOFs, 159 covalent organic frameworks (COFs) 160 and zeolites. [161][162][163] Whilst these classes of materials represent steps forward within this field, large macromolecular structures lead to poor solubility, and the presence of reversible bonds often limit stability. These factors preclude the use of these materials in solution-based separation processes.

        <p>para-Xylene is another commercially important compound used in the production of a variety of polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyester. 158 However, the synthesis of this compound results in a mixture of ortho-, meta-and para-xylene, which again are difficult to separate using conventional distillation procedures. Here again the NAC EtP6 material was found to be effective in the separation of para-xylene from a mixture with its other isomers, achieving a purity of 90% and providing a less energy intensive route towards another industrially relevant starting material. 168 In the interest of developing separation methodologies with even lower energy demands, Khasab and co-workers have further developed this work. These authors utilized a water soluble pillar [5]arene derivate to perform separations of xylene isomers using a liquid-liquid extraction methodology, achieving a selectivity of over 88%. 169 Haloalkanes and haloalkenes are another class of chemicals with great industrial significance as high value feedstocks within the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. 170 Traditionally, these compounds are synthesized through direct halogenation. Due to selectivity issues, this produces reaction mixtures that require complex purification. 171 To this end, Yang and co-workers report a new class of NACs, desolvated perethylated leaning pillar [6]arenes (EtLP6). This tilted version of the EtP6 scaffold offers enhanced guest binding ability as well as good cavity adaptability, Fig. 27. 172 Through a similar solid vapour adsorption method as previously reported, 168 EtLP6 is able to separate the 1-bromo and 2-bromo isomers of bromopropane, bromobutane and bromopentane with 89.6%, 93.8% and 96.3% purity respectively. 173 Additionally, the separation of 1-chlorobutane from 2-chlorobutane and vice versa has since been achieved using EtP5 and EtP6 respectively. 170 As with EtP6, when freed of guests the EtLP6 material may also be reused, and shows no loss of separation ability after being recycled five times.para-Xylene is another commercially important compound used in the production of a variety of polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyester. 158 However, the synthesis of this compound results in a mixture of ortho-, meta-and para-xylene, which again are difficult to separate using conventional distillation procedures.

        <p>Moving beyond pillar[n]arenes, Huang and co-workers have also utilized CB [6], referred to by the authors as (Q [6]), in the formation of NACs, Fig. 28(a-c). 174 Toluene and pyridine are both important solvents, and are also used in polymer production and for catalysis. The industrial preparation of toluene is often contaminated with pyridine impurities which, similarly to the previous examples, are problematic to remove through distillation. 175 The authors found that pyridine was capable of forming a host:guest complex with CB [6], whilst toluene was not. It is as a result of this selective complexation event that this material has been shown to completely remove the pyridine impurities separate from crude toluene, Fig. 28(d).Moving beyond pillar[n]arenes, Huang and co-workers have also utilized CB [6], referred to by the authors as (Q [6]), in the formation of NACs, Fig. 28(a-c). 174 Toluene and pyridine are both important solvents, and are also used in polymer production and for catalysis.

        <p>Supramolecular materials are constructed using non-covalent forces such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatics and hydrophobic/ hydrophilic interactions. 176 The reversibility and dynamic nature of these interactions results in the production of materials with unique properties, 177 capable of responding to temperature, 178 mechanical stress, 179 pH 180 and the presence of small molecules. 5,181,182 These materials are often produced through the combination of traditional covalent polymers with functionalities that are capable of binding through supramolecular forces. True supramolecular polymers are those in which the monomers themselves are not polymeric in nature, distinguishing them from supramolecular polymeric hybrid materials. 183 They were defined by Sijbesma as ''polymeric arrays of monomeric units that are brought together by reversible and highly directional secondary interactions, resulting in polymeric properties in dilute and concentrated solutions, as well as in the bulk. The monomeric units of the supramolecular polymers themselves do not possess a repetition of chemical fragments.'' 184 The reversible nature of supramolecular bonds enables the production of self-healing materials.

        <p>Coatings are applied to surfaces to protect them from the external environment; however, these coatings often need to be re-applied due to everyday 'wear and tear' degrading surface integrity. Here, supramolecular self-healing materials, developed as protective coatings, offer increased longevity when compared to traditional alternatives such as paints, resins and plastics. 189 Such traditional materials require manual intervention to remove defects such as scratches, particularly important when considering high value goods.

        <p>Coatings such of this type have already been used in the automotive industry. One example is polyrotaxane paints that have been in used in the car manufacturing industry, specifically by Nissan (since 2005), 13 to prevent the need for scratch repair on vehicles. The same manufacturer has also expanded the applications of this technology, producing a self-healing smartphone case, reported to be able to fix minor abrasions in under an hour. Working with mobile operator NTT DoCoMo, and with Advanced Softmaterials Inc., a University of Tokyo based company, Nissan also aims to incorporate this class of materials directly into the production of the next generation of smartphones. 13 Rotaxanes are a class of interlocked molecules, featuring the general structure shown in Fig. 29. 190 Polyrotaxanes, a sub-class of the rotaxane family, feature a single molecular axle that passes through multiple macrocycles. They have been extensively studied by 2016 Nobel Prize winning chemists Stoddart and Sauvage. 9,191 The polyrotaxane macrocycles are free to move along the molecular axle due to the lack of covalent bonding between the two, and it is this property that gives rise to their potential commercial material applications. 192 Due to the popularity of these systems, multiple comprehensive reviews have been published on the synthesis, properties and potential applications of these compounds. [192][193][194] An example highlighting the application of polyrotaxanes in the production of supramolecular self-healing materials is provided by Harada and co-workers, Fig. 30. This work shows how supramolecular rotaxane systems can be combined with dynamic covalent bonds 195 to produce materials that can selfheal through both physical (supramolecular) and chemical (dynamic covalent chemistry) mechanisms. Here, the supramolecular 'mechanical bond' allows the physical movement of cyclodextrin macrocycles along their axle to compensate for external stress, while the dynamic covalent bonds can break and reform at new positions, healing the material to a greater degree of strength.Coatings such of this type have already been used in the automotive industry.

        <p>This combination of dynamic covalent and supramolecular chemistry was initially utilised in the development of supramolecular gels, giving rise to systems that when physically split in two, could be re-joined to recover 83% of the original sample strength in only five minutes. 15 The recovery of material strength in this instance is attributed to the dynamic nature of the boronic acid-diol bond, a feature that has seen their use in an ever-increasing number of functional materials. 6,196 As exemplified by Harada, material self-healing is a common attribute in wet materials such as hydrogels. However, further development of this dynamic covalent-supramolecular system has allowed for a step-change toward also achieving this selfhealing functionality within dry materials. This has classically been problematic, due to the decreased diffusivity inherent in systems that are not associated with a solvent. The addition of a commercially available photoinitiator (in this case Irgacure 2959), and subsequent exposure of the mixture to UV light, enabled the polyrotaxane-boronate system to become further crosslinked, resulting in the production of a scratch healable coating that can be applied to hard surfaces.This combination of dynamic covalent and supramolecular chemistry was initially utilised in the development of supramolecular gels, giving rise to systems that when physically split in two, could be re-joined to recover 83% of the original sample strength in only five minutes. 15 The recovery of material strength in this instance is attributed to the dynamic nature of the boronic acid-diol bond, a feature that has seen their use in an ever-increasing number of functional materials. 6,196 As exemplified by Harada, material self-healing is a common attribute in wet materials such as hydrogels.

        <p>Rubbers are a 'dry' polymer with numerous applications worldwide from automobile fixtures and fittings to pencil erasers, and have an estimated global market value of 31.3 billion dollars (2019), which is predicted to increase. 197 However, these materials suffer from poor longevity, lack of re-processability, and have a heavy environmental impact. Here, we showcase the efforts of supramolecular chemists to develop rubbers that are self-healing, and therefore exhibit longer useful lifetimes. Some of the described supramolecular rubbers can be recycled, resulting in the production of materials that act as a greener alternative to traditional systems. Practical applications of such supramolecular rubbers would be varied; it is easy to imagine that such technology would allow for the development of selfhealing tyres with the potential to reduce automotive accidents, and decrease reducing upkeep costs. 198 As previously mentioned, materials that exhibit self-healing properties in dry conditions are more challenging to develop. The lack of co-solvents makes this process problematic as the production of supramolecular rubbers often involves the combination of non-covalent, reversible (often polar) and covalent (often non-polar) crosslinkers. 199 Weitz et al. report the use of randomly branched polymers, containing motifs capable of acting as both reversible supramolecular and covalent crosslinkers (Fig. 32), generating a self-healing hybrid elastomer that exhibited a fracture energy of 13 500 J m À2 , which is comparable to natural rubber. 16 To develop this material towards commercial applications, Weitz et al. reacted diamine and acrylic acid monomeric units, to generate randomly branched polymers consisting of monosubstituted, di-substituted and tri-substituted amides. The unreacted, pre-polymer, monomeric mixture is a viscous liquid, which can be poured/injected into a mould. On heating the mixture above 150 1C, condensation reactions occur between the amine and carboxyl groups contained within the monomeric units, resulting in covalent crosslinks, which secure a three-dimensional network that can maintain the shape of a mould. The ease by which this material can be formed into specific shapes has advantages when considering material manufacture for a variety of potential applications. The selfhealing properties of this class of materials arises from the presence of the secondary amide groups, produced from the reactions of these monomeric units. Here the amide groups act as both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, further stabilising the structure of the material through the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds (Fig. 32).Rubbers are a 'dry' polymer with numerous applications worldwide from automobile fixtures and fittings to pencil erasers, and have an estimated global market value of 31.3 billion dollars (2019), which is predicted to increase. 197 However, these materials suffer from poor longevity, lack of re-processability, and have a heavy environmental impact.

        <p>Within this material small deformations can be self-healed though the reformation of reversible amide-amide hydrogen bond however, larger deformations that result in the breaking of covalent bonds yield non-reversible material damage. 200 In this combination approach, only the reversible hydrogen bonds can reform, therefore the material only recovers 30% of its mechanical strength when stretched beyond the limit of the covalent crosslinks.Within this material small deformations can be self-healed though the reformation of reversible amide-amide hydrogen bond however, larger deformations that result in the breaking of covalent bonds yield non-reversible material damage. 200 In this combination approach, only the reversible hydrogen bonds can reform, therefore the material only recovers 30% of its mechanical strength when stretched beyond the limit of the covalent crosslinks.</p>
        <p>Butyl rubber is a commonly used synthetic substitute for natural rubber and is produced from the reaction of isobutylene and isoprene. The inclusion of alkyl halides into butyl rubber has been found to increase material crosslinking efficacy, when incorporating agents such as sulfur and epoxides. 201 In line with material developments in this area, Heinrich et al. have developed a simple methodology for the conversion of the widely used bromobutyl material into a selfhealing rubber. Here, as shown in Fig. 33, the introduction of butylimidazole groups (34) allowed the material to crosslink with ionic bonds, rather than covalent. The incorporation of reversible supramolecular bonds, resulted in a material capable of self-healing. 198 The introduction of ionic interactions into the covalent bromobutyl rubber network negates the need for further additives such as sulphur or peroxides, yielding a material with an elastic modulus superior to that of conventional rubbers. 201 The tensile strength of this butylimidazole incorporated bromobutyl rubber was found to be greater than of the conventional sulphur crosslinked bromobutyl rubber (9 and 8 MPa respectively). In addition, when comparing the stretchability of both materials, the supramolecular system again outperformed the conventional sulfur system (1000% and E800% stretchability respectively). As can be seen in Fig. 34, the reversible nature of the ionic interactions within this material is able to facilitate molecular rearrangement, allowing separate pieces of the material to be re-joined. Further alteration of the materials molecular structure (varying the n-alkyl chain length) has led to the identification of a distinct correlation between alkyl chain mobility and self-healing properties. Extending this approach, Bo ¨hme et al. have demonstrated that the mechanical properties of these materials may also be tuned through an alteration of chain length. 202 The re-processability of covalently crosslinked rubbers is limited, due to the complex and energy intensive processes involved. 203 In an effort to overcome this limitation, Bo ¨hme et al. introduced complimentary hydrogen bond donating and Fig. 33 The introduction of butylimidazole groups into bromobutyl rubber, yielding groups able to crosslink rubbers through ionic bonds.Butyl rubber is a commonly used synthetic substitute for natural rubber and is produced from the reaction of isobutylene and isoprene.

        <p>The application of supramolecular chemistry in the development of traditional adhesives has already been discussed, however recent advances in material development have also led to the creation of a 'velcro'-like material, capable of reversible adhesion underwater. 205 Such materials have a wide variety of uses in moist environments, such as the repair of leaks in piping, the fixing of ordnance and beacons to surfaces, as well as in a surgical setting. 206 However, creating materials capable of bonding underwater is challenging, due to the interference of water at the interface between the adhesive and adhered surfaces. The presence of water molecules at the interface inhibits adhesivesurface contact, and thus prevents efficient fastening. 207 Previous attempts to develop such materials have often looked to nature for inspiration. Mussels, barnacles and other sea dwelling species produce natural adhesives that can bind strongly despite the aqueous environments. 206,208 This property arises from the increase prevalence of catechol containing 3,4dihydroxyl-L-phenylalanine (DOPA) residues within the protein adhesives that these aquatic species secrete. This has led to the production of a number of catechol containing biomimetic underwater adhesive polymers. 209,210 These adhesive materials have been explored in great detail and have been extensively reviewed. [211][212][213] A limiting factor of the catechol containing adhesives produced to date is their inability to act as reversible bonding agents. Further to this, curing agents must be added to complete the adhesion processes, 214 which can be problematic for certain applications. Kim et al. took a purely synthetic route in their approach to the development of a 'supramolecular velcro' adhesive. The formation of host-guest supramolecular complexes in aqueous solutions is accompanied by expulsion of water molecules from hydrophobic host cavities. 215 One such host-guest pairing, uses CB [7] as the host and aminomethylferrocene as the guest, complexation between the host and guest results in a K a E 10 12 M À1 . 216 Here, the host CB [7] was bound to one surface to be adhered, and aminomethylferrocene was bound to the second, Fig. 36. When the two surfaces are brought together, complexation occurs between the host and guest, driven entropically by the expulsion of water from the hydrophobic cavity.The application of supramolecular chemistry in the development of traditional adhesives has already been discussed, however recent advances in material development have also led to the creation of a 'velcro'-like material, capable of reversible adhesion underwater. 205 Such materials have a wide variety of uses in moist environments, such as the repair of leaks in piping, the fixing of ordnance and beacons to surfaces, as well as in a surgical setting. 206 However, creating materials capable of bonding underwater is challenging, due to the interference of water at the interface between the adhesive and adhered surfaces. The presence of water molecules at the interface inhibits adhesivesurface contact, and thus prevents efficient fastening. 207 Previous attempts to develop such materials have often looked to nature for inspiration.

        <p>The strength of this supramolecular adhesive was found to be greater than that of commercial alternatives (3Mt Velcro, 3Mt double sided tape and 3Mt double sided foam tape), when tested both in air and underwater. Similarly, when compared to previously reported mollusc inspired adhesive polymers, this material displayed similar adhesive strengths, without the need for curing agents (mussel derived adhesion strength: 1.5 MPa 217 and 1.2 MPa; 218 CB [7] adhesion strength: 1.12 MPa). 207 It was possible to tune the strength of adhesion for the CB [7]/aminomethylferrocene 'velcro' by varying the density of the host and guest molecules present on the separate surfaces. Much like conventional velcro, this adhesion of the CB [7]/ aminomethylferrocene 'velcro' was reversible when broken mechanically, owing to its self-healing ability obtained through reversible complexation events. The adhesive bond of the material was also chemically switchable, thanks to the redoxactive nature of the aminomethylferrocene. On immersion of the aminomethylferrocene surface in a 10 mM solution of NaClO, the oxidation of the aminomethylferrocene turned off the adhesion, as the oxidised species no longer acts as an effective guest. 219 The guest surface was found to be reactivated through exposure to ascorbic acid (20 mM) however, this only resulted in 44% of the original adhesive strength. 205 Adhesives, both supramolecular and traditional, are often polymeric in nature. These include resins, bioadhesive gels and all previously discussed systems. In contrast, low molecular monomeric units as adhesives have received limited interest in the field, with few systems having been reported. 220 One example of such a system was produced by Dong and co-workers, who developed a crown-ether containing, low molecular weight supramolecular adhesive, 36, capable of tough and stable adhesion of a range of materials in seawater over periods of twelve months, Fig. 37. 221 This novel material was able to bind to both hydrophobic (PTFE and Teflon) and hydrophilic materials (steel and glass). This is thought to be due to a combination of the large range of supramolecular interactions that it can form, including hydrogen bonds, electrostatic forces, p-p stacking, hydrophobic interactions and metal complexation. Here, similar adhesive strengths (1.94 MPa compared to 2.02 MPa) could be achieved with almost ten times less material (1.25 mg cm À2 compared to 11.6 mg cm À2 ). Furthermore, to prepare a 20 cm 2 area of this adhesive by hand required an hour however, it was found that this same area could also be prepared through electrospinning in just one minute. The versatility of this material has been shown through real life testing in which it has been used as a patch (Fig. 38) to repair breakages in glass flasks, plastic centrifuge tubes and water pipes.The strength of this supramolecular adhesive was found to be greater than that of commercial alternatives (3Mt Velcro, 3Mt double sided tape and 3Mt double sided foam tape), when tested both in air and underwater.

        <p>As previously discussed, polyrotaxane based materials offer unique physical properties. The 'sliding' of the macrocycles along a molecular axle allows them to efficiently dissipate energy. This has sparked investigation into their use as binder materials in lithium ion batteries. The use of silicon particles as an anode material in these batteries shows great promise, however during charge-discharge cycles the silicon undergoes large volume changes, resulting in particle destruction. 222 Elastic materials are thus added to prevent this effect, traditionally this material is polyacrylic acid. Choi and co-workers have shown that with the addition of 5% w/w polyrotaxane to the binder material, the elasticity is greatly increased. 223 The inclusion abilities of this supramolecular motif has yielded a material capable of increasing the lifetime of these high capacity batteries to commercially viable levels.As previously discussed, polyrotaxane based materials offer unique physical properties.

        <p>The varied and unique properties that the application of supramolecular chemistry can bring to products is only now being realised. Huge leaps in host guest chemistries are paving the way towards more accurate real time glucose sensors, previously dangerous chemical warfare agent disposal is being made safe through the use of gels, and soon a punctured tyre may be capable of simply repairing itself. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the expansive research occurring within supramolecular chemistry with great potential for commercialisation, and work continues in many groups that will yield even more impressive materials, sensors and other applicationsbased chemistries. We hope that by highlighting a of areas in which supramolecular chemistry has moved out of the lab and into the real world, we may inspire others to make this transition with their own scientific endeavours.The varied and unique properties that the application of supramolecular chemistry can bring to products is only now being realised.
