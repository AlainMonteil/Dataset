        <p>The over-accumulation of glycogen appears as a hallmark in various glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), including Pompe, Cori, Andersen and Lafora disease. Accumulating evidence suggests that suppression of glycogen accumulation represents a potential therapeutic approach for treating these GSDs. Using a fluorescence polarization assay designed to screen for inhibitors of the key glycogen synthetic enzyme, glycogen synthase (GS), we identified a substituted imidazole, (rac H23), as a first-in-class inhibitor for yeast glycogen synthase 2 (yGsy2p). Data from X-ray crystallography at 2.85 Å, as well as kinetic data, revealed that H23 bound within the UDP-glucose binding pocket of yGsy2p. The high conservation of residues between human and yeast GS in direct contact with H23 informed the development of around 500 H23 analogs.The over-accumulation of glycogen appears as a hallmark in various glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), including Pompe, Cori, Andersen and Lafora disease.

        <p>These analogs produced a structure-activity relationship (SAR) profile that led to the identification of a substituted pyrazole, 4-(4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)pyrogallol, with 300-fold improved potency against human GS. These substituted pyrazoles possess a promising scaffold for drug development efforts targeting GS activity in GSDs associated with excess glycogen accumulation.These analogs produced a structure-activity relationship (SAR) profile that led to the identification of a substituted pyrazole, 4-(4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)pyrogallol, with 300-fold improved potency against human GS.

        <p>Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose, composed of chains thirteen residues long on average, arranged in layers to form a molecule of up 10 7 daltons, corresponding to 55,000 glucose units. The biosynthesis of glycogen is a highly conserved, complex and coordinated process that involves two key events. Glycogen synthase (GS) lengthens linear chains through the progressive addition of -1,4-linked glucose residues to the non-reducing end of the polymer, and glycogen-branching enzyme (GBE) catalyzes the intramolecular transfer of seven glucose residues from the end of a linear chain to a C-6 hydroxyl group to produce -1,6 branch points for further elongation 1,2,3,4 .Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose, composed of chains thirteen residues long on average, arranged in layers to form a molecule of up 10 7 daltons, corresponding to 55,000 glucose units.

        <p>GS is the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen biosynthesis 5 . Higher eukaryotes have two isoforms, GYS1 and GYS2 6,7 , that share approximately 70% sequence identity at the amino acid level and display the greatest variation within the N-and C-terminal sequence extensions where regulatory sites are located. The two GS isoenzymes are differentially expressed: GYS2 is exclusively expressed in the liver, while expression of GYS1 is highest in skeletal muscle but is also expressed in most other tissues. These two principal storage tissues for glycogen serve distinct physiological roles. Glycogen in the liver plays an essential, regulatory role in glucose homoeostasis, but glycogen in other tissues acts as an intracellular energy reserve such as during muscle contraction 8 . Similar to higher eukaryotes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two genes encoding GS, GSY1 and GSY2, with Gsy2p as the predominant isoform 9 . GS undergoes activation allosterically through glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) binding and inactivation by phosphorylation at a number of sites through the action of multiple protein kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in mammals 10,11 . After transport into cells, glucose undergoes phosphorylation to G6P and enters one of several metabolic pathways. Increased Page 3 of 48 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of Medicinal Chemistry levels of intracellular G6P stimulates GS activity that in turn drives the incorporation of glucose into glycogen in a feed-forward mechanism 12 . The dephosphorylation of GS is mediated by forms of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), the catalytic subunit of which is held in close proximity to the glycogen granule and GS by a family of glycogen targeting subunits, including protein-targeting-to-glycogen (PTG), an indirect activator of GS 13 .GS is the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen biosynthesis 5 .

        <p>Glycogen metabolism constitutes a key pathway in living cells that regulates systemic carbon or energy allocation 14 . A number of diseases are associated with abnormal glycogen metabolism including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) 15,16,17 . Defects in enzymes directly involved in either glycogen synthesis or degradation 18 are the basis for more than 12 different GSDs, and glycogen over-accumulation is characteristic of most GSDs. In Pompe disease (GSD2), a deficiency of the enzyme, acid--glucosidase (GAA), leads to lysosomal glycogen accumulation in many tissues including skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle 19 . In Cori disease (GSD3) and Andersen disease (GSD4), defects in the glycogen debranching enzyme (AGL) and glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1), respectively, result in the accumulation of glycogen with abnormal structure 20,21 . Lafora disease is a fatal progressive myoclonus epilepsy accompanied by neurodegeneration for which the presence of abnormal glycogen inclusions known as Lafora bodies 22 are the hallmark. Lafora bodies consist of poorly branched, hyperphosphorylated, and insoluble forms of glycogen that occur in neuronal, muscle and other tissues 23,24,25 . Notably, impaired glycogen metabolism and consequent glycogen accumulation was also found to be pathological for β-cell dysfunction in T2D 16,17 .Glycogen metabolism constitutes a key pathway in living cells that regulates systemic carbon or energy allocation 14 .

        <p>A common finding with excess glycogen accumulation is an association with impaired autophagy and dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism. These derangements often lead to cell death and early-onset lethal, disease progression in GSD-affected patients 16,26,27 . Currently, there are no effective treatments for GSDs that ameliorate all cellular and organ dysfunction. For example, in Pompe disease, the administration of a genetically engineered enzyme (i.e., Enzyme Replacement Therapy, ERT) that rescues the defective GAA in peripheral tissues fails to reverse the neurological defects. Partial suppression of glycogen synthesis through inhibition of GS activity represents an alternative, potentially effective strategy for treating various types of GSDs where ERT may not provide a complete solution. For instance, mouse models of Lafora disease that lack either of the causative genes, EPM2A or EPM2B, recapitulate aspects of the patient phenotype, in that they accumulate polyglucosan bodies and misfolded proteins, display increased endoplasmic reticulum stress, and show signs of neurodegeneration 23,27 . Such animal models provided a venue for disrupting either PTG or GYS1 in these EPM2A (-/-) and EPM2B (-/-) knock-out mice as a mechanism for diminishing glycogen accumulation, Lafora body formation and the associated neurological and epileptic symptoms 27,28,29,30 . Inhibition of GS activity via suppression of mTOR signaling also increases the effectiveness of treatments for Pompe disease in conjunction with ERT 31 . Moreover, a recent report has shown that GYS2 inhibition with RNAi prevents liver injury in mouse models of GSDs 32 . Although human clinical characteristics may vary from animal phenotypes, the availability of mouse models and the appearance of promising therapeutic approaches suggest the feasibility of using small-molecule interventions to treat GSDs. We now report efforts to develop small-molecule inhibitors of human GS based on a multicomponent study involving high-throughput screening (HTS), X-ray crystallography and extensive SAR development work that led to substituted pyrazoles with low micromolar, inhibitory IC 50 values against human glycogen synthase 1 (hGYS1). The standard radiochemical assay for GS activity utilizes a time-consuming 14 C-glucose incorporation assay (i.e., UDP-[U- 14 C]glucose and glycogen (n) affords [ 14 C]glycogen (n+1) and UDP) that involves appropriate safety measures for handling radioisotopes as well as multiple transfer and washing steps to remove residual substrates 33 . The combination of laboratory effort, cost, safety and waste disposal favored the development of a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay for HTS as a sensitive, inexpensive, and rapid alternative 34 . We reserved the classical radiochemical assay for subsequent studies to confirm the hits emerging from the FP assay. An FP assay utilizes a fluorescently-labeled tracer molecule that binds to GS to form a slower rotating complex than fluorophore alone and that leads to enhanced polarization of the emitted light. Incubation of the GS-fluorophore complex with small-molecules that displace the fluorescent tracer produces greater rotational motion of fluorophore than that of the GSfluorophore complex and causes relative depolarization of the emitted light. Using this assay system as a vehicle for HTS, we identified small-molecules that reduce the fluorescence polarization signal as GS-interacting agents.A common finding with excess glycogen accumulation is an association with impaired autophagy and dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism.

        <p>The development of any FP assay involves the design and synthesis of a functional, fluorescent probe. Although G6P is a well-known, allosteric activator of GS, the regioselective modification of similarly reactive hydroxyl groups in G6P presented an unwelcome challenge. Because glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) also activated GS 35 and has a single, reactive amine group, its selection as a platform on which to incorporate a fluorophore was an attractive alternative to G6P. Using the 14 C-glucose incorporation assay, we confirmed that either G6P or GlcN6P activated hGYS1 with AC 50 values of 1.6 0.1 mM or 5.9 0.1 mM, respectively ± ± (Supplemental Figure 1A). With direct evidence in hand that GlcN6P activated hGS, we synthesized a fluorophore-modified GlcN6P (aka GlcN6P-fluorescein-5-Ex) using GlcN6P and 1B).The development of any FP assay involves the design and synthesis of a functional, fluorescent probe.

        <p>We examined the binding of the fluorophore, GlcN6P-fluorescein-5-Ex, to GS by adding the tracer to varying concentrations of yGsy2p to generate a saturation binding curve and calculate a dissociation constant of 7.6 0.7 μM (Figure 1B). Furthermore, a competitive displacement by ± G6P (K d 70.9 3.6 µM) demonstrated that the tracer molecule bound to the G6P allosteric = ± site (Figure 1C). For comparison, we determined yGsy2p activation by G6P using the standard 14 C-glucose incorporation assay which yielded an AC 50 of 98.1 3.1 µM (Supplemental ± Figure 1C). We also tested the binding of GlcN6P-fluorescein-5-Ex and displacement by G6P using hGYS1. While the GlcN6P-coupled fluorophore and the fluorophore alone bound to hGYS1, G6P was unable to displace either compound, a finding that suggested nonspecific binding of the fluorophore to hGYS1. This reason, combined with the fact that production of human GYS1 in insect cells results in a heavily phosphorylated enzyme that requires very high concentrations of G6P for activity measurements, makes the full-length recombinant human enzyme unsuitable for an assay designed to displace G6P. However, since the fluorescent probe could be fully displaced from yGsy2p through competition with G6P, we used yGsy2p and not hGYS1 for HTS. The high conservation of residues within the G6P allosteric site, the active site, and overall protein sequence identity (~55%) between yGsy2p and hGYS1 further supported the decision to use the yeast enzyme as a screening surrogate for the human enzyme (Supplemental Figure 2). The robustness of the FP assay for HTS was assessed by determining the Z′-factor, a parameter reflective of both the signal dynamic range and data variability 36 . While the ideal Z′factor is 1, a Z′-factor between 0.5 and 1 is considered excellent and suitable for screening assays. The FP values for the positive controls (maximal binding, without G6P) and negative controls (fully displaced tracer, with G6P) were 109.23 ± 1.97 and 26.48 ± 1.93 (mean ± SD) from the 384-wells, respectively. The Z′-factor for this assay was determined as 0.86, indicating that this assay is well suited for HTS (Figure 1D).

        <p>We used the aforementioned FP displacement assay to screen the 50K ChemBridge Diversity library at a final assay concentration of 10 μM against the yGsy2p enzyme. The HTS was adapted to the 384-well plate format using three columns for the DMSO negative controls and one column for unlabeled G6P as the positive control, resulting in a total of 157 screening plates (Supplemental Table 1 and2). We used a Z'-score threshold of -1, corresponding to a separation of 3 standard deviations between μ c (means of the control DMSO signal) and μ s (means of the library sample signal) as a signal cutoff (Supplemental Table 2). These standards produced 117 hits and an overall 0.23% hit rate. Initial stock availability led to re-purchasing of 110 compounds (designated H1-H110) from ChemBridge and validation of their activity using the standard 14 C-glucose incorporation assay at 100 μM concentration. This approach validated 16 hits with greater than 40% inhibition of yGsy2p activity (Figure 2A).We used the aforementioned FP displacement assay to screen the 50K ChemBridge Diversity library at a final assay concentration of 10 μM against the yGsy2p enzyme.

        <p>Since the yeast yGsy2p enzyme was used as a surrogate for the human hGYS1 enzyme, we next examined if the 16 validated compounds were also active as inhibitors of hGYS1 activity. To accomplish this necessary confirmation, we redesigned the hGYS1 construct to create a constitutively active enzyme through deletion of the C-terminal phosphorylation domain (residues 635-737) and through the substitution of the two N-terminal phosphorylation sites (Ser8, Ser11) with Asn residues (designated hGYS1634S8,11N) (Figure 2B). Purification of this truncated form of GS in significant quantity led to an enzyme that exhibited an activation state of ~0.2, a ratio of GS activity in the absence over the presence of G6P as an index of the phosphorylation state of the enzyme 37 . Unlike the heavily phosphorylated, full-length enzyme produced in insect cells that had an activation state of &lt;0.01 38 , this truncated form of GS was well suited for validation assays designed to look for inhibitors because the enzyme was neither overly inhibited by phosphorylation nor rendered insensitive to the effects of G6P. At a test concentration of 100 μM, only 1 hit, namely a substituted imidazole, (rac H23), demonstrated greater than 20% inhibition using this truncated hGYS1 (Figure 2C and2D).Since the yeast yGsy2p enzyme was used as a surrogate for the human hGYS1 enzyme, we next examined if the 16 validated compounds were also active as inhibitors of hGYS1 activity.

        <p>Although there are no mammalian GS crystal structures, the structures of two eukaryotic enzymes, namely yGsy2p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 10 and GS from Caenorhabditis elegans 39 encouraged our undertaking crystallization experiments. As previously described, yeast Gsy2p existed as tetramer in the crystal structure, and each subunit contained two Rossmann-fold domains with the catalytic site in the interdomain cleft 10 . In the crystal packing environment in crystals of the activated form of GS, one subunit appeared 13.3º more closed than the other three "open" subunits 40 . We successfully determined the crystal structure of the H23-yGsy2p complex to a resolution of 2.85 Å (Table 1), and we observed H23 binding in three of the four subunits, all of which corresponded to the "open" domain positions (Figure 3B). The structure showed H23 bound within the active site of GS in a location that overlapped with the binding site for UDP-glucose (UDPG) 40 (Figure 3C and3D). Structural alignment of the R589/592A2•UDP complex to the WT•H23 complex using their C α carbons generated an overall root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.36 Å, indicating a high degree of similarity. The binding of H23 to yGsy2p was mediated by hydrogen-bond formation between the phenolic hydroxyl group of H23 and the nitrogen backbone of Leu481; hydrophobic interactions of the 2-methoxyphenol sandwiched between Tyr492 and Phe480; van der Waals interactions of the benzene group with the side chains of Phe480 and Arg320; and additional van der Waals interactions of the Nmethylpyrrolidine moiety with Tyr492, Thr514, and Glu517 (Figure 3D).Although there are no mammalian GS crystal structures, the structures of two eukaryotic enzymes, namely yGsy2p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 10 and GS from Caenorhabditis elegans 39 encouraged our undertaking crystallization experiments.

        <p>In a study of the inhibitory potential for H23 against yeast and human GS using the standard 14 Cglucose incorporation assay, H23 exhibited IC 50 values of 280 µM and 263 µM in the absence and presence, respectively, of G6P for yGsy2p (Figure 4A). The similarity in IC 50 values indicated H23 was not in direct competition with G6P. Under subsaturating G6P concentrations, the IC 50 values of H23 against either hGYS1634S8,11N or wild-type hGYS1 were 161 μM and 875 µM, respectively (Figure 4B). Even though the presence or absence of G6P did not impact H23 potency, the activity state of the human GS enzyme had a five-fold effect on the binding of H23.In a study of the inhibitory potential for H23 against yeast and human GS using the standard 14 Cglucose incorporation assay, H23 exhibited IC 50 values of 280 µM and 263 µM in the absence and presence, respectively, of G6P for yGsy2p (Figure 4A).

Under subsaturating G6P concentrations, the IC 50 values of H23 against either hGYS1634S8,11N or wild-type hGYS1 were 161 μM and 875 µM, respectively (Figure 4B). Even though the presence or absence of G6P did not impact H23 potency, the activity state of the human GS enzyme had a five-fold effect on the binding of H23.</p>
        <p>To understand H23 mode of inhibition, we performed co-variation experiments by simultaneously varying the concentrations of UDPG at different fixed concentrations of H23 and fitting the kinetic data against the competitive, non-competitive and uncompetitive inhibition equations. For yGsy2p, the inhibition data with H23 was consistent with a competitive mode of inhibition with respect to varied UDPG, with K i values of 370 M in the presence of G6P, and 290 M in the absence of G6P. UDP displayed a similar competitive mode of inhibition with a K i value of 350 M (Figure 4C).To understand H23 mode of inhibition, we performed co-variation experiments by simultaneously varying the concentrations of UDPG at different fixed concentrations of H23 and fitting the kinetic data against the competitive, non-competitive and uncompetitive inhibition equations.

        <p>The overall protein sequence alignment demonstrates 55% sequence identity between yGsy2p and hGYS1. Because the amino acids in the binding site for H23, including Arg320, Phe480, Leu481, Tyr492, and Glu517 in yGsy2p, are completely conserved across yeast and human species (Supplemental Figure 2), the structural information derived from H23-yGsy2p crystal structure provided a useful guide for structure-activity studies focused on hGYS1. We examined a total of 491 analogs that shared at least 50% structural similarity with H23, and we tested their activities against yGsy2p, hGYS1634S8,11N, and wild-type hGYS1 using the 14 C-glucose incorporation assay. Our initial kinetic studies showed that a five-membered, heteroaryl (HA) core with a phenyl group at the A 1 position, and a second, vicinal phenyl group were essential elements of H23 (Table 2). Consequently, analog development modified the HA core, A 1 and substructures at R 1 -R 7 positions shown in the structure in Table 2. In this study, all H23 analogs possessed one of the following HA cores: imidazole (designated as HA 1 ), pyrrole (designated as HA 2 ) or pyrazole (designated as HA 3 ). Active compounds appeared in structures with any of these three cores, but the most potent compounds had a pyrazole (HA 3 ) scaffold. Commercial libraries were the source of HA 1 and HA 2 compounds in Table 2, and a three-step synthesis provided the HA 3 compounds as outlined in Scheme 1. Briefly, starting from the imidazole core (HA 1 ), we determined that the R 1 hydroxyl group that formed a hydrogen bond with the peptide nitrogen of Leu481 was essential to retain good inhibitory activity (i.e., compare H23 versus 1 in Table 2).

        <p>In order to understand the molecular features of our most potent analog, compound 23, we examined the kinetic characteristics of its interaction with GS (Figure 5A). Compound 23 has a competitive mode of inhibition for wild-type hGYS1, with a K i value of 1.31 ± 0.14 µM (Figure 5B). In light of the SAR and our kinetic results, we hypothesized that the binding of 23 to the active site of yGsy2p resembled the binding of H23 in the active site. In this model, the hydroxyl group at R 1 position formed a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen backbone of Leu481. The three hydroxyl groups in the pyrogallol subunit formed hydrogen bonds with Thr514 or Glu517.In order to understand the molecular features of our most potent analog, compound 23, we examined the kinetic characteristics of its interaction with GS (Figure 5A).

        <p>Additional structural flexibility of hydrogen-bond formation depended on the relative position of 23 in the binding pocket. As our SAR study showed, the hydroxyl group at R 5 position was important to confer inhibition, and an additional hydrogen-bond formation between Arg320 and the pyrazole ring may also strengthen binding, particularly when an electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl group was present, and diminish binding when electron-donating methyl group was present in the same position in the pyrazole ring (Figure 5C). To validate whether compound 23 bound within the active site as modelled, we generated mutation within the active site where Y513 was mutated to L513. This mutation, Y513L, did not abolish GS activity.Additional structural flexibility of hydrogen-bond formation depended on the relative position of 23 in the binding pocket.

        <p>We next examined these substituted pyrazoles as inhibitors of GS activity in cell lysates. Cultured cells normally do not accumulate large amounts of glycogen, largely due to the high levels of phosphorylation and the resulting low activity state of GS 26 . Lysates from two cell lines were prepared for GS activity measurement: the HEK293-PTG overexpressing PTG, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1, that recruits the phosphatase to glycogen where it promotes the dephosphorylation and activation of GS 41,42 , and glycogen accumulation; and the Rat-1 fibroblasts which have low GS activity and glycogen as previously described 43,44 PTG cells have a seven-fold increase in the GS activity ratio from 0.02 to 0.15. To determine GS activity in lysates and optimize the conditions for measurement, we measured the incorporation of 14 C-glucose into glycogen at 0.2 mM UDPG and 1 mM G6P initially as a function of different lysate concentrations. We observed a linear increase in GS activity within the range of 0.075-1.5 mg/ml lysate. Under the conditions of the assay, the lysate from the HEK293-PTG cells had 10fold more activity than the Rat-1 cell lysate (Figure 6A). To limit substrate utilization to under 10%, we used 0.15 mg/mL HEK293-PTG lysate and 0.75 mg/mL Rat-1 lysate with imidazole H23, pyrrole 7 and pyrazoles 15, 19, 27 and 23. When tested at 100 μM, H23 and 7 did not significantly inhibit GS activity in lysates. However, the remaining four substituted pyrazoles, namely 15, 19, 27 and 23, reduced synthase activity in both HEK293-PTG and Rat-1 cell lysates by &gt;30%. Consistent with its greatest potency toward purified enzyme, pyrazole 23 exhibited almost complete inhibition of synthase activity in lysates (Figure 6B). In summary, these analogs targeted GS activity in the context of the glycogen particles present in cellular lysates with potencies similar to those observed in purified enzyme preparations.We next examined these substituted pyrazoles as inhibitors of GS activity in cell lysates.

        <p>The suppression of glycogen accumulation emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach for GSDs whose etiology derived from excessive glycogen storage. Animal models supported this approach in which genetic or chemical depletion of glycogen alleviated disease symptoms in models of Lafora disease 27,28,29,30,45 , Pompe disease 31 , and Cori disease 32 . Interestingly, recent studies suggested that type 2 diabetes (T2D) might also be within the GSD spectrum, as glycogen accumulation in pancreatic β cells under hyperglycemia contributed to the pathology of β-cell dysfunction 16,17 .The suppression of glycogen accumulation emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach for GSDs whose etiology derived from excessive glycogen storage.

        <p>Only a few studies identified molecules that targeted glycogen accumulation, including the widely-used glucose lowering T2D drug metformin 46,47 , mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin that indirectly suppress GS activity through signaling regulation 31 , GYS2 RNAi that mediates enzyme reduction 32 , and the newly developed antibody-enzyme fusion that can degrade polyglucosan 45 . However, these molecules either targeted glycogen synthesis in an indirect manner, or present a challenge for the delivery of therapeutics to the central nervous system. In this study, we adapted a high-throughput fluorescence polarization assay to screen directly for small-molecule modulators of GS. A HTS of a commercial 50K chemical library identified 117 primary hits against yGsy2p, and through 14 validated as hGYS1 inhibitor (Figure 2). The low translation between these two assays might lie in the nature of these two systems, since fluorescence polarization assay is affinity-based whereas the radiochemical assay is activity-based. In addition, the kinetic aspects of the two enzyme systems differ as the impact of regulatory input on the enzyme results in different outcomes where regulation of yeast GS by G6P primarily impacts k cat , whereas in mammalian systems the impact is primarily on K m for substrate 48,49 . There is no evidence that the kinetic steps in catalysis differ between the two enzymes, but it is clear that the manner in which the rates for those individual steps are impacted by regulatory input does differ. A more sensitive assay directly targeting hGYS1 is likely to offer better screening outcome. Nonetheless, our FP assay provided a novel HTS assay as a starting point, and did indeed identify a competitive inhibitor of UDPG, namely (rac)-2-methoxy-4-(1-(2-(1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)ethyl)-4-phenyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)phenol (H23), that bound within the active site of yeast yGsy2p. This outcome was supported by both an X-ray structure and by kinetic studies using H23 and analogs developed in a subsequent SAR study. The site of interaction was surprising because the assay identified small-molecule inhibitors that displaced G6P binding. However, a close inspection of the known, eukaryotic GS structures demonstrated that the UDPG and G6P binding sites resided on opposing ends of the same alpha-helix, with Tyr492 stacked against the uracil ring of UDP and His500 forming a hydrogen bond with the phosphate moiety of G6P (Supplemental Figure 3). Considering this structural proximity and the cooperative nature of the structural transitions in GS, it was not surprising that binding at one site could transmit structural information to the other site and that under the subsaturating conditions of our HTS assay, binding of compounds within the active site could promote displacement of the fluorophore from the G6P site. Humans have two isoforms of GS, namely hGYS1 and hGYS2. The fact that hGYS1 is universally expressed in most tissues while hGYS2 is restrictively expressed in liver prompted us to identify inhibitors against hGYS1 in the hope of diminishing brain glycogen stores, aberrantly accumulated in some GSDs such as Lafora disease 26 .

        <p>Mutations in GYS1 50 or GYS2 51 in rare GSDs lead to decreased glycogen in muscle and liver respectively. Disruption of the mouse GYS1 gene resulted in 90% perinatal lethality, likely due to cardiac developmental problems during embryogenesis, but the surviving mice were ostensibly normal and lived normal lifetimes 52 . Disruption of GYS2 in mice largely mimicked the phenotype of human GSD0 patients, namely tendencies to post-prandial hyperglycemia and to hypoglycemia upon fasting but compatible with a relatively normal life 51,53 . Given that smallmolecule inhibition will not have the penetrance of genetic defects, inhibition of GS activity by small-molecules is unlikely to elicit extreme phenotypes, and small-molecule inhibition remains as a potentially valuable means of treating these devastating diseases.Mutations in GYS1 50 or GYS2 51 in rare GSDs lead to decreased glycogen in muscle and liver respectively.

        <p>In summary, this study described a strategy for developing a high-throughput FP assay for the screening of small-molecule inhibitors of GS, the binding mode of a leading imidazole H23 validated through both X-ray crystallographic and kinetic data; and an SAR study leading to analogs, such as pyrazole 23, with low micromolar potency. These outcomes suggest that targeting glycogen synthase with small-molecule inhibitors represents an attractive approach for developing new therapeutics for diseases in the GSD family. Unlike other enzyme-based strategies where complete inhibition is the ultimate objective, a partial reduction of GS activity may be sufficient to alleviate unwanted and damaging levels of glycogen deposition in the neural tissue of patients suffering from Lafora disease 27,28,30 . The challenges of developing any therapeutic, nevertheless, remain the same, and the gulf that stretches between our identification of a pyrazole inhibitor 23 with activity in the low micromolar range and a therapeutic candidate is wide and deep. Initial efforts will involve microsomal studies to evaluate anticipated pharmacokinetic concerns about unwanted redox reactions of pyrazole 23 to 4-(4H-pyrazol-4ylidene)-or 2,3-dihydroxy-4-(3H-pyrazol-3-ylidene)cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ones. We will use a combination of synthesis (i.e., SAR studies) and computational modeling to identify analogs that avoid this concern and retain desired physiochemical properties (i.e., water solubility; bioavailability); we will evaluate any promising, new leading structures for potential toxicity issues (e.g., hERG studies); and we will explore biotinylated analogs to confirm the specificity of these pyrazole analogs for the desired target.

        <p>Analyses of protein expression, GS activity ratio in the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of UDPG (4.4 mM) and of G6P (7.2 mM) and glycogen levels indicated that the protein was expressed, the GS activity ratio was increased 7-fold, from 0.02 in control cells to 0.15 in transfected cells, and that glycogen was increased by 90-fold. Quantitation of the expression of PTG is difficult because the basal levels are very low, undetectable under our conditions.Analyses of protein expression, GS activity ratio in the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of UDPG (4.4 mM) and of G6P (7.2 mM) and glycogen levels indicated that the protein was expressed, the GS activity ratio was increased 7-fold, from 0.02 in control cells to 0.15 in transfected cells, and that glycogen was increased by 90-fold.

        <p>For lysate preparation the HEK293-PTG cells were cultured in 100 mm plate with 5.5 mM αMEM, 10% FBS, 6 μg/mL penicillin, 10 μg/mL streptomycin, and 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin. Rat-1 cells were cultured in 100 mm plate with 25 mM DMEM, 10% FBS, 6 μg/mL penicillin and 10 μg/mL streptomycin. Cells were grown for 3-4 days till confluency. Before harvest, cells were washed twice with 5 mL ice-cold GS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 20 mM EDTA, 25 mM KF). Then 400 μL GS homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaF) with protease inhibitor (0.1 mM TLCK, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 ) and β-mercaptoethanol (0.4%) plus Triton 100 × (0.2%) were added to each 100 mm plate. Plates were frozen on liquid N 2 and scraped. Then lysates were transferred to 2 ml Eppendorf tube, sonicated for 15 seconds twice on ice, and placed on nutator for 10 minutes at 4 ºC. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford reagent and indicated that the protein concentration was the same in both lysates. GS activity was initially measured with varying concentration of the lysates. For monitoring the effect of small-molecules on GS, HEK293-PTG cell lysates were diluted 10-fold while Rat-1 cell lysates were diluted 2-fold in homogenization buffer to achieve steady-state kinetics under the conditions we used in 14 C-glucose incorporation assay 33 . GS activity in cell lysates was measured in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.8 with 6.7 mg/ml glycogen, and subsaturating concentrations of UDPG (0.2 mM) and G6P (1 mM) in the absence or presence of 100 μM H23 and its analogs.For lysate preparation the HEK293-PTG cells were cultured in 100 mm plate with 5.5 mM αMEM, 10% FBS, 6 μg/mL penicillin, 10 μg/mL streptomycin, and 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin.

        <p>All the fluorescence polarization (FP) experiments were performed on an EnVision multimode plate reader (Perkin Elmer) with the λ ex = 485 nm and λ em = 535 nm. The FP experiments were performed in 384-well, black, flat bottom microplates at 25ºC. After addition of all reagents, plates were spun down for a minute at 1000g in a centrifuge followed by measurement of the FP harboring the yeast Gsy2p cDNA 49 using forward primer 5′-CTACGAGCCTTGGGGTCTCACACCTGCAGAATGTAC-3′ and its complement primer, and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant protein was purified exactly the same way as was yGsy2p. However, the yield was significantly less compared to WT protein. Additionally, the activity of Y513L mutant is around 10-fold lower than WT enzyme. Kinetics experiments with Y513 mutant were performed under saturating G6P concentration (7.2 mM).All the fluorescence polarization (FP) experiments were performed on an EnVision multimode plate reader (Perkin Elmer) with the λ ex = 485 nm and λ em = 535 nm.
