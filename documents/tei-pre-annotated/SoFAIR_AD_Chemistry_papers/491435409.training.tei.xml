        <p>The global pigments and dyes market was valuated at 33.2 billion American dollars in 2019 [1]. Manufactures of dyes and pigments are concerned about the toxicity of these dyes, and they are actively venturing into enhancing the methods for removing dyes freed to the environment during the manufacturing process [1][2][3]. There is a current increasing demand for dyes for diverse industries such as textile, paints and coatings, plastics, constructions [1]. Besides the production of dyes and pigments, several industries are also responsible for considerable amounts of dyes released to the environment [1], which them the textile industry is the primary industrial sector that consumes about 2 3 ⁄ of all dyes that are commercialized worldwide [1].The global pigments and dyes market was valuated at 33.2 billion American dollars in 2019 [1].

        <p>Considering all dyes and pigments sold in 2019 [1], the Reactive Dyes has a share of 55.7% [1]. This dyes class comprises highly colored organic compounds that have primary application in tinting textiles [1]. Reactive dyes can form a covalent bond with the cotton fiber [1,4], giving them the feature of having difficulty fading and a bright shade ranges [1,4]. Although reactive dyes are primarily employed for dying textiles, 15-50% of them are left hydrolyzed in the waterbaths during the dying process [5]. Therefore, high volumes of wastewater containing reactive dyes are generated, and they require further treatment before being liberated to water bodies [2,3,[6][7][8].Considering all dyes and pigments sold in 2019 [1], the Reactive Dyes has a share of 55.7% [1].

        <p>The removal of dyes from the aqueous environment is imperative because they are toxic and can cause carcinogenicity and mutagenicity [10][11][12][13]. Wastewater containing dyes are usually treated by biodegradation [14,15], coagulation-flocculation [15], the advanced oxidative process [16], and adsorption [17][18][19][20][21].The removal of dyes from the aqueous environment is imperative because they are toxic and can cause carcinogenicity and mutagenicity [10][11][12][13].

        <p>Lignocellulosic wastes have been reported as adsorbents for removing dyes from wastewaters [3,26]. Although their spread is used as biosorbents, the adsorption capacities of agricultural residues are low compared with other adsorbents [6,7,24,25] because of their low surface area and the difficulty of being used in the column due to low mechanical resistance [6,7,24,25]. The chemical modification of biomass-forming hybrids and composites is a good alternative for producing adsorbents with higher adsorption capacities over unmodified lignocellulosic materials [6,7,24,25].Lignocellulosic wastes have been reported as adsorbents for removing dyes from wastewaters [3,26].

        <p>In the present research, we proposed the chemical modification of sawdust of Ayous wood with APTES. Preliminary experiments showed that AW@APTES-0.5 is the best adsorbent for the removal of RB-4 dye from aqueous effluents. This work aimed to show that AW@APTES-0.5 material increased the maximum sorption capacity of AW biomass up to 21.6 times. This remarkable characteristic allows that the proposed adsorbent would be able to be used in actual wastewater treatments. Besides that, the procedure for preparing the hybrid material was carried out in a single step, being an advantage when compared with adsorbents that require multiple steps for being obtained [37,38]. This research allies the need to remove reactive dyes from aqueous effluents, with a hybrid biomass-based material prepared in a single step, obtaining excellent removals from wastewater containing a complex sample matrix.In the present research, we proposed the chemical modification of sawdust of Ayous wood with APTES.

This loss of sorption capacity could be assigned to the formation of oligomers of APTES that did not react with OH groups present on the lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose groups of the AW biomass [58].</p>
        <p>The experiments were performed initially in pH 2.0 because, in earlier works where APTES grafted on different materials [7,17,27], the amino group is protonated, forming an ammonium group positively charged that attracts the anionic RB-4 dye [7,17,27]. This behavior is one of the achievements of using APTES grafted materials for adsorbing dyes [7,17,27] concerning unmodified AW sawdust.The experiments were performed initially in pH 2.0 because, in earlier works where APTES grafted on different materials [7,17,27], the amino group is protonated, forming an ammonium group positively charged that attracts the anionic RB-4 dye [7,17,27].

However, one of the reasons for the hybrid adsorbent present higher kid can also be attributed to the higher sorption capacity of AW@APTES-0.5 adsorbent compared to AW (unmodified biomass).</p>

        <p>According to the results presented in Table S5, the Liu isotherm model was better fitted by the isotherm data at temperatures ranging from 10° to 50°C, because of the lowest SD and BIC and R²adj closer to 1 were obtained for this isotherm model. The BIC between Langmuir and Liu ranged from 50.23 to 55.63 for temperatures 10°-40°C and 3.390 at 50°C, using the hybrid adsorbent, and 52.85 to 104.3 for 10° to 50°C using AW biomass [54]. Although just for one temperature and one case, the BIC (BICLangmuir -BICLiu) was not conclusive; however, there is a perspective that the Liu model would be the better isotherm model to be fitted at 50°C concerning Langmuir isotherm, using the hybrid adsorbent [54]. For all BIC 10 it is conclusive that the Liu model was the best-fitted model. The BICFreudlich -BICLiu ranged from 62.19 to 123.5 (AW@APTES-0.5) and 90.06-124.7 (AW) for temperature from 10° to 50°C.According to the results presented in Table S5, the Liu isotherm model was better fitted by the isotherm data at temperatures ranging from 10° to 50°C, because of the lowest SD and BIC and R²adj closer to 1 were obtained for this isotherm model.

        <p>Considering the values of Qmax obtained by the Liu isotherm for both adsorbents, it is observed that AW@APTES-0.5 presented values 8.8-21.6 times higher than AW. This considerable increase in the adsorption capacity is due to the possible formation of AW@APTES-0.5 depicted in Fig 1 . The insertion of amino groups on the hybrid material leads to positively charged ammonium groups when the adsorbent is immersed in a solution with pH 2.0, facts that allow attracting the anionic RB-4 dye electrostatically.Considering the values of Qmax obtained by the Liu isotherm for both adsorbents, it is observed that AW@APTES-0.5 presented values 8.8-21.6 times higher than AW.

Also, the magnitude of enthalpy changes is compatible with physical adsorption [59,60]. For both cases, the S° were also positive, indicating that the sorbing specie should have lost hydration water before occupying the adsorbent's active site [46,47].As can be seen, the result of thermodynamic of adsorption for the adsorption of RB-4 dye onto two adsorbents, the process of adsorption was spontaneous within the range of temperatures used (283-323 K), where the value of G Ꝋ &lt; 0, the values of H Ꝋ &gt; 0, pointing that the process of adsorption was endothermic in both cases (see Fig S6) [57].

        <p>Considering the data of the surface area, pore size distribution, HI, pHpzc of the adsorbents, the chemical nature of the adsorbents, the studies of initial pH of the sorbing solution, the study of kinetics, and the thermodynamic results for adsorption of the anionic RB-4 dye onto AW@APTES-0.5 and AW, it is possible to state that the mechanism of interaction of the adsorbent with the adsorbate is an electrostatic attraction of the anionic RB-4 dye onto the protonated amino groups of the adsorbent at pH 2.0 (see Fig 7).Considering the data of the surface area, pore size distribution, HI, pHpzc of the adsorbents, the chemical nature of the adsorbents, the studies of initial pH of the sorbing solution, the study of kinetics, and the thermodynamic results for adsorption of the anionic RB-4 dye onto AW@APTES-0.5 and AW, it is possible to state that the mechanism of interaction of the adsorbent with the adsorbate is an electrostatic attraction of the anionic RB-4 dye onto the protonated amino groups of the adsorbent at pH 2.0 (see Fig 7).</p>
        <p>The probable mechanism of interaction of the adsorbent with the adsorbate should take place in two steps. In the first step, the amino groups at pH 2.0 are protonated, forming positively charged ammonium specie. The RB-4 anionic dye is electrostatically attracted by the ammonium group (positively charged) at the second stage, forming an ion pair. This interaction mechanism should be the primary mechanism of adsorption, disregarding the transport phenomena. Other less significant mechanisms are hydrogen-bonding, - interaction of RB-4 rings with AW's aromatics, van der Waals interactions [43,47]. The mechanism of pore-filling should be disregarded, considering the low surface area of both adsorbents. In the AW material, where there are no 3-aminopropyl groups, the interaction mechanism is limited to hydrogenbonding, - interaction of RB-4 rings with AW's aromatics, van der Waals interactions [43,47], and electrostatic attraction. For the AW material, the mechanism is still the electrostatic attraction; however, there is no amino group presence as in the hybrid material, limiting the sorption capacity compared to AW@APTES-0.5.The probable mechanism of interaction of the adsorbent with the adsorbate should take place in two steps.

        <p>In order to compare the differences in performance of AW@APTES-0.5, the unmodified biomass (AW) was used. Nitrogen isotherms of adsorption and desorption characterized both AW@APTES-0.50 and AW, and the results showed that both materials have low surface areas and poor porosities. This result indicated that the mechanism of pore filling should be disregarded. Using TGA (10.73%) and C H N elemental analysis (N analysis 9.57%), it was possible to estimate the percentage of APTES grafted on AW material. The probable grafting of APTES on sawdust (see Fig 1) increased the hydrophilicity feature of AW@APTES-0.50 compared to AW and also shifted the pHpzc from 6.051 (AW) to 10.37 (AW@APTES-0.50), which confer a basic characteristic to the hybrid material. Studies of the effect of the initial pH of RB-4 on the adsorption capacity of both adsorbents showed that pH 2.0 is the best acidity to obtain the maximum removal of the dye using both adsorbents. The adsorption kinetics data were better fitted to the nonlinear general order kinetic model (GO), and the equilibrium data obtained at temperatures ranging from 10° to 50°C showed that the nonlinear Liu isotherm model represented better the equilibrium of adsorption. The thermodynamics of adsorption showed that the process of adsorption was favorable (G°&lt;0), endothermic (H° &gt;0), and the magnitude of enthalpy changes is compatible with physical adsorption. Based on all the results obtained in this work, a mechanism of adsorption where the main contribution is the electrostatic attraction of the anionic dye with the positively charged adsorbent at pH 2.0 should take place.
