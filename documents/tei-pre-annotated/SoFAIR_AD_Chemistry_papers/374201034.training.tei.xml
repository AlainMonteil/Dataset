        <p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) data, approximately 1.3 billion tones of food (roughly one-third of total food produced for human comsuption) is wasted globally throughout the food supply chain (FSC) from initial agricultural production down to final household consumption or food manufacturing industries (Gustavsson et al., 2011). At the same time, the development of biorefineries is imperative in order to meet urgent environmental targets such as the UK's commitment to zero carbon by 2050. The need to both avoid waste and find new renewable resources to replace fossil fuels has led to a new and promising research avenue: the use of food supply chain waste (FSCW) as a renewable biorefinery feedstock (Pfaltzgraff et al., 2013). To become viable, the efficiency and flexibility of biorefineries must be maximised to cater for the inherently wider range of feedstocks and products compared with oil refineries, and microwave technology can play a major role in achieving this due to the potential for process intensification afforded by the microwave heating mechanisms alongside their ability to be powered by carbon-free electrical energy rather than traditional fossil fuel heat sources. However, step changes in the approach to the design of microwave processes are required to make this a reality. This is due to the fundamental differences in the way microwaves heat materials compared with conventional heating; microwaves cannot simply be ''dropped in" to replace conventional heat sources. Bespoke systems must be designed based on an understanding of microwave-material interactions and the role they play in processing. Microwave-Assisted (Solvent) Extraction (MAE) is promising as a biorefinery unit operation to extract high value chemicals from biomass prior to downstream processing of the solid residues. However, fundamental and systematic understanding of how the microwave heating mechanisms drive mass transfer during MAE is lacking. In this paper, we have used the extraction of pectin from food wastes (specifically food industry co-products) as a case study to address the abovementioned knowledge gaps in solvent extraction. We have investigated experimentally, for the first time, how heat transfer resulting from microwave heating can drive mass transfer in biomass-solvent systems, and the role of the heat tranfer properties of the biomass in this process.According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) data, approximately 1.3 billion tones of food (roughly one-third of total food produced for human comsuption) is wasted globally throughout the food supply chain (FSC) from initial agricultural production down to final household consumption or food manufacturing industries (Gustavsson et al., 2011).

        <p>Pectin extraction was selected as a relevant case study because although commercial pectin (rich in ''smooth" pectin, homogalacturonan (HG)) is already extracted industrially using hot acid extraction, there is no existing industrial process to extract ''hairy" pectin, which is rich in rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I). The development of commercially viable ''hairy" pectin extraction processes is key to the development of novel RG-I derived products (Arrutia et al., 2020), which have a wide range of potential applications, for example as a potential source of a new class of prebiotics (Babbar et al., 2016). The growth of the pectin market is driven by the rising demand for functional food products and increasing use by the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. In 2015, the average price of pectin exceeded $15/kg and the market exceeded 60,000 tons, with 6% of overall annual growth rate reported (Monitor, 2015). Orange peel, mango peel, apple pomace and carrot pulp were selected as industrially relevant co-products with relatively high pectin contents (Table 1).Pectin extraction was selected as a relevant case study because although commercial pectin (rich in ''smooth" pectin, homogalacturonan (HG)) is already extracted industrially using hot acid extraction, there is no existing industrial process to extract ''hairy" pectin, which is rich in rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I).

        <p>MAE is a novel extraction process that is widely reported to accelerate or enhance the solvent extraction of pectin compared to CSE (Adetunji et al., 2017), achieved through volumetric and selective microwave heating mechanisms. Microwaves can penetrate throughout the whole volume of material (Li et al., 2013), which makes it possible to achieve rapid volumetric heating with associated extraction time savings and reduced bio-active extract degradation (Venkatesh and Raghavan, 2004). Selective heating can heat different components in a heterogeneous system at different rates, and it is thought that this can lead to rupture of cells within biomass, resulting in higher extraction yields and the ability to treat recalcitrant materials (Adetunji et al., 2017;Chemat et al., 2009). Despite these reported advantages, to our knowledge MAE of pectin has not been applied at an industrial scale, with only two pilot scale examples in the literature. Garcia-Garcia et al. (2019) treated 3 kg of orange peel in water in a 20L recirculating batch for 1.5 h at 95 °C using a 6 kW microwave power source, yielding 150 g orange peel pectin. Arrutia et al. (2020) developed a semi-continuous MAE process that could treat 250 mL min À1 of 10% w/w potato pulp in water using a 2 kW single mode cavity followed by 20 mins mass transfer time with no heating. Yields in both cases were higher than reported values for batch CSE systems; however, neither were compared under like-for-like operating conditions, so the mechanism by which microwave heating provided advantages could not be assessed.MAE is a novel extraction process that is widely reported to accelerate or enhance the solvent extraction of pectin compared to CSE (Adetunji et al., 2017), achieved through volumetric and selective microwave heating mechanisms.

        <p>One small batch-scale study has compared CSE (90 °C water bath) and MAE (maximum applied power 200 W) for pectin extraction from micronised sugar beet pulp using the same processing conditions (including vessel geometry, heating rate and stirring regime), and shown no difference in yield, optimum extraction time or quality of the pectin extracted (Mao et al., 2019). The only other published studies comparing MAE and CSE using the same heating rate are on the extraction of polyphenols from sea buckthorn leaves (Asofiei et al., 2016;Galan et al., 2017). In that case, a higher yield was achieved for microwave heating, while the extraction time was the same for both heating methods. By using the same heating rate (and therefore decoupling the advantages of the faster heating rates that are often achieved using microwave volumetric heating), the studies were able to investigate the effect of microwave selective heating, demonstrating no difference in the case of pectin extraction from sugar beet pulp on one hand, and increased yield in the case of polyphenol extraction from sea buckthorn leaves on the other. Based on these results, we hypothesise that the mass transfer processes during extraction can be enhanced during microwave heating, but only under certain processing conditions and for certain biomasses and/or target extracts. If true, we aim to understand the specific mass transfer processes that can be enhanced by microwave heating, and how they are affected by the heat transfer properties of the biomass feedstock.One small batch-scale study has compared CSE (90 °C water bath) and MAE (maximum applied power 200 W) for pectin extraction from micronised sugar beet pulp using the same processing conditions (including vessel geometry, heating rate and stirring regime), and shown no difference in yield, optimum extraction time or quality of the pectin extracted (Mao et al., 2019).

        <p>Pectin isolation is conceptualised as a series of mass transfer steps (illustrated in Fig. 1): (i) penetration of solvent at the surface of the solid, (ii) diffusion through the solid, (iii) hydrolysis of the proto-pectin (i.e. the in situ pectic polysaccharide, bound to other cell wall compounds like cellulose), (iv) solubilisation of pectin into the solvent, (v) diffusion to the solid surface, (vi) external transfer to the bulk solution, and (vii) degradation and de-esterification of the extracted pectin (Adetunji et al., 2017;Flórez et al., 2015;Pinelo et al., 2006). Andersen et al. (2017) built a dynamic model of pectin extraction. The model was validated using conventional solvent extraction of lime peel, and the authors concluded that extractions under the conditions investigated appear to be controlled by the transport phenomena, as the hydrolysis (and solubilisation) of proto-pectin was predicted to be fast in relation to the diffusion inside the peel, and this conclusion is in agreement with most publications. We aim with this work to extend this understanding by interrogating the effect of heat transfer on the aforementioned mass transfer processes in the cases of electromagnetic and conventional heating, and in particular to investigate the effects of differing heat transfer properties of the biomasses themselves under different heating regimes, which has to date been overlooked in the literature. The overall temperature (T bulk ) of the system and the solvent type are known to have significant effects on the mass transfer processes. However, in this study we have removed those two parameters as variables in order to focus specifically on the effects of the different local temperature (T local ) distributions within the biomass that could be generated using different heating methods and in different biomasses. In the case of CSE, T local will be lower than T bulk until steady state is achieved, at which point the system will be isothermal. In the case of microwave heating, volumetric and selective heating could lead to T local being higher than T bulk even after steady state is achieved, with the highest temperatures expected in the centre of the particle (Taqi et al., 2020).Pectin isolation is conceptualised as a series of mass transfer steps (illustrated in Fig. 1): (i) penetration of solvent at the surface of the solid, (ii) diffusion through the solid, (iii) hydrolysis of the proto-pectin (i.e. the in situ pectic polysaccharide, bound to other cell wall compounds like cellulose), (iv) solubilisation of pectin into the solvent, (v) diffusion to the solid surface, (vi) external transfer to the bulk solution, and (vii) degradation and de-esterification of the extracted pectin (Adetunji et al., 2017;Flórez et al., 2015;Pinelo et al., 2006).

        <p>Fig. 1 highlights the extraction steps that could be influenced by the elevation of T local above T bulk during microwave heating. Compared with the isothermal CSE system at steady state, the rates of diffusion (ii and v) and hydrolysis (step iii) would increase with increasing T local , reducing extraction time. The solubility of pectin is known to be highly temperature dependent (Sila et al., 2009), which means that increased T local could lead to increased pectin yield and/or faster solubilisation at step (iv). Microwave heating could have a positive or negative effect on step vi (pectin degrada-tion): elevated T local could lead to faster degradation of the pectin once solubilised within the biomas, while reduced extraction time facilitated through speeding up the other steps could lead to reduced time for degradation to take place. The abovementioned changes would be expected to be incremental, as the temperature differences under normal operating conditions are predicted to be in the order a few degrees only (Lee et al., 2016;Taqi et al., 2020).Fig. 1 highlights the extraction steps that could be influenced by the elevation of T local above T bulk during microwave heating.

        <p>Microwave heating could also enhance mass transfer through Temperature-Induced Diffusion (TID), in which transport processes are driven by temperature gradients in addition to concentration gradients (Lee et al., 2016;Taqi et al., 2020). This can be understood by considering the chemical potential, which is a universal property that dictates the direction and magnitude of the driving force for mass transfer. The chemical potential of component i (l i , J mol À1 ) in a mixture at given temperature and pressure, and with fixed activity of component i (which is analagous to concentration in non-ideal systems), is given below, which was derived by Robinson et al.

In an isothermal system (such as conventional solvent extraction), T is equal to the baseline temperature T 0 , the temperature term disappears, and the chemical potential becomes analagous to the classical osmostic pressure expression. The inclusion of the temperature-dependent term (which is required in microwave heating) leads to an increase in chemical potential gradients within the biomass, drawing additional water into the cellular structure. This could affect the diffusion rates in steps (ii) and (v), which, as stated above, are likely the rate limiting steps in extraction. It could also theoretically lead to the generation of high enough cellular pressures to disrupt or even rupture the cell walls, leading to increased yields of previously inaccessible protopectin and a step change reduction in extraction time.

        <p>During CSE, heat is transferred into the solvent from the heating bath by conduction, and therefore the conductivity of the solvent/solute may affect the heating rate of the solvent and hence T bulk . By stirring the solvent-biomass systems, the effect of convection or conduction within the solvent is eliminated and it can therefore be assumed that T bulk is isothermal and the same as the set temperature in all experiments. However, the conductivity of the biomass will affect T local in both CSE and MAE. For CSE, a higher conductivity will lead to a faster equilibration of T local with T bulk . For MAE, any selective heating effects are expected to be enhanced for lower thermal conductivities, as conductive heat transfer from the momentarily hotter phase to the surroundings will be slower. Steady state, however, will not be affected, just the time to steady state.During CSE, heat is transferred into the solvent from the heating bath by conduction, and therefore the conductivity of the solvent/solute may affect the heating rate of the solvent and hence T bulk .

CSE was either carried out by adding the extraction vessel to a water bath preheated to 90 °C for the duration of the experiment, or by adding the extraction vessel to an ethylene glycol bath preheated to 120 °C and 150 °C, and transferred to a 90 °C water bath once the set temperature was reached. In doing so, the effect of heating rate on CSE was investigated for the first time. MAE was carried out using a Miniflow 200SS (Sairem, France) single mode microwave heating system at 2.45 GHz, with a fibre optic temperature probe inserted into the reaction vessel. The heating rates of MAE were manipulated by changing the maximum incident power at 200 W, 150 W, 120 W, 100 W and 50 W. The reflected power was adjusted to zero before the treatment, so that the absorbed power can be as close as the incident power.

        <p>Biomass samples were prepared in D.I. water solution at the same sample size and S/L ratio as used in the extraction experiments. This method measures the bulk properties of the system, and therefore indicates the general propensity of the system for volumetric heating. Although it doesn't measure the actual dielectric loss of the biomasses during extraction, the difference between this value and that of the solvent will give a relative indication of the degree of selective heating of the biomass in the system. The mixtures were heated using a hot plate from 20 °C to 90 °C with measurements taken at 10 °C intervals. Dielectric property measurements were performed using an 85070E Dielectric Probe Kit (Agilent, USA).

        <p>To determine whether and how the biomass type affects temperature development during heating, the heating rates during extraction were measured. The heating rates of using only D.I water under microwave and conventional heating were also measured. The results are shown in Fig. 2A for MAE at 200 W, and in Fig. 2B for CSE heated using the 90 °C water bath. The heating rates were affected by the biomass type, with the apple pomace ! orange peel &gt; mango peel &gt; carrot pulp ! D.I water for MAE. Conversely for CSE, the heating rates in descending order were D.I water ! carrot pulp ) orange peel &gt; mango peel &gt; apple pomace. The heating rates were consistently higher for MAE at 200 W than CSE heated using a 90 °C water bath. However, the values for MAE for orange peel, mango peel and apple pomace are significantly higher (e.g. 39.4 °C/mins compared with 16.5 °C/min for orange peel), while only incremental for carrot pulp and (34.6 °C/min versus 28.4 °C/ min). This indicates that the biomass types does affect heating rates, and the reason for this behaviour will be discussed in the next Section 4.1.2. Additionally, the effect of biomass type on heating rates is larger for CSE (±17.3 °C min) compared with MAE (±6. 0 °C/min). This indicates that the heating rate of a scaled-up microwave process should be less sensitive to changes in biomass type, which is favourable for scale-up.To determine whether and how the biomass type affects temperature development during heating, the heating rates during extraction were measured.

        <p>To relate the differing heating rates to the heat transfer properties, the thermal conductivities (k) and dielectric losses (e 0 0 Þ of the biomass -solvent systems, were investigated. The thermal conductivity of solute pipetted from the biomasssolvent system at 20 °C are shown in Fig. 3. The thermal conductivity of D.I water was 0.624 W/m K and that of the biomass solutes at 20 °C were all lower than water, indicating a general reduction in conductivity of the system during extraction to a greater (apple of 0.418 W/m K) or lesser (other biomasses, for example carrot of 0.612 W/mK) extent. This concurs with the CSE heating rates shown in Fig. 2B, showing that the conductivity of the solute correlates with the heating rates of the system (explaining why the carrot pulp heated more than twice as quickly as the apple pomace but had simiar heating rate as D.I water itself) and confirming the hypothesis that conductivity can be used as a predictor of bulk heating rate during conventional heating.To relate the differing heating rates to the heat transfer properties, the thermal conductivities (k) and dielectric losses (e 0 0 Þ of the biomass -solvent systems, were investigated.

        <p>To understand the microwave heating rates, the dielectric loss (e 0 0 Þof water and biomass -water systems were measured and are shown in Fig. 4. All biomass -water systems had higher dielectric losses than those of pure water. This explains the results in Fig. 2A andB: while the addition of biomass to the water reduced the thermal conductivity, slowing down conventional heating, it increased dielectric loss, accelerating microwave volumetric heat-ing. Therefore the fastest microwave heater (apple, e 00 =13.4 at 90 °C) was the slowest conventional heater, with the opposite true for carrot (e 0 0 = 4.7 at 90 °C).To understand the microwave heating rates, the dielectric loss (e 0 0 Þof water and biomass -water systems were measured and are shown in Fig. 4.

The unidentified components were most likely protein and ash (Mao et al., 2020). Given that the heating rate and extraction time as well as the heating method were different in these experiments, it is difficult to propose a reason for this discrepancy, which is investigated further in Section 4.2. In the case of carrot pulp, near identical quantities of HG, RG-I, other sugars (xylose and glucose, which are main components of hemicellulose) and unidentified components were extracted using MAE and CSE, and this was is expected based on the similar heating rates achieved between MAE and CSE for carrot and the lack of selective heating as indicated by the dielectric loss in Fig. 4 (as discussed in Section 4.1.2).

        <p>We can conclude from this section, therefore, that the biomass types does affect the performance of microwave and conventional solvent extraction. Because heating rate in conventional heating is driven by conductivity, and in microwave heating is driven by dielectric loss, and because the presence of extract has a positive effect on dielectric loss and a negative effect on thermal conductivity, a good candidate for MAE is by nature a bad candidate for CSE, and vice versa. This result is a major breakthrough in understanding the huge variation in experimental outcomes of MAE reported in the literature, and a major step forward in terms of enabling the selection of microwave technology where it will offer best advantage.We can conclude from this section, therefore, that the biomass types does affect the performance of microwave and conventional solvent extraction.

        <p>The second research question relates specifically to the mechanisms by which microwave heating leads to processing advantages in order to be able to predict favourable processing conditions. If the accelerated extraction observed during MAE of the fruits is a result of the faster heating rates caused by volumetric heating, then in theory conductive heating in CSE could lead to the same results if the heating rate of the microwave heating is matched by the conventional experiments. If selective heating plays a role, then there should still be a difference between MAE and CSE even when the same heating rates are applied, and this could impact on the extraction performance in the ways depicted in Fig. 1.The second research question relates specifically to the mechanisms by which microwave heating leads to processing advantages in order to be able to predict favourable processing conditions.

        <p>To decouple the effects of heating rate (either by volumetric or conductive heating) and selective heating, heating rate was investigated as an independent variable for orange peel pectin extraction. This was done by varying the microwave input power for MAE (50-200 W), and by using liquid baths of difference temperatures for CSE (90-150 °C) and transferring the reactor to a 90 °C water bath once the set T bulk was reached. The bulk heating rates achieved using these methods are shown in Fig. 7, with the average heating rates calculated between 25 °C and 90 °C tabulated below each figure. It shows shows that the heating rate increases with increasing applied power for MAE and liquid bath temperature for CSE. MAE at 200 W achieved a similar heating rate to CSE using a 150 °C liqud bath (39.4 °C/min compared with 38.9 °C/min), while MAE at 100 W was close to CSE using a 90 °C bath (17.6 °C/min compared with 16.5 °C/min) and MAE at 120 °C was comparable with the 120 °C bath (25.5 °C/min and 23.6 °C/ min). This enables investigation of the performance of MAE and CSE at difference heating rates (and therefore microwave powers) for the first time.To decouple the effects of heating rate (either by volumetric or conductive heating) and selective heating, heating rate was investigated as an independent variable for orange peel pectin extraction.

The bulk heating rates achieved using these methods are shown in Fig. 7, with the average heating rates calculated between 25 °C and 90 °C tabulated below each figure. It shows shows that the heating rate increases with increasing applied power for MAE and liquid bath temperature for CSE. MAE at 200 W achieved a similar heating rate to CSE using a 150 °C liqud bath (39.4 °C/min compared with 38.9 °C/min), while MAE at 100 W was close to CSE using a 90 °C bath (17.6 °C/min compared with 16.5 °C/min) and MAE at 120 °C was comparable with the 120 °C bath (25.5 °C/min and 23.6 °C/ min). This enables investigation of the performance of MAE and CSE at difference heating rates (and therefore microwave powers) for the first time.</p>
        <p>Fig. 8A shows the AIS yield as a function of extraction time for both CSE and MAE at various heating rates, and Fig. 8B shows the optimal yield as a function of heating rate. Considering the CSE results first, it is clear that the AIS yield increases slightly with heating rate (11.1-12.5%), but that the extraction time appears unaffected, at 120 mins. At the lower microwave powers of 50 and 100 W, the results are similar: increased heating rate increases yield but not extraction time, and comparing MAE at 100 W with CSE and 90 °C water bath, which have very similar bulk heating rates of 17.6 and 16.5 °C/min, the extraction yields and times are very similar. At low heating powers therefore, there is no evidence of a selective heating advantage. It is also important to note that there is fairly low resolution in the data regarding treatment time, especially around 120 mins. Therefore, slight differences in the optimum extraction time cannot be identified.Fig. 8A shows the AIS yield as a function of extraction time for both CSE and MAE at various heating rates, and Fig. 8B shows the optimal yield as a function of heating rate.

        <p>The MAE results at higher powers show a different trend. Fig. 8A shows that increasing the power from 100 W to 120 W results in a step change reduction in optimum extraction time, from 120 mins to 60 mins. The yields in Fig. 8B andC show a similar incremental increase in optimum extraction yield with increasing heating rate to CSE, except one anomaly 150 W, where it is slightly lower than at 120 W and 200 W (10.5% compared with 12.5 and 12.9%). This is likely due to the lack of resolution in the data coupled with the fact that after the optimum extraction time, the AIS degrades rapidly in the solvent by b-elimination to a molecular weight level too small to be precipitated in alcohol (Fraeye et al., 2007). This degradation is more pronounced in the higher-powered microwave experiments, possibly linked to the selective heating effects causing higher T local temperatures. Therefore, the optimal yield at 150 W was probably closer to 12 -13% somewhere between 45 and 60 mins. It is noted though that all differences in yields are incremental, likely because the maximum AIS yield with water as the solvent has been achieved (the effect of solvent is known to have a marked effect on extraction yield and composition (Mao et al., 2019), but is not within the scope of this study).The MAE results at higher powers show a different trend.

        <p>Fig. 9 shows the sugar analysis of the AIS extracted at comparable heating rates for MAE and CSE: ~17 °C/min (MAE at 100 W, 90 °C liquid bath), ~25 °C/min (150 W, 120 °C bath) and ~39 °C/ min (200 W, 150 °C bath). It shows, broadly speaking, that the amount of HG and RG-I extracted are similar in all cases. There is a slight decrease in the HG at higher heating rates for CSE, and this could be caused by longer treatment times allowing more time for Fig. 8. AIS yields against time (A) and against heating rates (B, C) of MAE and CSE at different heating ''powers" using orange peel.Fig. 9 shows the sugar analysis of the AIS extracted at comparable heating rates for MAE and CSE: ~17 °C/min (MAE at 100 W, 90 °C liquid bath), ~25 °C/min (150 W, 120 °C bath) and ~39 °C/ min (200 W, 150 °C bath).

        <p>The interesting finding is that the target extract polysaccharides (pectin with some hemicellulose) were expected to predominantly break down into sugar monomers (detected in this analysis). As expected at low heating rates, the total sugar contents in the extracts constituted &gt;900 mg/g AIS. At heating rates above ~20 °C/min, however, the sugar content did not increase in line with the increase in total AIS yield shown in Fig. 8B andC. The increases in yields observed at higher powers were not due to sugars, and were therefore not the result of increased polysaccharide extraction (pectin and hemicelluclose), but something else not detected in the sugar analysis (most likely protein and ash). This was the case in both CSE and MAE extraction, and it is therefore concluded that this unidentified components are extracted at higher heating rates, and is not related to any microwave selective heating effects.The interesting finding is that the target extract polysaccharides (pectin with some hemicellulose) were expected to predominantly break down into sugar monomers (detected in this analysis).

        <p>The important and novel finding of the experiments in this section is that a microwave power input threshold has been identified. Below the threshold, heating rate has very little effect on results (high heating rates may also lead to the extraction of small amounts of proteins and/or other cell wall components (Mao et al., 2020)) and this finding is independent of heating method (volumetric microwave heating or conductive conventional heating). Above the threshold, there is a step change reduction in extraction time when microwave heating is used: for the highest microwave heating power of 200 W optimal extraction is achieved at 45 mins for MAE, compared with around 120 mins for the equivalent heating rate of ~39 °C/min using CSE. This is compelling evidence that some or all of the selective heating effects caused by elevated T local and Temperature-Induced Diffusion (TID) discussed in Section 2.1 and depicted in Fig. 1 becomes significant at higher microwave powers, and the implications of this finding will be discussed further in the following Section 5.The important and novel finding of the experiments in this section is that a microwave power input threshold has been identified.

        <p>We have shown that the heat transfer properties of the biomass can be linked to conventional and microwave extraction performance. Higher thermal conductivity was favourable for conventional extraction, while higher dielectric loss was favourable for microwave extraction. Because of the contribution of solute to dielectric loss and thermal conductivity, the biomasses that were best suited to microwave extraction were least suited to conventional extraction. Although it seems like an obvious conclusion, this is the first study to investigate the contribution of the biomass characteristics to heat and mass transfer during extraction. Since the heating rate was found to have a negligible effect on extraction performance, the thermal conductivity of the biomasses did not have a significant impact on the Conventional Solvent Extraction performance. Conversely, the dielectric properties had a significant effect on Microwave-Assisted Extraction performance due to microwave selective heating.We have shown that the heat transfer properties of the biomass can be linked to conventional and microwave extraction performance.

        <p>This new knowledge can be tested by relating it to previously published work. Using the same extraction conditions as in Section 4.1 of this paper, Mao et al. (2019) found no difference between pectin yields or extraction times for sugar beet extraction using MAE and CSE. Based on our finding here, the sugar -beet pulp -water system is expected to have a similar dielectric loss to water, and a thermal conductivity closer to carrot pulp than the other samples investigated in this paper. To validate this theory, the dielectric loss and conductivity of the sugar beet pulpwater systems were measured. The thermal conductivity was 6.11 W/mK, almost identical to carrot pulp, and the dielectric loss, shown in Fig. 10, was close to that of water.This new knowledge can be tested by relating it to previously published work.

        <p>This paper has identified a power threshold, above-which microwaves exhibit a step-change in performance compared with conventional solvent extraction in cases where the dielectric loss factor of the biomass is higher than that of the solvent. The heating rate of a specific component within a microwave heating system is determined by the power density P d as expressed in Eq. (3). In the case of the experiments reported here, the only experimental variables that could affect the power density are the dielectric loss and the input power (which contributes to the magnitude of the electric field intensity, E). Therefore, in the fruit extraction experiments, the biomass is expected to heat faster than the solvent (T local &gt; T bulk ) based on the dielectric loss measurements. However, there is also conventional heat transfer happening at the same time, which leads to heat loss from the biomass to the solvent. At low heating powers (low E), therefore, the heat loss matches the difference in microwave heating rates of different parts of the system, and T local ~Tbulk at steady state. This appears to have been the situation below input powers of 100-120 W for the experiments reported here for orange peel extraction.This paper has identified a power threshold, above-which microwaves exhibit a step-change in performance compared with conventional solvent extraction in cases where the dielectric loss factor of the biomass is higher than that of the solvent.

        <p>Increasing the microwave input power (above 100-120 W in this case) increases P d, and hence the volumetric heating rate exceeds the rate of heat loss, leading to T local exceeding T bulk . At this point, all or some of the selective heating effects identified in Section 2.1 come into effect. The direct effects of elevated T local could be increased rates of diffusion, hydrolysis and dissolution. However, these changes are expected to be incremental, as the temperature differences under normal operating conditions are predicted to be in the order a few degrees only (Taqi et al., 2020), and the changes observed here are step changes in mass transfer rates.Increasing the microwave input power (above 100-120 W in this case) increases P d, and hence the volumetric heating rate exceeds the rate of heat loss, leading to T local exceeding T bulk .

        <p>The second, indirect, effect that selective heating could have on mass tranfer is Temperature-Induced Diffusion (TID), in which transport processes are driven by temperature gradients in addition to concentration gradients as explained in Section 2.1. The recent work by Taqi et al. (Taqi et al., 2020) investigating the theoretical effects of TID resulting from microwave heating, predicts a threshold in power density above which TID could result in significant differences in mass transfer gradients within the biomass structure. One of the potential outcomes of TID is cell rupture due to pressure increases as more solvent is sucked into the cells (Taqi et al., 2020). However not all extraction is governed by cell rupture, and for pectin in particular it is unlikely that rupture will enhance the extraction of pectin from within cell walls. Other outcomes of TID could include enhanced levels of water activity and corresponding enhanced rates of hydrolysis and/or dissolution, as well as increased diffusion rates due to the higher driving force.The second, indirect, effect that selective heating could have on mass tranfer is Temperature-Induced Diffusion (TID), in which transport processes are driven by temperature gradients in addition to concentration gradients as explained in Section 2.1.

        <p>Despite not governing pectin extraction it is possible that cell rupture was achieved in experiments at power levels above the threshold. However, we note that the yields and compositions of the extracts were similar for microwave and conventional experiments carried out at the same heating rates. If cell rupture had occurred, we would have expected this to have had an observable impact on yield and composition of the extract. While the observation of a threshold power is in line with Taqi's prediction, we don't feel that this is conclusive evidence of cell rupture resulting from TID. Rather, we believe on balance that the results are more consistent with a significant increase in activity or diffusion rate resulting from TID. More work is needed to understand the link between the thermal gradient and the extraction rate, however it is beyond doubt that microwave selective heating leads to step changes in mass transfer during solvent extraction, and this appears to be due to significant acceleration of the rate-limiting diffusion steps.Despite not governing pectin extraction it is possible that cell rupture was achieved in experiments at power levels above the threshold.

        <p>The power threshold identified for the orange peel extraction experiments presented in Section 4.2 was between 100 and 120 W. This threshold will vary depending on the degree of selective heating (determined by dielectric loss and electric field intensity, which is a function of applied power and microwave cavity design) and heat loss (determined by the heat transfer properties of the biomass and solvent, which are affected by system variables such as the sample mass, particle size and biomass tissue structure). Different microwave heating systems support different electric field intensities depending on the applied power, impedance matching, sample size and location, and as a result we would not expect the 100-120 W threshold to apply directly to other microwave heating systems. However, the general principle is that process variables that affect heating rate will be expected to show a similar threshold no matter what microwave heating system is used, and that higher heating rates can be promoted with higher input power, single-mode cavities, active impedance matching and the appropriate sample size.The power threshold identified for the orange peel extraction experiments presented in Section 4.2 was between 100 and 120 W.
