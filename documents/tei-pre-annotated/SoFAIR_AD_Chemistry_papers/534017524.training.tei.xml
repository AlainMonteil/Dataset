        <p>For seamless mirroring of the human body, they also have to display conformability to its curvilinear architecture, as well as recapitulate the mechanical capabilities of organs and tissues such as flexibility and self-healing. The union of soft and hard phases is a common nature-inspired approach for producing materials with advanced mechanical and electrical characteristics. In a similar vein, a facile strategy is developed herein for large-scale production of a multifunctional composite by mixing organic silk fibroin (SF) and inorganic reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The material was coined CareGum and capitalized on a phenolic glue -tannic acid (TA) -to facilitate sacrificial and hierarchical hydrogen bonds of varying strength with SF, TA and rGO. The hierarchal bonding scheme gave rise to high mechanical toughness, excellent conformability to arbitrary and complex surfaces, 3D printability, great electrical properties, as well as rapid self-healing and strong adhesion capacity.For seamless mirroring of the human body, they also have to display conformability to its curvilinear architecture, as well as recapitulate the mechanical capabilities of organs and tissues such as flexibility and self-healing.

        <p>Indeed, the rGO reinforced silk exhibited a record-breaking elongation capacity close to 30000 %, elevated sensing sensitivity by 2-fold, 10-fold increase in electrical conductivity, and 4-fold increase in young modulus compared to its pristine counterpart. By taking advantage of these unique properties, we have for the first time developed a durable and self-healing bionic glove for hand gesture sensing and sign translation. Indeed, CareGum is a new advanced material with promising applications in fields like cyborganics, bionics, soft robotics, human-machine interfaces, 3D printed electronics, flexible bioelectronics, and point-of-care testing.Indeed, the rGO reinforced silk exhibited a record-breaking elongation capacity close to 30000 %, elevated sensing sensitivity by 2-fold, 10-fold increase in electrical conductivity, and 4-fold increase in young modulus compared to its pristine counterpart.

        <p>Silk fibroin extracted from Bombyx Mori (B. mori) cocoons is known for it's recordbreaking specific tensile strength (740 MPa), high toughness (6×10 4 Jkg -1 ), good flexibility, and great resistance towards wear and tear from the environment. [1] The key factor behind these exciting properties stem from strong crystalline -sheets and highly convoluted amorphous domains capable of dissipating mechanical energy within the fibroin backbone-a rare combination that is capable of uniting high mechanical strength and toughness coherently in the one and same system. [2] Their flexibility and softness enable them to integrate with the curvilinear and soft tissues, while their toughness can safeguard them from sudden mechanical failure after integration into body parts that bear load and actuate. For this reason, silk-based materials have been used in flexible electronics for various Bionic devices such as cardiac sensors, brain electrodes electronic skin, and various biomaterial implants. [3] Even though we have witnessed a growing interest in using silk-based electronics to interface between man and machine these approaches are still virgin attempts since they display properties in conflict with how the human body operates and our individualized anatomies. Additionally, besides being durable and resilient human tissues are also capable of undergoing self-healing when damaged; something that unequivocally counts as one of the biggest plusses in the evolution of biological systems. Indeed, without self-healing the survival mechanism of life would be significantly compromised; imagine just for one second living creatures combating diseases and injuries without their inherent healing capacity -ideally any man-made bionic device intended to interface indefinitely with human beings need to self-repair one-way or another. Electronics, going beyond just being conformable, soft and tough, but also embracing self-healing and ionotronics while taking advantage of the rapidly growing field of 3D printing have been prophesied as one of the key enabling technologies for addressing this grand challenge; as this beautiful marriage can yield unbreakable bionics with 3D printed personalized features. [4,5] In simple terms, ionotronic devices operate by conducting electricity via ions instead of electrons like conventional electronics do. [5] Since tissues and organs are animated through complex ionic operations, ionic conductive materials can easily recapitulate the way electrical signals are mediated in living matter to yield electronics operating at the same time and length scales -this is important for manufacturing prosthetics bionics, and biorobots with human-like characteristics. In greater detail the operating principle here is based on ionically conductive materials that can adhere between metal-based electronics and living tissues to establish an intimate communication link between the realms of the animated and the inanimated; either directly, via another medium or through mechanical or electromagnetic transmittance. Unknown to many, silk-based materials besides their flexibility and mechanical toughness also exhibit capacity to conduct electricity via ions -something facilitated by water mediated proton-hopping from amino groups hidden deep within the peptide structure of fibroin and via possible ionic species in the medium. [6] They therefore could potentially position themselves at the very heart of the next-generation of soft electronic materials with the capacity to bridge the thick iron curtain still prevailing between machine and man.Silk fibroin extracted from Bombyx Mori (B. mori) cocoons is known for it's recordbreaking specific tensile strength (740 MPa), high toughness (6×10 4 Jkg -1 ), good flexibility, and great resistance towards wear and tear from the environment.

        <p>Because what is lacking in this direction are hyper combinatorial materials covering a vast property portfolio including adhesiveness to metals and tissues, self-healing, sensing capacity, toughness, flexibility, stretchability, ionic conductivity, and moldability. Unlocking such secrets into the world of animated materials has captivated scientists for centuries dating back to the glory days of the alchemist, but at the same time it gives rise to critical questions regarding whether the proposed almost life-like materials even are feasible -can they exist -if yes can they be generated through economically efficient routes and become readily available for the broader populace? Indeed, a number of obstacles are standing against advances along this new and exciting avenue of material science. Because; how does one engineer a material with flexibility, toughness, strength, softness, adhesiveness, and electrical properties all in one without any unwanted tradeoffs? The story becomes even more combinatorial when selfhealing and printability are added to this already wide portfolio of material properties.Because what is lacking in this direction are hyper combinatorial materials covering a vast property portfolio including adhesiveness to metals and tissues, self-healing, sensing capacity, toughness, flexibility, stretchability, ionic conductivity, and moldability.

        <p>Turning the otherwise incredible silk from an ingredient of great materials of the past into our hypothesized winning material of centuries is not straightforward per say, and therefore never successfully attempted before. Even if the endeavor bode well, most material scientists would anticipate that the running line would only be reachable through a troublesome path and therefore not scalable and of use for society at all.Turning the otherwise incredible silk from an ingredient of great materials of the past into our hypothesized winning material of centuries is not straightforward per say, and therefore never successfully attempted before.

        <p>In the present communication, we have used inspiration from living tissues, to initiate a quest for the abovementioned silk material. In this uncharted territory, we identified a novel and scalable route for generating a Conductive, Adhesive, Reconfigurable, and ViscoElastic gum (CareGum) with sensing capacity based primarily on silk -all through a non-toxic methodology devoid of any complicated chemical procedures. In simple terms; SF was mixed with Tannic acid (TA), calcium chloride (CaCl2), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to facilitate the manufacture of a gum-like SiGo (Figure 1.a). Tannic acid (TA) is a polyphenol retrieved from bark and fruits from various plants and trees. It is also one of the most reactive small molecules in existence today because of a dendritic-like network of hydroxyl rich moieties such as pyrogallols and catechols. Notably, the active groups can mediate spontaneous self-healing based on hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl and amino groups.In the present communication, we have used inspiration from living tissues, to initiate a quest for the abovementioned silk material.

        <p>We also speculated -based on previous studies -that inclusion of CaCl2 could play an important role in generating a CareGum with high toughness due to the electrostatic interaction between positively charged calcium (Ca 2+ ) ions with negatively charged groups in the SF backbone. [7,8] Graphene on the other hand display formidable electrical (sheet resistance 30Ω -1 ), [9] thermal (withstand up to 1000 o C) [9] and mechanical properties (130 GPa, tensile strength) [10] 200 times stronger than that of steel while being ionically active at the same time; [11] something that arises from a unique 2D honeycomb structure. It has therefore been utilized in a wide range of fields e.g., biomedical engineering, electronics, energy harvesting and storage, sensors and composites and coatings. [12] Here, we have explored the impact of different SF -rGO ratios (from 0 to 20 wt% nanomaterial loading) on the self-healing, adhesiveness, mechanical, sensing and electrical properties of SiGo; while keeping the constant weight ratio of SF:TA at 1:5 and 0.1 M CaCl2. The CareGum was not entirely a hydrogel, neither was it completely solid, indeed it was more reminiscent of something in between -almost like a gum -with a water content decreasing from 47% to 36% as the rGO concentration reached 20% (Figure 1b). The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of the CareGum shows microporous structure with 2-3 m pore size, whereas an increased pore sizes with 5-10 m pore size were observed with rGO incorporation due to the formation of wall boundaries around the pores by stacking of rGO layers (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, these increased pores does not contribute to hold a large amount of water in the cross-linked networks. The lower water uptake in the composites could be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the rGO.We also speculated -based on previous studies -that inclusion of CaCl2 could play an important role in generating a CareGum with high toughness due to the electrostatic interaction between positively charged calcium (Ca 2+ ) ions with negatively charged groups in the SF backbone.

        <p>The investigations were complemented by chemical characterizations through Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier-Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy.The investigations were complemented by chemical characterizations through Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier-Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy.</p>
        <p>As shown in the Figure 1d, the FTIR spectra of CareGum samples exhibit prominent signature peaks associated with silk (amide I (1642 cm -1 ), amide II (1515 cm -1 ), amide III (1235 cm -1 )) and TA (C=O stretching (1698 cm -1 ), C-C stretching (1609 cm -1 ), C-O-C stretching (1308 cm -1 )), as expected. [8,13] Specifically, the composite showed a wavenumber shift of the TA associated hydroxyl group (OH) centered at 3400 cm -1 and the amide (NH) associated peak of silk centered at 3290 cm -1 to 3323 cm -1 . These shifts indicate the presence of a multitude of hydrogen bonding schemes between TA and SF of varying strength ranging from OHSF….OHTA (4.7 kcal/mol), NHSF….OHTA (7.4 kcal/mol), and OHTA….C=OSF (4.6 kcal/mol). [14] In addition, the peak at 1698 cm -1 corresponding to the carbonyl group (C=O) of TA is shifted to 1713 cm -1 confirming the weak interaction between silk and TA through NHSF….C=OTA (3.9 kcal/mol) hydrogen bond formation. From FTIR we can also examine possible electrostatic interactions between positively charged calcium (Ca 2+ ) ions with negatively charged amino acids (COO -) such as glutamate and aspartate within the SF chain. [7,8] This interaction did not make a significant change in the peak position of amide peaks, howbeit a decreased intensity of the amide I (1642 cm -1 ) and amide II (1515 cm -1 ) of SF were observed, which according to the literature typically are associated with structural changes occurring in the backbone of the SF chain via the abovementioned electrostatic interactions with Ca 2+ ions. [7,8,15] Further, to improve the conductivity of the CareGum, rGO was incorporated in the composites. Here we employed a green approach to reduce GO by using TA for the chemical reduction process and it will help to modify rGO surface with TA through - interactions, which also benefits in better dispersion of rGO in the composites. In the FTIR spectrum of rGO, the oxides peaks from rGO disappeared and displayed signature peaks from the TA, which confirms the reduction and modification of rGO surface with TA (Supporting information, Figure S1). Therefore, the peaks corresponding to rGO were merged with SF and TA related absorption peaks. However, there is a decrease in intensity corresponding to the amide I and amide II bands within the SF spectra were observed after rGO inclusion (Figure 1d, enlarged spectra ) [8,16] . This additional decrease in intensity could be attributed to possibly conformational changes occurring in the secondary structure of SF due to surface interactions with rGO. We expect that these conformational changes in the molecular level of SF could impact mechanical properties such as toughness and stiffness. Therefore, we deconvoluted the amide I spectra in the 1571-1800 cm -1 region to elucidate the secondary structures present in silk (Supporting information Figure S2). From this analysis, we unraveled four of these including -sheets, random coils, -helices, and -turn structures. [8,16] -sheets are crystalline structures formed by interpeptide antiparallel hydrogen bonded strands -something linked to material stiffness and toughness -while -turns arise from the transformation of loose hairpin structures into tight turns and typically associated with an increase in sample elasticity. [16,17] As you can see in Figure 1b, the addition of TA and CaCl2 increased the -sheets and -turn structures (together 42%) compared to pristine silk (22%) and SiGo without CaCl2 samples (30%) -this could possibly increase the toughness of the CareGum. The mechanism of -structure formation could be explained by Ca 2+ ions disrupting hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges between adjacent SF chains via charge shielding and instead facilitating a conformational transition of random coils to more ordered -structures. [7,8] Interestingly, the nanoreinforcement of CareGum with graphene further increased the percentage of -structures to 49% at the highest rGO concentration. As reported previously, the interface of 2D materials can induce conformational changes from random coils and -helices to crystalline -structures through surface facilitated polypeptide chain folding. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis provided even more insights into the intimate structure of the CareGum matrix, as this methodology mapped out various phase transitions in SF related to glass transition (Tg), crystallization and thermal degradation point (Supplementary Fig. S3). To this end, pristine SF showed a glass transition (Tg) In summary, the many exciting self-healing and mechanical CareGum properties that we will soon bear witness could arise from the hierarchical bonding scheme between SF facilitated by Ca 2+ , TA and rGO and consisting of hydrogen and electrostatic bonds with varying binding strengths. In this scheme, the weak bonds are reversible and thus self-healing, while simultaneously enabling an avenue for dissipating mechanical energy to avoid stress buildup and sudden mechanical failure. This all together can give rise to high toughness and self-healing properties. The electrostatic interactions between SF with TA is also a complementary avenue for dissipating energy since such bonds are reversible as well, but Ca 2+ inclusion can also intensify -structure formation rate as described above and thus increase mechanical toughness.As shown in the Figure 1d, the FTIR spectra of CareGum samples exhibit prominent signature peaks associated with silk (amide I (1642 cm -1 ), amide II (1515 cm -1 ), amide III (1235 cm -1 )) and TA (C=O stretching (1698 cm -1 ), C-C stretching (1609 cm -1 ), C-O-C stretching (1308 cm -1 )), as expected.

        <p>As mentioned previously CareGum is a highly stretchable material capable of rapid self-healing while displaying the ability to become molded into complex shapes and architectures with ease (Supplementary figure S4 that shows this). This is demonstrated in Figure 2.a. Here two pieces of CareGums are gently pushed together to examine self-healing capacity. Indeed, after only a few minutes the individual pieces merged into one CareGum that could stretch homogenously along its x-axis (Figure 2.b). Notably, CareGum readily molded into a ring almost like play-dough and could elongate to around 240 times its original length after healing. The rapid healing process is examined in greater detail in Figure 2.c through optical images acquired at different time-points in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 2.d). The self-healing properties were scrutinized further in Figure 2.e through compression testing before (pristine) and after healing at both 25 and 37 degrees. These results demonstrate that CareGum could heal with 95% efficiency after 1 min. The trend was pretty much the same at both temperatures.As mentioned previously CareGum is a highly stretchable material capable of rapid self-healing while displaying the ability to become molded into complex shapes and architectures with ease (Supplementary figure S4 that shows this).

        <p>In recent years, smart electronic textiles have emerged as promising healthcare monitors for continuous health tracking and human-machine-interfacing via Bionics as they are capable of blending with the patient's anatomy without any discomfort. [18] Most of these functionalities were achieved on textiles through embedding rigid electronics within them. Unfortunately, an inherent mismatch between heaviness/rigidity and flexibility/lightweight has until now compromised the durability, patient comfort and aesthetic appearance of such devices. Here, we attempted to produce electronic and self-healing fibers with CareGum that potentially can become embroidered into smart textiles in a seamless manner making them more durable and comfortable to wear for the user. To this end, a simple melt spinning process at 60 o C was employed to transform the CareGum into fibers with millimeter sized diameters via extrusion through a syringe nozzle (Figure 2f). In brief, during heating the reversible hydrogen bonds between SF and TA breaks, thereby reducing the bulk viscosity making it more liquid-like and easier to extrude. This process does not require any additional pre-treatment or post-treatment like other hydrogel wet spinning techniques, indeed compared to their conventional counterparts a rapid cooling to room temperature produced very smooth fibers. The flexibility and weaving ability of the CareGum melt spun fibers are demonstrated in the Figure 2f To this end, we showed that they were readily twistable into cable-like structures and could interlace into woven-like textiles (supplementary figure S5) -importantly they could self-heal within seconds if damaged. In summary, we have demonstrated that the Caregum can give rise to thin self-healing fibers via melt spinning; something which potentially can open a new additive manufacturing window for producing 2D and 3D soft woven structures with combinatorial material properties.In recent years, smart electronic textiles have emerged as promising healthcare monitors for continuous health tracking and human-machine-interfacing via Bionics as they are capable of blending with the patient's anatomy without any discomfort.

In summary, we have demonstrated that the Caregum can give rise to thin self-healing fibers via melt spinning; something which potentially can open a new additive manufacturing window for producing 2D and 3D soft woven structures with combinatorial material properties.</p>

        <p>Given the abundant catechol groups on TA and reactive hydroxyl groups on rGO we hypothesized that SiGo could adhere to a wide range of surfaces ranging from tissues, polymers to metals by mimicking a mussel adhesion mechanism. [19] In Figure 2.d-e we have tried to uncover this exciting property by initially using a simple gravitybased test wherein the Caregum was sandwiched between a 100 g weight and various surfaces including glass and porcine skin. These images clearly demonstrate its incredible gluing property as the CareGum could stretch to 15 times without becoming structurally unstable, while facilitating a strong surface adherence after the weight was in free fall mode. We then made use of lap shear testing (Figure 2.f) to quantify the adhesiveness of CareGum to both tissue, metal and glass interfaces. In most of these curves we observed a gradual peel-off process with a long stripping lag phase; something reminiscent of a robust adherence mediated through a balanced contribution of adhesion and cohesion (supplementary figure S6). The results have been quantified and displayed in Figure 2.g.-h. From here it is evident that the shear stress needed to facilitate adhesive failure increased dramatically as a function of rGO concentration on brass and stainless; while it was fairly rGO-independent on Glass.Given the abundant catechol groups on TA and reactive hydroxyl groups on rGO we hypothesized that SiGo could adhere to a wide range of surfaces ranging from tissues, polymers to metals by mimicking a mussel adhesion mechanism.

        <p>Specifically, the highest adhesion strength was found on brass ranging between 48 -144 kPa (0 to 20%) and the lowest on glass (50-58 kPa) and Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (10-19 kPa). On the other hand, the adhesion strength on skin, muscle, and heart was pretty much unaffected by the rGO concentration. Here, the highest adhesion strength was determined for skin ranging between 16.6-18.6 kPa and the lowest on muscle and heart ranging between 3.7-5.5 kPa and 4.0-5.0 kPa; respectively. We speculate, that the strong adhesion to skin is caused by possible hydrogen bonds with OH-groups available on keratin and ceramides in the outermost layers of skin and OH-groups from rGO and TA. [20] Indeed; almost 20 % of the skin is made from the hydroxyl rich amino acids proline, glycine and hydroxyproline. [21] On brass and stainless steel the interaction could possibly be mediated by electronic or van der wall interactions between rGO and the metal surfaces; [22] befitting the observed link between adhesion strength and rGO concentration in Figure 2g-h.Specifically, the highest adhesion strength was found on brass ranging between 48 -144 kPa (0 to 20%) and the lowest on glass (50-58 kPa) and Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (10-19 kPa).

        <p>Native-like mechanical properties are crucial for securing durable and nativelike integration with living and mechanically active tissues including bone, cartilage, muscle and heart. In a worst-case scenario a mismatch can facilitate scar tissue formation ultimately leading to device failure. This prompted us to carry out a series of mechanical tests beginning with tensile testing (Figure 3.a). From here a formidable extension capacity is demonstrated close to around 30000 % for some of the samples -almost three-fold larger than the current record at 10000 %. [23] In this study the authors doped the backbone of (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) with pyridinecarboxamide (pdca) to establish a coordination complex mediated by Fe 3+ . In doing so they also managed to make the PDSM self-healing; albeit at a much lower rate than what is observed in Figure 2. In comparison standard sylgaard 184 PDMS can only elongate 200 % before rupturing, while other elastic polymers including SEBS and polyurethane break at 700 % and 280 % strain, respectively. [24] The observed stretching property for the CareGum material increased from 20500% (toughness: 8.9 ± 1.1 MJ m -3 ) to 24000 % (toughness: 9.9 ± 1.9 MJ m -3 ) with 10% rGO incorporation and then dropped to 15500% (toughness: 13.9 ±2.2 MJ m -3 ) for the highest rGO concentration, while the tensile strength seemed unaffected by rGO (Figure 3.b-c). This phenomenon is widely encountered in the field of nanoreinforced soft materials and typically caused by mechanical stress build-up and the associated devastating energy burst release from nanomaterials sliding over one another almost in a similar vein earth quakes are generated from friction between tectonic plates. On the contrary a sharp three-fold increase in compressive strength from 287 to 820 kPa is seen as the rGO incorporation increased to 20% (Figure 3.d). Likewise, the young modulus increased four-fold from 5.7 to 21.7 MPa. We expected this due to the reported formidable mechanical properties of graphene-and the fact that it becomes fully exploited in compressive mode as the rGO-rGO spacing dramatically decreases here ultimately enabling the hard phase of the CareGum to outcompete the soft phase.Native-like mechanical properties are crucial for securing durable and nativelike integration with living and mechanically active tissues including bone, cartilage, muscle and heart.

        <p>Similarly, an intimate link between rGO concentration and energy dissipation was discovered in Figure 3.d. To this end, a rGO concentration change from 0  20% increased the energy dissipation from 0.29  0.61 MJ/m 3 (Figure 3.d). Notably, after the first cycle we observed a fairly cyclic behavior at 30 % with almost 16% hysteresis for SiGo-0% and 22% hysteresis with SiGo-20% from cycles 2  4. This slight increase in hysteresis with rGO incorporated samples may be due to the loss of energy by friction. To improve the cyclicity of our silk-inspired CareGum even more we embedded it within a 3M VHB-tape and ran the same number of cycles as before but this time up-to 600 % strain. Here, smaller energy dissipation ranging from 0.09-0.085 MJ/m 3 (2 4) was observed with only 5% hysteresis. The results in Figure 3 therefore paint a promising picture of a mechanical durable material befitting the many demanding environments of the human body.Similarly, an intimate link between rGO concentration and energy dissipation was discovered in Figure 3.d.

        <p>Next, we carried out electromechanical tests to examine the relation between electrical resistance and mechanical deformations involving stretching, bending and twisting (Figure 3e). To measure the resistance changes, both ends of the CareGum strips (30 x 5 x 1 mm) were connected to a tin plated copper foils and then embedded within a 3M VHB tape to improve their recovery. Then, CareGums were stretched up to 600% strain while we examined the relative resistance changes (ΔR/R0, where ΔR = R-R0, R is the change in resistance and R0 is the initial resistance) as function of strain. Notably. when compared to other CareGums, a lower hysteresis was observed with SiGo-20% due to its high elastic nature after rGO incorporation (Supplementary figure S7a). We therefore decided to rely solely on this composition in the following electromechanical bend and twist tests. To this end, we observed that the relative resistance change for SiGo-20% only increased with 12 % twisting after four twists and 19 % after bending (angle between 1-180 o ). We can thus confidently conclude that CareGum is a really durable sensor even when undergoing extreme mechanical deformations. Overall, the results highlighted here demonstrate that the CareGum is a promising component for flexible electronics -especially in wearable applications where the monitoring of multidirectional body movements without loss of electrical functionality is required Even though, a low resistance change (R/R0) per strain -referred to as gauge factor (GF) -bodes well for flexible electronics that needs to remain electrically active during the extreme shear strains typically encountered in disruptive technologies including bendable displays, electronic-skin, soft robotics and origami electronics. On the other hand; if the GF-value becomes compromised the sensitivity drops. To make ends meet; strain-gauge sensors were GF and resistance drop are fairly balanced are thus highly desirable in the field. Typically, highly stretchable and self-healable soft hydrogels show very low GF compared to brittle strain sensors. For instance, the values reported for metal-based strain-gauges are around 2.0, however they can sustain only very small strains up to 5%, whereas the soft hydrogels are extendable in the range 100-1000% with GF-values between 0.125 -1.6. [25] Hydrogel-based sensor is thus carving a new exciting path in the field compared to their conventional metal-based counterparts. In this direction, our stretchable CareGum material showed a comparable GF = 0.5 at 100% strain, increasing to 0.64 at 600% strain. The inclusion of 20 % rGO showed a lower GF value below 300% (GF= 0.31 at 100%), however it significantly improved above 300% reaching GF = 1.04 at 600% (Supplementary Figure S7b). The inclusion of rGO therefore improved the mechanical strain-sensitivity by almost two-fold.Next, we carried out electromechanical tests to examine the relation between electrical resistance and mechanical deformations involving stretching, bending and twisting (Figure 3e).

        <p>Biomechanical sensing have open up for novel opportunities in continuous healthcare monitoring covering diseases in which parameters such as swelling, actuation, strain and movement play an important role. [26] Traditionally, this forum has been based on technologies ranging from various capture imaging setups to electronics consisting of gyroscopes, magnetometers and accelerometers. [27] The later is an enabling technology and currently driving the engine in the field of wearable electronics, but at their very heart a number of limitations such as rigidity issues, high-cost, low-sensitivity and non-durability still prevails.

        <p>We foresee that the CareGum because of the described moldability in Figure 2 can become useful in customized biosensors capable of melding with patient-specific details and individual anatomies. In combination with 3D printing we envision the possibility of on-site manufacturing of personalized sensors to target a wide range of diseases in greater detail. A key requirement in this direction is shear-thinning capacity. Such materials are easily extruded through an extrusion needle in response to proper shear force.

        <p>However; the storage modulus of CareGums incorporating 20 % rGO dropped dramatically with increasing temperature reaching 32 kPa at 50 (Figure 4 We next examined the fluid mechanical properties of the CareGum as a function of rGO content (Figure 4.c). At 0 % rGO CareGum behaved like a pseudoplastic fluid, but at higher rGO content the behavior turned into something more reminiscent of a Newtonian fluid. We speculate, that the transition from a parable-shaped non-Newtonian fluid to a more linearly one is in reality marking a transition into the realm of shear-thickening materials (Dilatants) -since Dilatants are famed for the ability to increase their mechanical properties in response to shear rate. [28] This property shields them against sudden mechanical shocks and the observed trend in this direction correlates well with a number of recent studies demonstrating that nano and micro materials hold the secrets of shock-absorbing fluids. We anticipate that even higher rGO concentration could potentially give rise to such properties in the CareGum as well, however, it was unfortunately not possible to load the CareGum with more rGO.However; the storage modulus of CareGums incorporating 20 % rGO dropped dramatically with increasing temperature reaching 32 kPa at 50 (Figure 4 We next examined the fluid mechanical properties of the CareGum as a function of rGO content (Figure 4.c).

        <p>In Figure 4.d we have utilized the unique rheological properties of the CareGum and molded it into complex shapes and in Figure 4.e we have shown that it can conform on the curvilinear shape of a human finger and follow it during various bend-related movements. The impressive configurability of CareGum encouraged us to build soft and self-healing electronic circuits of varying complexity by using an inhouse-built pen-dispenser (Figure 4.f). Briefly, we are able to illuminate a LED lamp connected to the deposited circuits. As a next step, we dispensed a simple linear circuit with electrical self-healing capacity (Figure 4.g) and showed that it is capable of illuminating a LED lamp. As expected, once the soft circuit is cut into two pieces the conductive drops and consequently the LED stops glowing. Advantageously, the circuit quickly healed both electrically and mechanically, as evident from the LED intensity and the high stretching capacity of the healed circuit. This is more clearly demonstrated in Figure 4.g, wherefrom we have calculated en electrical recovery time at 60s. Notably, the circuit could recover cyclically as evident from Figure 4.f. Finally, in Figure 4.h we have tried to capture the relation between conductivity and rGO content. From here a sharp 10-fold increase from 1 x 10 -3 to 1 x 10 -2 S cm -1 is observed as the rGO content varied from 0 to 20%. Despite the reported moderate CareGum conductivity it still surpassed values typically seen in tissues; indeed cerebrospinal fluid -a tissue holding the highest conductivity in the human bodydisplay a value appreciably lower than the CareGum at around 15 x 10 -3 S/cm. [29] We finally utilized the unique rheological properties of CareGum to custom print various designs with a number of well-established printing technologies. First, we used screen-printing, which is a simple method for creating complicated patterns based on a screen pattern transfer technique, in which a negative screen with the desired pattern is placed against a print substrate. In brief, by heating the CareGum up to 60 o C it started to flow -almost in a honey-like manner -and thus was easily pushed through the negative screen and onto the substrate in complex designs (Figure 4.i-j). The methodology showcased in Figure 4 is an elegant forerunner towards the final goal of customized wearable electronics that can capture personalized information much better than its predecessors. In this vision of ours, the personalization is established by custom-printing the electronics in desired circuitries matching the targeted tissue. Specifically, in this scenario, 3D extrusion printing technology can be combined with scanners to yield biomechanical sensors that can connect with pivotal locomotion points within the patient's body. We have demonstrated the capability and feasibility of the 3D printing of CareGum materials by utilizing a thermal-assisted extrusion technique. To achieve this, wet samples of SiGo-20% samples were loaded into a steel syringe with a plunger mounted to a heating element. The syringe were heated up to 40 o C and slowly extruded (speed 18 mm/min) through a nozzle with a diameter size of 2mm. Figure 4 j shows the various complex 3D printed structures including spiral, square, cube, pyramid, and cylinder. It is also evident that the 3D printed structures of SiGo-20% were strong and elastic enough to support its own weight. The fast self-healing ability of the CareGums was a greater advantage here, which helped to heal the layers very quickly to form the 3D stacks.In Figure 4.d we have utilized the unique rheological properties of the CareGum and molded it into complex shapes and in Figure 4.e we have shown that it can conform on the curvilinear shape of a human finger and follow it during various bend-related movements.

        <p>Building on these results we have generated an electronic glove (E-glove) that is capable of monitoring complex hand movements; something useful for improving dexterity of surgeons, recreational virtual gaming, musical training, sign language translation and as a rehabilitation tool for patients with hand injuries (Figure 5.a). The E-glove is essentially based on three major components: 1) VHS encapsulated CareGum sensors situated on important locomotion points on the hand, 2) a signal processing unit consisting of a wheatstone bridge for signal amplifying and a Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) that can filtrate and convert acquired data from analog to digital format, and 3) A microcontroller for handling data flow and data transfer to a PC (Figure 5.a).

        <p>Here, we have utilized five different channels -each of them covering the motion of a specific finger. Evidently, the E-glove is capable of discerning a number of signs including stop, ok, victory, strength and the numbers one and three by utilizing various five channels. Next we proceeded to demonstrate one of the first ever built cybernetic extensions with self-healing capacity (Figure 5.c). In Figure 5.c photographic images of the cybernetic E-glove in the stop, ok, impaired and self-ok and stop configuration are matched with their associated ADC signals in a custombuilt PC program. Notably, from Figure 4.c a record-breaking self-healing in multicomponent electronics at 10s is observed; a record until now held at 100s by a recently developed multifunctional electronic skin system at Stanford University. [30] Even though self-healing electronics have been around for some years; in this study, we have brought this concept to an even more advanced stage heralding the promise of robust or perhaps even unbreakable consumer electronics. Ionic conductive hydrogels have been rapidly picked up by engineers to fuel great advances in soft ionotronics. Especially, the unique combination of soft hydrogel-like materials with stretchability, transparency and ionic conductivity have given rise to a number of exciting applications including, electronic displays, artificial skin, optoelectronics and strain sensors; thereby encouraging their usage in flexible bioelectronics for real-time healthcare monitoring and user empowerment. [31] However, adhesion, self-healing and 3D printing capacity is properties needed of such sensors before customized and personalized wearable's can see the light of day.Here, we have utilized five different channels -each of them covering the motion of a specific finger. Evidently, the E-glove is capable of discerning a number of signs including stop, ok, victory, strength and the numbers one and three by utilizing various five channels. Next we proceeded to demonstrate one of the first ever built cybernetic extensions with self-healing capacity (Figure 5.c). In Figure 5.c photographic images of the cybernetic E-glove in the stop, ok, impaired and self-ok and stop configuration are matched with their associated ADC signals in a custombuilt PC program. Notably, from Figure 4.c a record-breaking self-healing in multicomponent electronics at 10s is observed; a record until now held at 100s by a recently developed multifunctional electronic skin system at Stanford University. [30] Even though self-healing electronics have been around for some years; in this study, we have brought this concept to an even more advanced stage heralding the promise of robust or perhaps even unbreakable consumer electronics.

        <p>Materials displaying such galaxy of properties are definitely going to soar in the coming years, not only as components in future bionics but also generally speaking in the fields of material science, engineering and electronics. In this study we have used the beautiful marriage between silk (Si), Calcium (Ca +2 ) tannic acid (TA) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to uncover such exciting materials. We coined the material CareGum and demonstrated that it could outperform most conventional systems in terms of self-healing rate (few seconds), toughness (13.9 ±2.2 MJ m -3 ), elongation (30000 %) and multifunctionality. Generally speaking, most self-healing soft materials display low fracture toughness -typically in the kJ/m -3 range and heal completely only after several hours. [32] We speculate that the observed incredible CareGum toughness stem from the hierarchal crosslinking scheme behind it. This is a similar mechanism as the one observed in natural materials including bone, nacre, mussels and wood; wherein a palette of bonding types ranging from hydrogen and weak electrostatic bonds can act as a counteractive measure against crack formation to stronger covalent bonds capable of ensuring a stable and long-standing structural form. [33] The rapid self-healing time is on the other hand most likely caused by the plethora of dominant hydrogen bonds present within the CareGum matrix as their characteristic formation rate is appreciable faster than that of other self-healing crosslinks including hydrophobic, electrostatic and dynamic covalent bonds. [34] In conclusion, we envision that CareGum-based ionotronics can be implemented in applications covering robotics, cybernetics, bionics, cyborganics, wearable electronics and implantable devices. Indeed; many of todays wearable electronics and robots use hard and rigid components that restrict locomotion freedom and limits device durability. As an example, the performance of conventional exoskeletons are currently compromised by dangling wires, bulky microprocessors and fragile electronics. Moreover, despite the fact flexible and tough electrically materials are slowly gaining momentum in this direction only few of the reported materials used in these systems encompass one of the most important requirements of living tissues, namely the ability to heal on demand in the event of injury or damage.Materials displaying such galaxy of properties are definitely going to soar in the coming years, not only as components in future bionics but also generally speaking in the fields of material science, engineering and electronics.
