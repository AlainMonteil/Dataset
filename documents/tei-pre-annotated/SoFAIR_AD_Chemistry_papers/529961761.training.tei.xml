        <p>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as an alternative to ionic liquids (ILs). DESs share with ILs some appealing features, such as low vapor pressure, capability to dissolve reagents insoluble in common organic solvents, and the possibility to tune the overall pH of the medium by replacing one of the constituents of the mixture. Furthermore, DESs can be prepared by combining molecules that come from natural sources (i.e., glycerol, glucose), making them biodegradable. DESs have already been used for a variety of reactions and protocols since they were reported for the first time by A. P. Abbott, G.

        <p>L. Davies, R. K. Rasheed and V. Tambyrajah, Chem. Commun., 2003, 70, and among the reactions studied, organic oxidation has recently gained much attention. In particular, the recyclability of these ionic compounds makes it possible to achieve anchoring of organic oxidants, such as TEMPO and peroxydisulfate, directly onto one species of the DES mixture components. In addition, their solubility properties play a crucial role in organic oxidation since DESs have the ability to dissolve both organic lipophilic and hydrophilic species, making the oxidation of organic compounds mediated by hydrogen peroxide more efficient. Herein we report the state of the art of this developing field, focusing on the benefits of substituting common organic solvents with DESs, especially in terms of sustainability, enhancement of reactivity, and recyclability.L.

        <p>Ionic liquids (ILs) have been of interest for more than 40 years as alternative media for a wide variety of applications 1 and they have attracted significant attention in the past two decades in many areas of chemistry such as materials, 2 separation, 3 electrochemistry, 4 biomass valorization 5 and catalysis. 6 While they were initially championed as being 'green' due to their low vapor pressure, their use is seen primarily as enabling processes which are difficult in molecular solvents. Primarily their unusual solvent properties and phase behavior have been utilized. A prime example of this is the BASIL process which uses an imidazole to neutralize an acid by-product from a reaction. The process intensification enabled by the formation of a liquid imidazolium chloride by-product decreases solvent use, negates a filtration process and results in a significant increase in process yield. 7 Early-generation ILs were formed by metals such as aluminium, tin and zinc and these were used in part as liquid catalysts for Lewis acid-catalyzed reactions. When the reagents and products were liquids then these were effectively solvent-free processes. Further research was then carried out to find metal-free alternatives, which maintained the required solvent properties, and a new class of ILs was designed by combining metal-free cations, mainly imidazolium analogues, with several coordinating and non-coordinating anions such as Cl -, BF 4 -, PF 6 -and NTf 2 -. 8 While these have been proposedIonic liquids (ILs) have been of interest for more than 40 years as alternative media for a wide variety of applications 1 and they have attracted significant attention in the past two decades in many areas of chemistry such as materials, 2 separation, 3 electrochemistry, 4 biomass valorization 5 and catalysis. 6 While they were initially championed as being 'green' due to their low vapor pressure, their use is seen primarily as enabling processes which are difficult in molecular solvents.

        <p>as green solvents, the fact that they are toxic, expensive to produce, and do not in many cases easily biodegrade has negated many opinions of their green credentials. 9 The term ionic liquid was initially rigorously applied to systems that only contained ionic species which melted below 100 °C, but this definition has slowly been relaxed to include a wider range of fluids where ionic character tends to dominate solvent-solute interactions. 10 Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are just one of these ion-dominated systems which have been found to be useful for a variety of applications. DESs are easily formed by mixing the components, usually an ammonium salt and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD). DESs have the toxicological properties of the two components and so the choice of benign starting materials can produce materials of low toxicity. The majority of these components are low-cost and biodegradable. Many can be extracted from biomass, increasing their sustainability credentials. 11 Among the ammonium salts, choline chloride (ChCl) is one of the most commonly used components. It is used on a large scale in a variety of commodity products including as an animal feed additive as it is a pro-vitamin. It is therefore biodegradable, available at low cost, has low toxicity and can be accessible from biomass. Choline chloride forms a eutectic mixture when blended with a HBD such as urea, glucose and oxalic acid. The addition of the HBDs decreases the lattice energy of both homocouples, reducing the freezing point. In recent years, a plethora of HBDs have been reported in the literature, producing a large library of ChCl-based DESs that covers a wide spectrum of physical and chemical properties. In addition, several alternatives to ChCl have been presented and the tuning of the two components seems to be the key to create the suitable medium required for each particular process. Some examples of salts and HBDs are summarized in Table 1. 12 While the first definition of DESs involved quaternary ammonium salt and hydrogen bond donor mixtures, they can be more generally described as mixtures of Brønsted and Lewis acids and bases. In all these systems strong hydrogen bonds develop and these deviate from ideal mixtures, resulting in a significant depression of freezing point. Similar mixtures of Brønsted and Lewis acids and bases are commonly found in nature and the term natural DESs has been coined, although this should only be applied to naturally occurring mixtures rather than those synthesized from naturally occurring starting materials. 13 Generally, an appreciable depression of the freezing point is observed and the magnitude of that depression is related to the strength of the bond formed between the two components, i.e. AlCl 3 will exhibit a greater depression of freezing point than an alcoholic HBD such as glucose.as green solvents, the fact that they are toxic, expensive to produce, and do not in many cases easily biodegrade has negated many opinions of their green credentials. 9 The term ionic liquid was initially rigorously applied to systems that only contained ionic species which melted below 100 °C, but this definition has slowly been relaxed to include a wider range of fluids where ionic character tends to dominate solvent-solute interactions. 10 Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are just one of these ion-dominated systems which have been found to be useful for a variety of applications.

        <p>DESs have been used in numerous applications, such as for metal-organic framework (MOF) synthesis, nanoparticle preparation and gasoline desulfurization and as a medium for organic reactions. 11b,24,25 Among organic reactions, oxidation reactions are well-known to be fundamental transformations in both industry and academia due to their capability to turn inert molecules into more reactive analogues prone to undergo further transformations. For example, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) in free radical halogenation is a well-known protocol to prepare chlorinated solvents (chloroform, hexachlorobutadiene and dichloromethane) starting from fossil resources; 26 ozonolysis is generally employed to fragment alkynes to prepare carboxylic acids, 27 and the hydroxylation of the C-H bond is used to convert lipophilic compounds into hydrophobic analogues for environmental and pharmaceutical purposes (Scheme 1). 28DESs have been used in numerous applications, such as for metal-organic framework (MOF) synthesis, nanoparticle preparation and gasoline desulfurization and as a medium for organic reactions. 11b,24,25 Among organic reactions, oxidation reactions are well-known to be fundamental transformations in both industry and academia due to their capability to turn inert molecules into more reactive analogues prone to undergo further transformations.

        <p>Ionic fluids have different solvent-solvent-solute interactions and this results in significantly different physicochemical properties. These properties are easily tuned by changing the type and composition of the constituents. Among these, freezing point, viscosity, conductivity and pH have to be well characterized since they can significantly affect the reactivity and mass transport.Ionic fluids have different solvent-solvent-solute interactions and this results in significantly different physicochemical properties.

        <p>Freezing point is among the most important properties as this can limit the temperature range during the reaction screening in the optimization stage. Freezing-point depression upon formation of DESs is related to the magnitude of the interaction between the components being mixed. For example, in the formation of reline, which is a mixture of ChCl and urea, the lattice energy of ChCl, which is a measure of the cohesive forces that bind the ions to each other, is perturbed by the urea molecules present in the mixture, which disrupt the original framework by mutual interaction between halide anions (ChCl) and the hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogen atom (urea). When choline chloride and urea are mixed together (in a molar ratio of 1 : 2), the resulting freezing point of the mixture is 12 °C, whereas the melting points of ChCl and urea are 302 and 133 °C, respectively. 11a Generally, room temperature DESs are the most desirable ones because they allow performing reactions at lower temperature for minimizing the energy requirements of the process. Unfortunately, the number of DESs that are liquid at room temperature is still very limited. In Table 3 the freezing point of several DESs reported in the literature is shown.Freezing point is among the most important properties as this can limit the temperature range during the reaction screening in the optimization stage.

        <p>It is clear, by looking at the structure of the HBDs capable of forming room-temperature DESs that molecules able to sequestrate the halide anion by a strong hydrogen bond are good candidates (urea, 2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide, levulinic acid, xylitol, D-sorbitol, etc.). In the context of organic reactions, the capability of the solvent to remain liquid at low temperatures is sometimes crucial in order to minimize the side reaction pathways. Among the physical properties, vapor pressure is closely related to environmental concerns. Solvents exhibiting a low vapor pressure can be more easily separated from much more volatile reaction species, hence recovered. This makes DESs ideal from this perspective since they have a negligible vapor pressure.It is clear, by looking at the structure of the HBDs capable of forming room-temperature DESs that molecules able to sequestrate the halide anion by a strong hydrogen bond are good candidates (urea, 2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide, levulinic acid, xylitol, D-sorbitol, etc.).

        <p>Most DESs have viscosities in the range of 10 to 1000 cP at room temperature, which is significantly higher than that of molecular solvents, typically 1 cP. The high viscosity results from the large size of the solvent molecules (ions) and the extensive hydrogen bonding network which results in a low molar volume and a small free volume in the liquid. The viscosity of DESs has been modelled using hole theory which assumes that the movement of charges is limited by the availability of free volumes large enough to accept the ions. 29 Most reactions are mass transport limited so solvent viscosity is important in controlling reaction rates. 30,31 The viscosity of DESs can be significantly decreased by the addition of even a small amount of a molecular solvent, particularly water or even the reagent itself. It has been shown that molecular liquids are heterogeneous with DESs. Water is found to form a microemulsion when mixed with DESs using dynamic light scattering and NMR spectroscopy. 30b,32 This has been shown to be important for the electropolymerization of aniline and could control the mechanism of other reactions in mixed media. 33Most DESs have viscosities in the range of 10 to 1000 cP at room temperature, which is significantly higher than that of molecular solvents, typically 1 cP.

        <p>Numerous studies have shown that the conductivity of ionic liquids and DESs does not follow the classical model for ionic strength but instead it has been shown by numerous groups that conductivity is proportional to fluidity (1/ viscosity). Accordingly, since the liquids are relatively viscous they have conductivities which are significantly lower than that expected for a solution with an ionic strength in the range 4-6 mol dm -3 . Typically the conductivities of DESs are in the range 0.1 to 5 mS cm -1 . The conductivity of ionic liquids and DESs has been accurately predicted using hole theory. 34Numerous studies have shown that the conductivity of ionic liquids and DESs does not follow the classical model for ionic strength but instead it has been shown by numerous groups that conductivity is proportional to fluidity (1/ viscosity).

        <p>Polarity is another property that must be carefully evaluated before designing a reaction, especially organic reactions, since it can affect the solubility of the reactants and change the activation energy drastically. It is possible to understand the polarity effect on some reactions considering as examples the S N 1 and S N 2 reaction mechanisms. S N 1 reactions occur considerably faster in polar solvents since the first step involves the formation of a carbocation, which can be stabilized by a polar solvent decreasing the activation energy Δ, whereas no significant effect can be observed in S N 2 reactions, which do not involve charged intermediates. 35 Owing to their composition, DESs have high polarity, which can be evaluated using the E T (30) scale (electronic transition energy of a probe dye in a solvent). 36 Similar data have been obtained for Kamlet and Taft polarity parameters (Table 4) and these also show that all DESs have similarly high values for all parameters. 37 Table 3 Freezing points of some room-temperature liquid DESs While pH is a difficult concept to characterize in non-aqueous solutions, a recent study 38 used a classic colorimetric indicator, bromophenol blue, to quantify the pK a of organic acids in ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents. The pK a values for 9 organic acids were found to be about 0.5 units higher than that of the corresponding aqueous solution which was rationalized in terms of the different concentrations of bases when comparing DESs with water. As would be expected, the addition of more ChCl to the DES makes the mixture more basic. The same was found for more traditional ionic liquids where the basicity of the anion controlled the overall pH, although [Bmim] [BF 4 ] was found to be more acidic than expected due to the hydrolysis of the anion forming HF. pH values for pure DESs were determined using a glass electrode and found to be in good agreement with colorimetric measurements. Some examples of DES pH are given in Table 4. Clearly, HBDs which are carboxylic acids have a much lower pH than HBDs with OH moieties. Those with amides tend to be slightly alkaline as might be expected.Polarity is another property that must be carefully evaluated before designing a reaction, especially organic reactions, since it can affect the solubility of the reactants and change the activation energy drastically.

        <p>Recently the dissolution behavior of a variety of d-and p-block metal oxides was studied in DESs and it was found that for non-coordinating acids the solubility of the metal oxides was directly correlated with the acid strength as the proton acts as an oxygen acceptor. This understanding of DES pH should be directly transferrable to an understanding of organic reactivity.Recently the dissolution behavior of a variety of d-and p-block metal oxides was studied in DESs and it was found that for non-coordinating acids the solubility of the metal oxides was directly correlated with the acid strength as the proton acts as an oxygen acceptor.

        <p>Due to the increasing demand of new transformations of renewable resources, many efforts have been dedicated to the design of new processes for a more sustainable valorization of raw materials. Within this realm, the processing of lignocellulosic biomass has gained attention as a renewable alternative to fossil resources. 39 In this context, Mu and coworkers reported an efficient catalytic method to convert cellulose, the most abundant component in lignocellulosic biomass, into gluconic acid in DESs, employing FeCl 3 as a catalyst for the aerobic oxidation step. The reaction is followed by a spontaneous self-precipitation of the products, which makes the process appealing for industrial purposes. 40 Aware of the capability of highly concentrated FeCl 3 aqueous solutions to catalyze the oxidation of cellulose into gluconic acid, the authors designed a protocol using DESs as reaction media in order to overcome the reuse of the FeCl 3 and the separation of the gluconic acid, which is not trivial. 41 Scheme 2 shows the reaction proposed by Mu et al. 40 The authors prepared several DESs by mixing FeCl 3 with different HBDs (ethylene glycol (EG), malonic acid, glycine and xylitol, to mention some), obtaining DESs with low viscosity and good conductivity when compared to other common DESs. Furthermore, these DESs exhibited a relatively high acidity, a crucial feature to promote the first step of the reaction, that is, the hydrolysis of cellulose into monomeric glucose. The temperature effect was investigated as well, and it was found that the best conditions in terms of conversion and selectivity were achieved using FeCl 3 -EG as a DES at 120 °C. Full conversion was achieved in one hour with a 52.7% yield of gluconic acid that can be simply collected by filtration due to its insolubility in the medium after cooling.Due to the increasing demand of new transformations of renewable resources, many efforts have been dedicated to the design of new processes for a more sustainable valorization of raw materials.

        <p>Despite the DESs used exhibiting a low freezing point (-55 °C to -66 °C), high temperatures were required in order to increase the selectivity; the concentration of cellulose played an important role as well, as shown in Fig. 1.Despite the DESs used exhibiting a low freezing point (-55 °C to -66 °C), high temperatures were required in order to increase the selectivity; the concentration of cellulose played an important role as well, as shown in Fig. 1.</p>
        <p>Among the oxidation reactions catalyzed by FeCl 3 , oxidation of toluene into benzaldehyde is another important key transformation in the chemical industry, toluene being the cheapest and primary source of aromatic compounds. Unfortunately, the selective partial oxidation still remains a great challenge, partly due to the more favorable tendency of the aldehyde to undergo overoxidation to benzoic acid. Operationally this requires performing the reaction while keeping the concentration of toluene very high. 42 Guajardo and co-workers reported a protocol to convert toluene into benzaldehyde with hydrogen peroxide in DESs. 43 Despite hydrogen peroxide being often recognized as a green reactant, it is poorly soluble in organic solvents and, in some cases, the reaction must be performed under a PTC (phase transfer catalysis) regime, with water having a detrimental effect on the selectivity by promoting the oxidation of benzaldehyde into the undesirable benzoic acid. It is wellknown that ILs allow the capture of water formed, decreasing the side reaction. 44 The work disclosed by Guajardo represents an alternative in which the more desirable DESs are used instead of ILs. Sodium tungstate (ST), iron(III) chloride (FeCl 3 ), phosphotungstic acid (PT), and phosphomolybdic acid (PM) were tested as catalysts in different DESs. FeCl 3 was selected as the most promising for the next screening step. The results of such solvent screening are summarized in Table 5.Among the oxidation reactions catalyzed by FeCl 3 , oxidation of toluene into benzaldehyde is another important key transformation in the chemical industry, toluene being the cheapest and primary source of aromatic compounds.

        <p>The authors studied the intrinsic catalytic activity of DES but no reactivity was observed. Iron(III) chloride was the only catalyst able to promote the oxidation, presumably by a Fenton-like mechanism. The ETA-FeCl 3 system showed higher conversion (S Bzh = 73%, conv = 18%) when compared to the neat system (S Bzh = 69%, conv = 8.4%), but the URA-FeCl 3 couple was able to give the highest selectivity, despite lower conversion (S Bzh = 87%, conv = 5%). The authors investigated the temperature effect as well, observing conversion decreasing when reaching temperatures above 60 °C. This is probably due to the faster decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.The authors studied the intrinsic catalytic activity of DES but no reactivity was observed.

In particular, C-C bond formation through C-H activation is one of the great challenges in organic synthesis. 45 One example is the mechanism of C(sp3)-H bond activation at the α-position of nitrogen, which is well-known and proceeds through two consequent single electron transfer (SET) reactions generating an iminium intermediate, as shown in Scheme 3. 46 In this context, Zhang reported the synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines promoted by CuFeO 2 nanoparticles in DES. 47 In 2016, Ramón et al. presented for the first time the cross-dehydrogenative coupling between 1,2,3,4tetrahydroisoquinoline and phenylacetylene through C-H bond activation promoted by copper impregnated on magnetite (CuFeO 2 ) in DES using atmospheric oxygen as the oxidant. 48 The optimized reaction is shown in Scheme 4.Iron-based catalysis finds several applications in organic synthesis and C-C bond formation reactions are undoubtedly among key transformations due to their intrinsic capability to increase the framework complexity of molecules.

        <p>FeCl 3 also plays a crucial role in the synthesis of polymers in modern industrial chemistry. Some particular features of these materials are required nowadays, particularly in specific applications such as photoluminescence and electrochemistry. 49 For example, poly(3-alkylthione)s are a class of important polymers that exhibit electro-and photo properties, which make them attractive for manufacturing of semiconductor polymers and dyes. FeCl 3 oxidative polymerization is the protocol mainly adopted to prepare these polymers on a large-scale process, affording the desired product in high yield employing a low-cost catalyst. 50 In 2016, Lee and co-workers reported an efficient protocol to polymerize alkylthiophenes using FeCl 3 in DESs. 51 In their previous work they reported a similar protocol employing an IL (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluoroantimonate([BmIm] [SbF 6 ])) as a medium and they pointed out how replacing chloroform, the organic solvent commonly used, with the IL can have remarkable advantages in terms of polymer growth and yield. 52 Aware of the general benefits gained by substituting ILs with DESs the authors decided to investigate the transformation in DESs. Table 6 reports the results, which show the remarkable advantages given by DESs (up to 100% yield and M W of 44 179) compared to the outcome of the reaction performed in chloroform (yield = 87, M W = 34 672), in addition to their well-known intrinsic economic and sustainable aspects.FeCl 3 also plays a crucial role in the synthesis of polymers in modern industrial chemistry.

An interesting correlation between the basicity parameter and reactivity in different DESs was observed. The yield of P3OT was seen to increase with decreasing values of pH. A similar effect has already been observed in the polymerization of 3OT performed in ILs.

After examining the scope and limitation of this reaction, varying the substituents on the aromatic ring and finding that no detrimental effects were observed with both electron-poor and electron-rich rings, the authors carried out a subsequent investigation of the chemoselective reduction of the azido functional group. Classical reductive systems were tested such as Zn/ammonium formate, Zn/HCl, Zn/NH 4 Cl, Ph 3 P, and D-glucose/KOH without any significant results.

        <p>The authors found that the addition of an additive (benzoic acid) is crucial to obtain the desired product. Otherwise, the absence of the acid afforded a mixture of the corresponding aldehyde and nitrile. It is worth noting that substitution of classical organic solvents (entries 1, 2 and 3) with DESs significantly boosted the reactivity (entry 4 in Table 10). The authors rationalized this behavior, observing a better solubility of IBX in the DES compared to some organic solvents (DCM, CH 3 CN, toluene). After finding the optimized condition for the oxidation, the authors investigated its implementation in the Ugi reaction.

        <p>Fast and selective oxidation occurs smoothly not only for heterocyclic compounds. Recently, Capriati and co-workers disclosed a one-pot methodology to prepare αand β-hydroxy-phosphine oxides in a very short reaction time (Scheme 16). 66 The protocol consists of three steps. Firstly, the reactive lithium phosphide is generated by adding 1 equivalent of n-BuLi to a solution of phosphine in DES (ChCl : Gly, 1 : 2); the electrophile (epoxy or aldehyde) is then added, affording either the αor β-hydroxy-phosphine analogue, which spontaneously undergoes oxidation at the phosphorus centre in excellent yield (up to 95%). Surprisingly, the reaction works in DESs containing a HBD despite the lithium phosphide being well-known to be sensitive to moisture and incompatible with protic solvents. The authors investigated the fate of the lithium phosphide in the DES and observed a drastic decrease of reactivity by increasing the time lag between the n-BuLi addition and the electrophile addition. This suggests a detrimental effect of the solvent which is however not significant if the addition occurs fast.Fast and selective oxidation occurs smoothly not only for heterocyclic compounds.

        <p>When the recycling of the DESs is possible, the strategy of anchoring a catalyst or a reactivable reagent onto DESs can be an elegant way to carry out chemical reactions. In recent years, some protocols have been reported in this area. Shankarling et al. disclosed a method to selectively oxidize benzyl alcohol derivates to aldehydes in choline peroxydisulfate using ultrasound as the energy source. 67 The aim of the authors was to develop an environmentally benign oxidation reaction with high yield, facile to reproduce, and with minimization of energy requirements. They explored the oxidizing activity of the biodegradable choline peroxydisulfate (ChPS) (Scheme 17) comparing the energy consumption in the cases of thermal and ultrasound energy transfer. The preparation of the DES and a comparison with some common oxidative reactants has also been reported in a previous paper published by the same authors. 68 The authors chose benzyl alcohol as a model reactant and they found the optimal conditions using 2 equiv. of DES in water (2 M). The reaction occurred more easily under ultrasound conditions (5 min) compared with thermal conditions (30 min). They also compared their protocol with standard protocols reported in the literature (H 2 O 2 and Fe(DS) 3 , NaOCl, and FeCl 3 /HNO 3 ) and showed that their protocol was more efficient and sustainable. 68 The scope of the reaction was also investigated, proving the robustness of the procedure (Scheme 18). Fig. 5 shows the energy required (kJ) for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol per unit weight of the material consumed/ obtained (g) under thermal (conventional) and ultrasound The oxidative species is part of the DES (peroxydisulfate). 67 Scheme 18 Choline peroxydisulfate-promoted oxidation of benzyl alcohol derivates to aldehydes in ultrasound. 67 conditions. The total energy required per unit weight benzaldehyde synthesis was 0.958 kJ g -1 for the thermal method and 0.125 kJ g -1 for the ultrasound method, proving that the latter is more sustainable for this reaction.When the recycling of the DESs is possible, the strategy of anchoring a catalyst or a reactivable reagent onto DESs can be an elegant way to carry out chemical reactions.

Electron-rich aryl boronic acids exhibited high yield (90 to 96%), showing complete consumption of the reagents in five minutes, whereas electron-poor boronic acids required a longer reaction time (15 minutes) with lower yield (82 to 90%). The authors proposed a mechanism to explain the role of the DES as the catalyst (Scheme 22) in which the DES activates the hydrogen peroxide by polarization of the peroxide bond through hydrogen bonding.The authors explored the scope of the reaction using different aryl boronic acid compounds by varying the substituent on the aromatic ring.

        <p>In 2018, the Nagarkar's group reported the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids using H 2 O 2 in DESs. 72 The authors used benzaldehyde as a model substrate and found that by maintaining the reaction temperature at 50 °C in ChCl/urea the number of equivalents of hydrogen peroxide dramatically affected the reactivity. The conversion was seen to increase from 38% to 100% when moving from 1 equiv. to 1.5, respectively. Keeping the reaction running for more than 2 hours resulted in a drop of yield due to degradation of the benzoic acid previously formed. A comparative study showing the effect of replacing common solvents with the DESs was performed (Table 13). The recycling experiments showed that the activity within the DESs reaction media remained the same for five cycles.In 2018, the Nagarkar's group reported the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids using H 2 O 2 in DESs. 72 The authors used benzaldehyde as a model substrate and found that by maintaining the reaction temperature at 50 °C in ChCl/urea the number of equivalents of hydrogen peroxide dramatically affected the reactivity.

        <p>The preparation of organic acids, especially those used as bulk chemicals, from renewable resources is a very attractive topic nowadays. In this context, maleic acid and fumaric acid along with their anhydrides are well-known as important C 4 chemical intermediates within the chemical industry, such as resins, lubricant additives, surface coatings and pharmaceuticals. In 2013 Yan and co-workers disclosed a protocol to convert furfural, one of the most important intermediates which comes from lignocellulose, into maleic and fumaric acid employing ChCl-oxalic acid DESs as both solvent and catalyst (Scheme 20). 73 Carboxylic acids play a crucial role in the oxidation of furfural due to their capability to be oxidized to organic peracids by H 2 O 2 and then efficiently oxidize furfural to maleic acid and fumaric acid. Based on this observation, the authors designed a DES with one organic acid that can catalyze the reaction. They selected oxalic acid as the key component of the DES due to its strong acidity (pK a = 1.13). A conversion of 100% of furfural into maleic and fumaric acid was achieved in six hours under mild conditions (50-60 °C).The preparation of organic acids, especially those used as bulk chemicals, from renewable resources is a very attractive topic nowadays.
