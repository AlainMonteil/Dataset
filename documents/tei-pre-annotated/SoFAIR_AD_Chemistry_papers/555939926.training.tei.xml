        <p>For mixture separations, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of practical interest. Such separations are carried out in fixed bed adsorption devices that are commonly operated in a transient mode, utilizing the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology, consisting of adsorption and desorption cycles. The primary objective of this article is to provide an assessment of the variety of metrics that are appropriate for screening and ranking MOFs for use in fixed bed adsorbers. By detailed analysis of several mixture separations of industrial significance, it is demonstrated that besides the adsorption selectivity, the performance of a specific MOF in PSA separation technologies is also dictated by a number of factors that include uptake capacities, intracrystalline diffusion influences, and regenerability. Low uptake capacities often reduce the efficacy of separations of MOFs with high selectivities. A combined selectivity-capacity metric, Δq, termed as the separation potential and calculable from ideal adsorbed solution theory, quantifies the maximum productivity of a component that can be recovered in either the adsorption or desorption cycle of transient fixed bed operations. As a result of intracrystalline diffusion limitations, the transient breakthroughs have distended characteristics, leading to diminished productivities in a number of cases. This article also highlights the possibility of harnessing intracrystalline diffusion limitations to reverse the adsorption selectivity; this strategy is useful for selective capture of nitrogen from natural gas.For mixture separations, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of practical interest.

        <p>During the last 2 decades, there has been a substantial increase in the development and synthesis of novel microporous crystalline materials for use as selective adsorbents in a variety of industrially important separation applications; examples of such materials include metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), porous organic cages, porous aromatic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and polymers with intrinsic microporosity. Such separations are normally carried out in fixed bed devices that are operated in a transient mode, consisting of adsorption and desorption cycles. In one class of applications, the motivation has been to afford energy-efficient and environmentally benign alternatives to conventional separations such as absorption, distillation, extraction, or crystallization. In other cases, there are incentives for enhancing the separation performance by replacing the currently used microporous adsorbents such as cationexchanged zeolites and activated carbon (AC) with tailormade MOFs. To set the scene and define the objectives of this article, we consider a number of mixture separations that may be targeted for the development of novel MOFs.During the last 2 decades, there has been a substantial increase in the development and synthesis of novel microporous crystalline materials for use as selective adsorbents in a variety of industrially important separation applications; examples of such materials include metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), porous organic cages, porous aromatic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and polymers with intrinsic microporosity.

        <p>Arguably, the most important and successful industrial application of adsorption separations is for H 2 purification. The catalytic reforming of natural gas, when combined with a water gas shift reaction step, yields a hydrogen-rich product stream containing a number of impurities such as H 2 O vapor, CO 2 , CH 4 , CO, and N 2 . [1][2][3] These impurities must be removed in order to attain the 99.95%+ H 2 purity that is normally demanded. 1 In fuel cell applications, the purity demands are as high as 99.99%+. 2,4 Large-scale production of hydrogen, with the desired purity, is carried out in pressure swing adsorption (PSA) units that are operated at pressures reaching about 7 MPa using the Skarstrom cycle, involving multiple steps or stages; see the schematic in Figure 1. In the simplest case, the four steps in the sequence are as follows. [5][6][7] (a) Pressurization (with the feed or raffinate product) (b) High-pressure adsorption separation with the feed, with withdrawal of the purified raffinate product (c) Depressurization, or "blowdown", countercurrent to the feed (d) Desorption at the lower operating pressure. This is accomplished by evacuation or purging the bed with a portion of the purified raffinate product. The use of layered beds, consisting of three different adsorbents, is an important characteristic of the currently employed PSA technology for H 2 purification. 2,8 In order to rationalize and understand the use of multilayer adsorbent beds, Figure 2a,b presents simulations of transient breakthroughs of 73/4/3/4/16 H 2 /N 2 /CO/CH 4 /CO 2 mixture, typical of steam methane reformer off-gas, 3 in fixed bed adsorbers packed with (a) AC and (b) LTA-5A zeolite [8][9][10] operating at 2 MPa total pressure and temperature T = 313 K. Purified H 2 can be recovered during the time intervals between the breakthroughs of H 2 and N 2 , as indicated by the arrows. The stronger binding of N 2 in LTA-5A, as compared to AC, is due to the contribution of the quadrupole moment of N 2 and its interaction with the charges of extraframework cations Na + and Ca 2+ . 5,11 The quadrupole moment of CO 2 also leads to stronger binding in LTA-5A, causing significantly higher CO 2 capture capacity, as evidenced by the strongly delayed breakthrough of CO 2 with LTA-5A as compared to AC. 5,11 The strong binding of CO 2 in LTA-5A is disadvantageous because deep vacuum will be required to reduce the CO 2 loading to the desired level during the purge step (d) in Figure 1. Consequently, despite the superior separation performance of LTA-5A, resulting in higher productivity of pure H 2 per kilogram of adsorbent, LTA-5A is not used on its own in the currently used PSA schemes. 2,3 Commonly, the first layer is either alumina or silica that retains the water vapor. Then, an AC layer is used to selectively adsorb CO 2 . The main task of the alumina and AC layers is to prevent the H 2 O vapor and CO 2 from reaching the zeolite layer. 2 The last layer is a cation-exchanged zeolite [such as LTA-5A, and NaX (=13X), 12 with Na + cations] with enhanced capacity for CO and N 2 .

        <p>For CO 2 capture from flue gases from power plants, and from natural gas streams, MOFs offer energy-efficient alternatives to conventionally used amine absorption technologies. [16][17][18][19][20][21] In CO 2 /flue gas and CO 2 /natural gas separations, the process economics would demand high CO 2 capture capacity and concomitant ease of regeneration. 22 For the production of alkene feedstocks of 99.95%+ purity required for polymerization reactors, cryogenic distillation columns, operated at high pressures and high reflux ratios, are commonly employed for large-scale separations of C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 and C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8 mixtures. Many MOF developments have targeted alkene/alkane separations with the objective of eventually supplanting the energy-intensive distillation technologies. [23][24][25][26][27][28][29] Process economics would also demand high alkene productivities per kilogram adsorbent.For CO 2 capture from flue gases from power plants, and from natural gas streams, MOFs offer energy-efficient alternatives to conventionally used amine absorption technologies.

        <p>In steam cracking of ethane to produce ethene (C 2 H 4 ), one of the byproducts is ethyne (C 2 H 2 ). Typically, the C 2 H 2 content of C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 feed mixtures is 1%. Ethyne has a deleterious effect on the polymer products of ethene, such as polyethene.

        <p>Ethyne (C 2 H 2 ) is an important building block in industrial chemical synthesis and is also widely used as a fuel in welding equipment. C 2 H 2 is commonly manufactured by the partial combustion of CH 4 or comes from cracking of hydrocarbons. In the reactor product, C 2 H 2 coexists with CO 2 or C 2 H 4 . Because of the similarity of molecular sizes and shapes (C 2 H 2 : 3.32 × 3.34 × 5.7 Å 3 and CO 2 : 3.18 × 3.33 × 5.36 Å 3 ), the separation of C 2 H 2 /CO 2 mixtures is particularly challenging. 38,39 Because the boiling points of C 2 H 2 (189.3 K) and CO 2 (194.7 K) are close, distillation separations need to operate at cryogenic temperatures and high pressures. A number of recently developed MOFs offer the potential of use in adsorptive separations of C 2 H 2 /CO 2 mixtures. [40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53] The selective capture of CO 2 from the reactor effluents from the process for oxidative coupling of methane essentially requires for CO 2 -selective separation of CO 2 /CH 4 /C 2 H 4 / C 2 H 6 mixtures; the number of candidate adsorbent materials is surprisingly limited. [54][55][56] Noble gases such as He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe find a variety of applications. 57 For example, heliox (a mixture of He and O 2 ) is used for patients with respiratory difficulties and in deep-sea diving, 58 Ne is used in the familiar "neon sign" for advertisements. Kr and Xe are used in flash bulbs and lasers. Ar is used in filament bulbs and in electric arc welding as a shielding gas. Based on the differences in the boiling points, Ne (27 K), Ar (87 K), Kr (120 K), and Xe (165 K) are commercially produced by liquefaction of air, followed by cryogenic distillation.

Briefly, the assumptions made in the simulations are as follows: (1) axial dispersion effects are considered to be negligible, (2) the mixture adsorption equilibrium can be described using IAST, (3) the column pressure drop is of negligible importance, and (4) the total pressure remains constant during the operation. Because the breakthrough times are dependent on the mass of the adsorbent, m ads , and the volumetric flow rate, Q 0 , the appropriate comparison of transient breakthroughs for different MOFs is ACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Perspective to use the parameter Q 0 t/m ads as the x-axis in place of time; indeed, this parameter may be viewed as a "corrected" time. It is also a common practice to use the value of Q 0 at STP conditions. Noteworthily, the breakthroughs of both Ag@NiMOF-74 and CoFormate have distended characteristics. Because of intra-crystalline diffusion limitations, the breakthrough characteristics of CoFormate are more distended than that of Ag@NiMOF-74.Because the productivity of pure Kr, Δq, is proportional to the displacement time interval, Δt = t 1t 2 , an alternative procedure for screening MOFs for Xe/Kr separations would be on the basis of the displacement intervals, determined by comparing transient breakthroughs in fixed beds, that are determined from experimental data or transient breakthrough simulations.

        <p>In the industry, the process requirement would demand the production of Kr containing &lt;1000 ppm Xe. During the displacement intervals indicated by the arrows, the industrial process requirements may be met. 57 To determine the actual amount of Kr of desired purity that may be recovered, the total amount of Kr that exits the fixed bed during the displacement interval is determined by sampling of the exit gas from the fixed bed; from such sampling, the productivities of pure Kr are 125 L (STP) kg -1 for Ag@NiMOF-74 and 68 L (STP) kg -1 for CoFormate. Despite having the highest S ads value, the significantly poorer productivity of CoFormate is directly ascribable to its lower uptake capacity (cf. Figure 5a). The MOF crystallites in the fixed bed at the end of the adsorption cycle are predominantly rich in the more strongly adsorbing Xe. Pure Xe can be recovered during the desorption cycle by the application of deep vacuum. The maximum productivity of pure Xe can also be derived from the use of the shock wave model 63 Figure 11.

The relation between the actual productivities (symbols) and Δq is not perfectly linear. For example, the Xe productivity of CoFormate is slightly lower than that of CuBTC, despite the fact that the separation potential Δq of CoFormate is higher than that of CuBTC.

        <p>For the nine selected MOFs, Figure 8a,b presents the IAST calculations of (a) component loadings q 2 versus q 1 and (b) separation potential Δ = - q q q y y 1 2 of the desired purity can be recovered from the gas mixture exiting the fixed bed. For a desired purity of 99%+, the amount of C 2 H 2 that is recoverable can be determined from a material balance on the adsorber. These productivity values, expressed as L of the desired product (at STP) per kilogram of adsorbent in the packed bed, for the nine different MOFs are plotted in Figure 8d as the y-axis. The x-axis in Figure 8d is the separation potential, Δq, calculated using eq 7 with y 10 = y 20 = 0.5, which represents the maximum C 2 H 2 productivity that is achievable if the concentration "fronts" traversed the column in the form of shock waves during the desorption cycle. We note that the productivities determined from the transient breakthrough simulations (denoted as symbols) are near linearly related to Δq. Also shown by the continuous solid line in Figure 8d mixtures are a series of threedimensional (3D) coordination networks composed of inorganic anions of (SiF 6 ) 2-(hexafluorosilicate, SIFSIX). 30 The pore sizes within this family of SIFSIX materials can be systematically tuned by changing the length of the organic (=pyridine) linkers, the metal (=Cu, Ni, or Zn) node, and/or the framework interpenetration.

From a material balance on the adsorber, we can determine the productivity of purified C 2 H 4 , containing less than 40 ppm. The productivity of pure C 2 H 4 is found to be a near-linear function of the separation potential Δq determined from IAST; see Figure 9b. The highest productivity is obtained with SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (2 = 4,4′-dipyridylacetylene and i = interpenetrated); 30 Figure 9c compares the separation potentials of SIFSIX-2-Cui and SIFSIX-1-Cu as a function of the % C 2 H 2 in the feed mixture. While the interpenetrated SIFSIX-2-Cu-i has the superior performance for feed compositions below 5% C 2 H 2 , SIFSIX-1-Cu, with a more open structure, has the better separation capability at higher % C 2 H 2 in feed; this trend is verified in the experiments reported by Cui et al. 30 2.4.

The masses of the adsorbents in the packed tube are not the same for each MOF, and therefore, their experimental data have been replotted in Figure 10a using Q 0 t/m ads as the x-axis. For each of the five materials, there is a displacement interval (indicated by the arrows) during which purified CH 4 can be recovered. The CH 4 productivities follow the hierarchy Mg 2 (dobdc) &gt; Co 2 (dobdc) &gt; MIL-100(Cr) &gt; AC. Figure 10b presents a plot of productivity of 95%+ pure CH 4 as a function of the separation potential Δq = q 1 y 20 /y 10q 2 .

        <p>Bhadra 70,74 have developed a detailed mathematical model for a PSA scheme for purification of natural gas using Ba-ETS-4, using the steps shown in Figure 11. In this scheme, the inclusion of the cocurrent blowdown step (suggested by Jayaraman et al. 72 for N 2 /CH 4 mixture separations with clinoptilolites) increases the CH 4 recovery. At the end of the countercurrent blowdown step, the bed contains both nitrogen (fast diffusing) and methane (slow diffusing). Thus, if the bed is simply closed at one end and left for a period of time, the nitrogen will diffuse out first, followed by methane, so the system is, in effect, self-purging (fifth step in the sequence).Bhadra 70,74 have developed a detailed mathematical model for a PSA scheme for purification of natural gas using Ba-ETS-4, using the steps shown in Figure 11.

        <p>In a recent article, Yoon et al. 75 have reported that MIL-100(Cr), activated at 523 K, shows adsorption selectivity in favor of N 2 . However, an important disadvantage of this material for use in natural gas purification is that CH 4 is not completely excluded. Figure 12 compares the transient breakthrough of 20/ 80 N 2 (1)/CH 4 (2) mixtures in a fixed bed adsorber packed with MIL-100(Cr) and Ba-ETS-4, operating at 283 K and total pressure p t = 1 MPa. We note that the breakthrough of CH 4 occurs significantly later than that with BaETS-4, implying that a significant amount of CH 4 gets adsorbed. Consequently, even after cocurrent blowdown, a significant proportion of CH 4 will remain in the void spaces of the fixed bed packed with MIL-100(Cr) and will be "lost" along with N 2 in the final blowdown step; this implies that recovery of 96%+ pure CH 4 is likely to be unacceptably low with MIL-100(Cr). Candidate adsorbents for N 2 /CH 4 separations must disallow the ingress of CH 4 inside the pores.In a recent article, Yoon et al. 75 have reported that MIL-100(Cr), activated at 523 K, shows adsorption selectivity in favor of N 2 .

Propene is a byproduct from the steam cracking of liquid feedstocks such as naphtha and liquefied petroleum gas, as well as off-gases produced in fluid catalytic cracking units in refineries. The key processing steps for preparing feedstocks for polymer production are the separations of C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 and C 3 H 6 / C 3 H 8 mixtures, which are traditionally carried out in distillation columns. Because of small differences in the boiling points, the relative volatilities of C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 and C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8 separations are in the range 1.1-1.2. In order to satisfy the 99.95%+ purity requirement of alkene feedstocks to polymerization reactors, the distillation columns are tall (150-200 trays) and operate at cryogenic temperatures, high pressures, and high reflux ratios (≈15).

        <p>Each of the unsaturated alkenes C 2 H 4 and C 3 H 6 possesses a πbond, and the preferential adsorption of alkene from the corresponding alkane with the same number of C atoms can be achieved by choosing zeolitic adsorbents with extraframework cations [e.g., LTA-4A zeolite 76,77 and NaX (=13X) zeolite 76,78 ] An important disadvantage of the alkene/alkane separations with the adsorbents listed above is that the desired alkene product, required for the production of polymer-grade feedstock, can only be recovered in the desorption phase. In practice, it becomes necessary to operate with multiple beds involving five different steps, as schematized in Figure 13; the C 3 H 6 product of the desired purity is recovered in the final step by countercurrent vacuum blowdown. 77,78,81 The recovery of high-purity C 3 H 6 product in the final vacuum blowdown step is expected to be enhanced if C 3 H 8 is (almost) excluded during the high-pressure adsorption cycle. Near-total exclusion of C 3 H 8 is achievable by kinetically based separations using cage-type zeolites with eightring windows such as CHA and LTA-4A zeolites. 81,82 An alternative is to employ a customized MOF such as NbOFFIVE-1-Ni (=KAUST-7) with pyrazine as the organic linker. 24 The use of bulkier (NbOF 5 ) 2-pillars causes tilting of the pyrazine molecule on the linker, resulting in an effective aperture of 0.30 nm. This reduced aperture permits ingress of the smaller C 3 H 6 molecules but practically excludes C 3 H 8 , relying on subtle differences in bond lengths and bond angles. Because of the significantly lower diffusivity of C 3 H 8 , the desorption process is self-purging. 7,83 In the last step shown in Figure 13, if the bed is simply closed at the one end and left for a period of time, C 3 H 6 will diffuse out first, followed by C 3 H 8 .

        <p>For C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 separations, near-total exclusion of C 2 H 6 is achieved by use of ultramicroporous MOF [Ca(C 4 O 4 )(H 2 O)] that possesses rigid one-dimensional (1D) channels. 25 The 1D channels are of similar size to C 2 H 4 molecules (all atoms of which lie on the same plane), but owing to the size, shape, and rigidity of the pores, they practically exclude C 2 H 6 .For C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 separations, near-total exclusion of C 2 H 6 is achieved by use of ultramicroporous MOF [Ca(C 4 O 4 )(H 2 O)] that possesses rigid one-dimensional (1D) channels. 25 The 1D channels are of similar size to C 2 H 4 molecules (all atoms of which lie on the same plane), but owing to the size, shape, and rigidity of the pores, they practically exclude C 2 H 6 .</p>
        <p>For C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 separations, a number of microporous adsorbents such as Fe 2 (O 2 )(dobdc), 28 Cu(Qc) 2 , 84 MUF-15, 85 PCN-250, 86 ZIF-7, 87,88 ZIF-8, 89,90 IRMOF-8, 91 Ni(bdc)-(ted) 0.5 , 92 MAF-49, 91 CPM-233, 26 and CPM-733 26 adsorb the saturated alkane selectively exploiting the differences in van der Waals interactions, resulting from the higher polarizability of C 2 H 6 . Figure 15a presents the IAST calculations of the C 2 H 6 uptake q 2 versus the separation selectivity S ads of 90/10 C 2 H 4 / C 2 H 6 mixture adsorption at 298 K and 100 kPa in four different MOFs. The hierarchy of separation selectivities is Cu(Qc) 2 &gt; CPM-733 ≈ MUF-15 &gt; CPM-233. However, because of the higher C 2 H 6 uptake capacity of CPM-733, the separation 15c. This implies that the IAST calculations of Δq = q 1 y 20 /y 10q 2 are appropriate metrics for screening and ranking MOFs. 2.7. Separation of Hexane Isomers. The values of the research octane number (RON) of alkane isomers increase with the degree of branching. For hexane isomers, for example, the RON values are n-hexane (nC6) = 30; 2-methylpentane (2MP) = 74.5; 3-methylpentane (3MP) = 75.5; 2,2 dimethylbutane (22DMB) = 94; and 2,3 dimethylbutane (23DMB) = 105. Consequently, dibranched alkane isomers are preferred blending components in high-octane gasoline. 90,93,94 As shown in the process scheme in Figure 16a, alkane isomers are currently separated on the basis of molecular sieving using LTA-5A zeolite. Linear alkanes can hop from one cage to the adjacent cage through the 4 Å windows of LTA-5A, but monobranched and dibranched alkanes are largely excluded. From an industrial perspective, it is desirable to adopt an alternative separation scheme (see Figure 16b) using an adsorbent that has the capability of separating the dibranched isomers from the linear and monobranched isomers that may be recycled back to the isomerization reactor.For C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 separations, a number of microporous adsorbents such as Fe 2 (O 2 )(dobdc), 28 Cu(Qc) 2 , 84 MUF-15, 85 PCN-250, 86 ZIF-7, 87,88 ZIF-8, 89,90 IRMOF-8, 91 Ni(bdc)-(ted) 0.5 , 92 MAF-49, 91 CPM-233, 26 and CPM-733 26 adsorb the saturated alkane selectively exploiting the differences in van der Waals interactions, resulting from the higher polarizability of C 2 H 6 .

        <p>One candidate MOF that can be employed as an adsorbent in Figure 16b is Fe 2 (BDP) 3 [BDP 2-= benzenedipyrazolate] that possesses one-dimensional triangular shape channels of 4.9 Å. 93 Simulations of transient breakthroughs of hexane isomers using Fe 2 (BDP) 3 are shown in Figure 17a; the hierarchy of breakthroughs is dibranched, monobranched, and linear isomers; this hierarchy is dictated by a combination of adsorption strengths, dictated essentially by van der Waals interactions (nC6 ≫ 2MP ≈ 3MP ≫ 22DMB ≈ 23DMB), and diffusivities (nC6 &gt; 2MP ≈ 3MP &gt; 22DMB ≈ 23DMB). The RON of the product gas mixture exiting the adsorber is plotted in Figure 17b. During a certain time interval, the 92+ RON product can be recovered for incorporation into the gasoline pool. This requirement of 92+ RON implies that the product stream will contain predominantly the dibranched isomers 22DMB and 23DMB, while allowing a small proportion of 2MP and 3MP to be incorporated into the product stream. Also shown in Figure 17b, for comparison purposes, is the corresponding breakthrough simulation data for ZIF-77 94 that has a characteristic pore dimension of 4.5 Å. Because of stronger diffusional limitations in ZIF-77, the 92+ RON productivity of ZIF-77 is significantly lower than that of Fe 2 (BDP) 3 ; this is evidenced by the significantly shorter time interval during which 92+ RON product can be recovered.One candidate MOF that can be employed as an adsorbent in Figure 16b is Fe 2 (BDP) 3 [BDP 2-= benzenedipyrazolate] that possesses one-dimensional triangular shape channels of 4.9 Å. 93 Simulations of transient breakthroughs of hexane isomers using Fe 2 (BDP) 3 are shown in Figure 17a; the hierarchy of breakthroughs is dibranched, monobranched, and linear isomers; this hierarchy is dictated by a combination of adsorption strengths, dictated essentially by van der Waals interactions (nC6 ≫ 2MP ≈ 3MP ≫ 22DMB ≈ 23DMB), and diffusivities (nC6 &gt; 2MP ≈ 3MP &gt; 22DMB ≈ 23DMB).

        <p>2.8. Separation of C8 Aromatics. The xylene isomers, oxylene, m-xylene, and in particular p-xylene, are important chemical intermediates. Xylenes, along with other aromatic hydrocarbons, are commonly obtained from catalytic reforming of naphtha, as illustrated in the process scheme in Figure 18. 63,95,96 The products of catalytic reformer are fed to a distillation column called the reformate splitter. The bottom product of the reformate splitter, rich in xylenes, is further distilled in the xylene splitter, whose bottom product consists of C9+ aromatics. The recovery of p-xylene from the mixture of C8 aromatics (typically composition: 20% o-xylene, 44% m-xylene, 17% p-xylene, and 19% ethylbenzene) in the overhead product of the xylene splitter is the focus of attention in this section.2.8.

        <p>Because of the very small differences in boiling points (cf. Figure 19), p-xylene recovery by use of distillation technology is not feasible. Two different technologies are currently in use for recovery of p-xylene: (a) fractional crystallization and (b) selective adsorption. Fractional crystallization relies on the differences in freezing points (cf. Figure 19). The freezing point of p-xylene is significantly higher than that of other C8 aromatics; on cooling, therefore, pure p-xylene crystals are the first to emerge from the solution. Selective adsorption of pxylene from liquid-phase mixtures of C8 aromatics is achieved with cation-exchange FAU zeolite adsorbent, such as BaX, in a simulated moving bed (SMB) adsorption device. [97][98][99] The hierarchy of adsorption strengths in BaX is dictated by molecular packing, or entropy, effects that prevail under pore saturation conditions in liquid-phase SMB separations. 95,[97][98][99][100] Unlike PSA technologies for gaseous separations, the SMB process operates continuously under steady-state conditions; see the schematic in Figure 20.Because of the very small differences in boiling points (cf.

Improved MOF adsorbents will result in lower recirculation flows of eluent, and microporous adsorbent in the SMB unit, and this will result in significant economic advantages.

Figure 21 presents the plot of Δq versus p-xylene uptake for a few selected MOFs. The highest value of the separation potential is offered by DynaMOF-100 that is a Zn(II)-based dynamic coordination framework that undergoes guest-induced structural changes so as to allow selective uptake of p-xylene ACS Omega within the cavities. A slightly lower separation potential is offered by Co-CUK-1 that is composed of cobalt(II) cations and the dianion of dicarboxylic acid; the 1D zigzag-shaped channels of Co-CUK-1 allow optimal vertical stacking of p-xylene. Both these MOFs offer separation potentials about three to four times that achievable by BaX; there is a need for experimental verification of this expectation.In eq 8, the molar loadings of each of the four C8 aromatics, q i , expressed in mol per kilogram of crystalline adsorbent are calculated using the IAST for mixture adsorption equilibrium.

        <p>2.9. Influence of Thermodynamic Nonidealities in Mixture Adsorption. In many cases, the IAST fails to provide a quantitatively correct description of mixture adsorption equilibrium and thus thermodynamic nonidealities come into play. Thermodynamic nonidealities are evidenced for water/ alcohol mixtures because of molecular clustering engendered by hydrogen bonding. [112][113][114][115][116][117] Thermodynamic nonidealities also arise because of preferential location of CO 2 molecules at the window regions of eight-ring zeolites such as DDR, CHA, ERI, LTA-4A, and LTA-5A. 55,56,[117][118][119] For CO 2 capture with NaX zeolite, there is congregation of CO 2 around the cations, resulting in failure of IAST. 117,119 Thermodynamic nonidealities can be strong enough to cause selectivity reversals for CO 2 / hydrocarbon mixture adsorption in cation-exchanged zeolites. 55,56,117 Framework flexibility and gate-opening behaviors may lead to failure of IAST. 120 In all the aforementioned cases, we need to use the real adsorbed solution theory (RAST) for quantitative description of mixture adsorption in transient breakthrough simulations. RAST calculations of Δq may be used for screening purposes. 116,1192.9. Influence of Thermodynamic Nonidealities in Mixture Adsorption.

        <p>(2) The separation potential Δq, which is calculable on the basis of IAST, provides a simple and convenient metric to screen and rank the separation capability of MOFs. For a component that is recovered in pure form during the adsorption cycle, Δq can be calculated using eq 2, which is derived using the shock wave model. For a component that is recovered in pure form during the blowdown cycle, the separation potential Δq is defined by eq 7. The value of Δq defines the upper limit to the achievable separations in fixed bed units. The actual separations in fixed bed adsorbers will be lower than the IAST-calculated Δq values because of distended breakthroughs. (3) The composition of the feed mixture may have a significant influence on the separation potential of the MOF; this is illustrated in Figure 9c for C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 mixtures. (4) Broadly speaking, high product purities are more difficult to achieve if the desired product is recovered in the In such cases, it is advantageous to have MOF adsorbents that virtually exclude the less strongly adsorbing component because this facilitates the achievement of high-purity products. The productivity calculations are very sensitive to intracrystalline diffusion limitations, as illustrated in Figure 14 for C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8 mixture separations using KAUST-7. ( 5) The concept of separation potential is particularly advantageous for multicomponent separations; several selectivities and uptake capacities are incorporated into one combined metric that quantifies the desired separation task. For example, eq 8 is the appropriate expression for Δq for separation of four-component mixture of C8 aromatics (6) As illustrated in Figures 5, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 17, transient breakthrough experiments or simulations can be directly used to compare the separation effectiveness of MOFs. In such cases, the appropriate x-axis for plotting purposes is Q 0 t/m ads ; this parameter may be viewed as "corrected" time. Such comparisons are indispensable for comparison and screening of MOFs that are subject to severe diffusion limitations, 90,121 (7) For situations in which the intracrystalline influences are strong, the separation performance will be significantly lowered and IAST calculations of Δq will not be adequate for screening purposes. (8) For kinetically driven separation, as used industrially for N 2 /CH 4 and N 2 /O 2 mixtures, some authors have suggested the use of Đ Đ / 1 2 as a metric to quantify kinetic influences. 71,81 The concept of the separation potential Δq is not of relevance in such cases.(2) The separation potential Δq, which is calculable on the basis of IAST, provides a simple and convenient metric to screen and rank the separation capability of MOFs.
