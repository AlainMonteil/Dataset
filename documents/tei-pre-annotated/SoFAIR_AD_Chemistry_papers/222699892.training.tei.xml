        <p>Abstract：Coal is a major contributor to the global emission of nitrogen oxides. The NOx formation during coal utilisation typically derives from thermal decomposition of N-containing compounds pyrrole, which usually combines with an aromatic ring in the form of indole. NH3 and HCN are common precursors of NOx from the decomposition of N-containing compounds. In this study, possible pathways of indole pyrolysis to form HCN and NH3 are investigated using the density functional theory (DFT) method.</p>
        <p>Calculation results indicate that indole pyrolysis has two type of possible initial reactions, which are internal hydrogen transfer and hydrogen homolysis reaction, respectively. The initial reaction mode of indole has a great impact on the subsequent pyrolysis pathway.</p>
        <p>Additionally, it is shown that indole can produce two nitrogen-containing products, i.e. HCN and NH3. Five pathways will result in the formation of HCN (path-1, path-3, patha, path-b, path-c), and another two pathways will lead to the NH3 (path-2, path-4).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, among all the reaction mechanisms of indole pyrolysis, the path-1 is the optimal reaction pathway. During which, indole is converted to a diradical intermediate, then the intermediate undergoes a synergy ring-opening transition state to form a new intermediate. Afterwards, the new intermediate decomposes into CN by homolysis of the C-C bond.</p>
        <p>Coal usage is the main sources of nitrogen oxide (NO, NO2, N2O) in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Nitrogen oxide is not only the main precursor of acid rain formation, but also has a severe greenhouse effect which is 260 times that of CO2 [1]. Nitrogen species exist in coal in many forms. The chemical structure of coal is inlaid with organic macromolecules, mainly composed of aromatic rings, bond bridges and functional groups (Wiser model [2], Shinn model [3]). As a matter of fact, the Wiser model along with "structural alternative" carbon skeletal representations, had an increasing scale, representing the rank transition from 76% C to 90% C (wt % basis) [2] . The Shinn model was created at a larger scale, in which three relatively small unconnected molecular entities were held within a larger molecule [3].</p>
        <p>Three types of N-containing compounds exist in coal: pyrrole-N, pyridine-N, and quaternary-N. The dominant nitrogen source in coal is the pyrrole type, which accounts for 50-80 wt.% of total nitrogen [4]. Pyrrole is not presented in coal alone [3], usually combines with an aromatic ring in the form of carbazole, indole or napthazole [5].</p>
        <p>Consequently, merely studying the mechanism of pyrrole pyrolysis [6] is not comprehensive to reveal the formation mechanism of NOx pollutant precursors. In fact, nitrogen has been found in coal and coal tar in the form of indole [7,8]. Moreover, Yamamoto et al. [9] have extracted the indole and its derivatives from coal tar as platform compouds. It should be noted that indole has a stable structure composed by benzene and pyrrole. Furthermore, indole is difficult to decompose during the pyrolysis process of coal.</p>
        <p>Therefore, studying the indole pyrolysis reaction mechanism is crucial for understanding the formation and control of NOx.</p>
        <p>The research on the mechanism of indole pyrolysis is mainly through the experimental method. Corval et al. [10] investigated the mechanism of indole pyrolysis to form HCN by carbon labelling. The results suggested that indole decomposition is a complex isomerization process, which provides evidence for the mechanisms of HCN elimination. Moreover, Ren et al. [11] reported that the coal-N (nitrogen in coal) model compound indole can form HCN when the reaction reached the temperature threshold. In addition, Laskin et al. [12] studied the mechanism of indole pyrolysis by combining experimental and molecular dynamics methods, studies have described the pyrolysis mechanism of indole. However, the experimental and molecular dynamics studies follow the macro-Newtonian mechanics, so the reaction mechanism cannot be clear at the quantum level.</p>
        <p>With the advance of computational density theory, progresses have been made in the mechanism study of indole pyrolysis. Zhou et al. [13] explored the pyrolysis mechanism of indole by density functional theory, focusing on the mechanism of indole open loop reaction. It is believed that the structure of benzene is more stable than that of pyrrole during the pyrolysis reaction of indole [14]. As a result, the indole pyrolysis reaction begins from the pyrrole ring opening reaction.</p>
        <p>It has been identified that HCN and NH3, generated during coal utilization under high temperature, are the main precursors of NOx [15,16]. Hence, the thermal decomposition of N-containing model compounds to NH3 and HCN is important for understanding NOx formation. However, limited studies have been reported focusing on the formation mechanism of NOx pollutant precursor by coal-N model compound indole pyrolysis.</p>
        <p>Therefore, in this study, the density functional theory (DFT) method was applied to investigate the detailed pyrolysis mechanism of indole to HCN and NH3, which may help with the development of coal pyrolysis/combustion technologies for NOx control.</p>
        <p>All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program [17]. The equilibrium geometries of the reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products were optimized by the density functional theory (DFT) computational method and employing B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) basis set. The Becke's three-parameter hybrid functional combined with the Lee, Yang, and Parr correlation functional B3LYP [18] run with the 6-31G(d, p) basis set [19] has been successfully applied to investigate the pyrolysis mechanism of pyrrole model compounds [20,21]. In this work, the optimized structures of the reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products were further evaluated by frequency analysis, adopting the same method and basis set as the structural optimization calculations. The results of a frequency analysis were used to verify the stationary points to be minimal or first-order saddle points and to obtain their thermodynamic parameters. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were further performed to ensure the corresponding minimal and firstorder saddle point on the same potential energy surface. Enthalpies were used for the discussion on energetics, under the standard conditions of 298.15 K and 1 atm [22].</p>
        <p>Indole is a heterocyclic organic compound with the formula C8H7N. The optimized molecular structure of indole is shown in Figure 1. All carbon atoms are marked with numbers for convenient expression.</p>
        <p>Early studies have mentioned [12,23,24] that the initial reaction type of indole thermal decomposition can be divided into two types. One is indole internal hydrogen transfer reaction, the other is the homolysis reaction on the indole ring. The hydrogen transfer reaction can destroy the stability of the pyrrole ring in indole to facilitate subsequent reactions. There are eight possible ways for this type of reaction, which are the hydrogen on C5 transferred to C1, the hydrogen on C3 transferred to C1, the hydrogen on N transferred to C1, the hydrogen on N transferred to C7, the hydrogen on C7 transferred to N, the hydrogen on C7 transferred to C8, the hydrogen on C8 transferred to C7, the hydrogen on C8 transferred to C2. Among all these reactions, there are four possibilities for the subsequent path generating product to be HCN or NH3, as shown in Figure 2. The four reactions are the hydrogen on C7 transferred to C8 (reaction-1), the hydrogen on C8 transferred to C7 (reaction-2), the hydrogen on N transferred to C1 (reaction-3), and the hydrogen on N transferred to C7 (reaction-4).</p>
        <p>homolysis. There are three possibilities to finally generate HCN or NH3, namely, reaction-a (the homolytic cleavage of N-H bond), reaction-b (the homolytic cleavage of C7-H bond) and reaction-c (the homolytic cleavage of C8-H bond).</p>
        <p>Firstly, hydrogen transfer is used as an initial mode to induce indole thermal decomposition. As shown in Figure 2, the reaction-1 activation energy is 260.9 kJ/mol; the activation energy of the reaction from indole to indole-2 is 302.76 kJ/mol; the activation energy of the internal hydrogen transfer process indole→indole-3 is 226.92 kJ/mol; the activation energy from indole to indole-4 is 367.14 kJ/mol.</p>
        <p>Secondly, the homolytic cleavage of C-H or N-H bond serves as an initial reaction, which can destroy the stability of indole structure, and then trigger subsequent dissociation.</p>
        <p>As shown in Figure 2, the homolytic dissociation enthalpy of N-H bond is calculated to be 372.95 kJ/mol. In the reaction of indole→indole-b, the homolytic cleavage of C7-H bond is considerably less favourable, with an activation energy of 495.21 kJ/mol.</p>
        <p>The reaction process indole→indole-c at site C8 is energetically similar to reaction-b from indole to indole-b, with an activation energy of 497.77 kJ/mol. From the above calculated results, it can be concluded that the activation energies of homolysis reactions are generally higher than the activation energies of internal hydrogen transfer reactions.</p>
        <p>Based on the internal hydrogen transfer reaction reaction-1, reaction-2, reaction-3 and reaction-4, four possible pathways (path-1, path-2, path-3, path-4) might occur and can be classified into two categories according to their products (NH3 or HCN). NH3 is produced through path-1 and path-3, as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 5, respectively, while in Figures 4 and6, path-2 and path-4 generate HCN.</p>
        <p>For path-1 in Figure 3, indole is converted to the diradical intermediate in-1-1m, via an internal hydrogen transfer transition state in-1-1t (the hydrogen transfers from C7 to C8), with an activation energy of 260.9 kJ/mol. Then the intermediate in-1-1m undergoes a synergy ring-opening transition state in-1-2t to form intermediate in-1-2m. This reaction requires an activation energy of 429.36 kJ/mol. Afterwards, intermediate in-1-2m decomposes into radicals in-1-3m and CN by homolysis of the C-C bond, with a high activation energy of 484.71 kJ/mol. In fact, coal pyrolysis has been confirmed to involve radical reactions [25]. During the pyrolysis process, with the gradual heating, the internal network structure of the coal begins to undergo bond cleavage reactions at 350-400 °C , and the homolytic breaking of covalent bonds in the network structure can generate reactive free radicals(H radicals &amp; CH3 radicals, etc.). Moreover, the cracking of alkanes and aromatics in long chain reactions occurs by C-C and C-H bond homolysis, and C-H bond homolysis competitively forms H radicals [26][27][28]. The free radical CN easily combines with hydrogen radicals to form HCN. The relative energy of the final products in-1-3m and HCN is -48.79 kJ/mol. In path-1, the homolysis reaction in which the products are radicals of in-1-3m and CN is the determining step with an overall activation energy of 484.71 kJ/mol. For both path-2 and path-4, where the final products are NH3, their rate-determining steps are the C1-N bond homolytic cleavage reaction of 2-ethynylaniline which generates free radicals NH2, so their overall activation energy is the same as 598.23 kJ/mol.</p>
        <p>Comparing the activation energies of each path, we can conclude that HCN is generally more likely to form than NH3 when the first step of indole pyrolysis is hydrogen transfer.</p>
        <p>According to the possibility of that the homolysis reaction is the first step in indole pyrolysis, we choosed three more active reaction sites (reaction-a, reaction-b and reactionc in Fig. 2). Based on these three active sites, we designed three reaction paths, path-a, pathb and path-c. Subsequently, the details of the discussion are presented separately.</p>
        <p>In the first pathway (path-a), as shown in Figure 7, indole undergoes a homolysis reaction, that the hydrogen radical is split from the nitrogen atom on indole to generate a radical intermediate in-a with an activation energy of 372.95 kJ/mol. The intermediate ina following transfers a hydrogen atom from C7 to C8 in the form of transition state in-a-1t, which needs an activation energy of 643.45 kJ/mol. After the hydrogen transfer reaction, two unpaired electrons are formed on the C7 atom, and one of the unpaired electrons bonded with the unpaired electron on the nitrogen atom immediately to form the intermediate in-a-1m. Afterwards, the intermediate in-a-1m undergoes a C7-C8 bond homolysis transition state in-a-2t to form a triradical intermedia in-a-2m, and the reaction activation energy is 577.26 kJ/mol. Finally, the intermediate in-a-2m decomposes into products in-a-3m diradical and CN radical through a homolysis reaction with a significantly large activation energy of 947.83 kJ/mol. The radical CN easily combines with the hydrogen radical in the system to form HCN. Therefore, for path-a it is difficult to occur due to the relatively high energy of rate-determining step (947.83 kJ/mol). As a result, the rate-determining step in path-c is the reaction in which the hydrogen atom is transferred from C7 to C8 with an overall activation energy of 981. 89 kJ/mol. In summary, the initial reaction type of indole pyrolysis has significant influences on the formation of HCN or NH3 as shown in Table 1. Two possible pathways (path-2, path-4) can generate the nitrogen-product NH3 and five possible pathways (path-1, path-3, patha, path-b and path-c) can generate the nitrogen-product HCN. In the case of by internal hydrogen transfer as the initial reaction, indole pyrolysis can generates NH3 and HCN. The path-1 is the optimal reaction pathway with an activation energy of 484.71 kJ/mol, and the nitrogen-containing product is HCN. When the bond homolytic cleavage reaction on the indole is used to initiate the subsequent pyrolysis reaction, the nitrogenous product generated by indole pyrolysis can only be HCN, and the activation energies of the different pathways generally this condition are generally higher than the activation energies of the former case. By comparing the calculated results, it is easier to initiate the subsequent reaction by internal hydrogen transfer, which is the dominant initial reaction mechanism for the formation of HCN and NH3 by indole pyrolysis. According to above calculation results, two conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, it is difficult to form HCN and NH3 during the pyrolysis of indole, which is consistent with previous experimental studies. For instance, Jiang et al. [7] asserted that indole was mostly present in tar and coke in coal pyrolysis. Moreover, the structure was stable and it is more difficult to release nitrogen [29]. In fact, Wornat et al. [30] stated that N-heteroaromatic compounds were more thermally stable. Furthermore, Ledesma et al. [31] found that cyano aromatics in tar were stable N-containing structures at 1000 °C. Secondly, it is easier to generate HCN by indole pyrolysis than NH3. This was agreed with experimental findings [32][33][34] such as Madeleine et al. [33] have compared H 12 CN and H 13 CN loss in two specifically labelled indoles, providing evidence for HCN elimination from indole. Additionally, Ren et al. [34] believed that the cracking indole contributes to the higher HCN formation.</p>
        <p>In this study, the formation mechanisms of HCN and NH3 during indole pyrolysis are investigated by DFT calculation based on previous investigations on the experimental study of the nitrogen released from coal, and the research of the mechanism of the indole ring opening reaction. The specific conclusions are as follows:</p>
        <p>1. The initial reaction mode of indole has a great impact on the subsequent pyrolysis pathways. The activation energy of indole pyrolysis with internal hydrogen transfer as the initial mode is generally lower than the hydrogen homolysis from indole.</p>
        <p>2. Indole pyrolysis can produce two main nitrogen-containing products, HCN and NH3.</p>
        <p>HCN is more likely to be generated than NH3 by comparing all of calculated indole pyrolysis mechanisms.</p>
        <p>3. In our calculations, the optimal reaction pathway for generating HCN is path-1. In this pathway, indole is converted to the diradical intermediate via a hydrogen transfers from C7 to C8, and then undergoes a synergy ring-opening reaction, finally, decomposes to get radical CN by homolysis of the C-C bond, with a high rate determing step activation energy of 484.71 kJ/mol.</p>
        <p>4. For the path-2 and path-4 during which NH3 is finally generated, their rate determining steps are the same, that is, the C1-N bond of 2-ethynylaniline is homolytic cleaved to produce free radical NH2, so their overall activation energy is 598.23. kJ / mol.</p>
        <p>a The units for relative energies are kJ/mol.</p>
