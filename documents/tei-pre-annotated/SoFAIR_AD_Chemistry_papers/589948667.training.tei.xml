        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Plant Protection Products (PPPs), also called pesticides, chemical compounds used to fight parasites, including insects, rodents, fungi and unwanted plants (weeds). These products are used in public health to kill disease vectors, such as mosquitoes and, in agriculture, to destroy pests that damage crops. By their nature, these compounds are potentially toxic to other organisms, including humans, and must be used safely and disposed of properly [1].The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Plant Protection Products (PPPs), also called pesticides, chemical compounds used to fight parasites, including insects, rodents, fungi and unwanted plants (weeds).

        <p>Many pesticides released into the environment have been defined by the WHO, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the European Community (EC) as toxic, persistent, bioaccumulative, negatively impacting the soils' physical and chemical properties, extremely harmful to the whole ecosystem's health, man and any other living organism.Many pesticides released into the environment have been defined by the WHO, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the European Community (EC) as toxic, persistent, bioaccumulative, negatively impacting the soils' physical and chemical properties, extremely harmful to the whole ecosystem's health, man and any other living organism.</p>
        <p>These compounds are incredibly harmful not only for human health but also for many living organisms. They cause profound imbalances in the ecosystem due to their particular biochemical characteristics, such as high environmental persistence with direct damage to aquatic ecosystems (fish, amphibians, etc.) and bioaccumulation in animal tissues. Furthermore, the onset of resistances determines the need to synthesize increasingly powerful products, and their broad-spectrum toxicity is capable of destroying many species of pollinating insects (bumblebees, butterflies, bees) without distinction whose disappearance would involve problems of unprecedented gravity [2].These compounds are incredibly harmful not only for human health but also for many living organisms.

        <p>The progenitor of these substances is the famous Orange agent, a herbicide used extensively during the Vietnam War to spraying defoliating agents. This pesticide, composed of a 1: 1 mixture of the herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and acid-2,4,5trichlorophenoxyacetic, was then suspended for its toxic products (formation of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin (TCDD) characteristic of the degradation process, and its effects are still present on populations, war veterans and their descendants more than 40 years after its spread [3].The progenitor of these substances is the famous Orange agent, a herbicide used extensively during the Vietnam War to spraying defoliating agents.

        <p>Due to many pesticides under investigation, users who first approach the quantification of PPPs in water matrices must first decide which method to choose (GC or LC coupled to Mass Spectrometry) and if the method can achieve the desired detection limit and quantification. In light of this, an overview of official methods developed by the Environmental Protection Agency and the analytical feasibility, including the type of water matrix considered and extraction technique for a subset of selected pesticides, is shown in Table S2. Moreover, a collection of the most relevant studies concerning the analysis of pesticides in water bodies with details about the different configurations used based on GC and LC systems, LOQ reached, and further analytical details are provided for each study in Table S3 and S4.Due to many pesticides under investigation, users who first approach the quantification of PPPs in water matrices must first decide which method to choose (GC or LC coupled to Mass Spectrometry) and if the method can achieve the desired detection limit and quantification.

        <p>The environmental legislation on water resources protection at the EU level [4,5], known as Water Framework Directive (WFD), takes into serious consideration the PPPs enhancing that continuous monitoring is necessary due to their dangerousness and massive use. The principles of the Directive [6] identify a common framework for Community action for the sustainable use of pesticides through the identification, by each Member State, of a National Action Plans (NAP) to define specific measures to reduce their impacts and risk, for humans and the environment, associated with their use. On the one hand, regulations require the monitoring of surface and groundwater bodies always to keep their state under control and, on the other hand, try to impose a sustainable use of pesticides.The environmental legislation on water resources protection at the EU level [4,5], known as Water Framework Directive (WFD), takes into serious consideration the PPPs enhancing that continuous monitoring is necessary due to their dangerousness and massive use.

        <p>The Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) has compiled the ranking of the European Union countries where the most pesticides are sold among the 20 Member States for which complete data are available: first Spain, followed by France, Italy and Germany. The percentage of sales in these four countries is 79% of the total.

        <p>In Spain, the monitoring of PPPs conforms to the NAP and the Royal Decree 1311/2012, establishes a policy to ensure sustainable use of pesticides, including the Directive into the Spanish national law. The NAP aims to reduce the Plant Protection Products risks and effects on human health and the environment, promote the integrated management of pests and alternatives to PPPs. The NAP took in force from January January 11, 2018 to December 3131 December 2022, considering to be extended if necessary [7].In Spain, the monitoring of PPPs conforms to the NAP and the Royal Decree 1311/2012, establishes a policy to ensure sustainable use of pesticides, including the Directive into the Spanish national law.

        <p>In Europe, France is the greatest user of PPPs in ton per year. To support the sustainable use of pesticides in agriculture, France put in place an ambitious policy in response to the EU Directive 2009/ 128 to identify National Action Plans [8]. The "Ecophyto 2018 Plan", introduced in 2008, aimed to reduce the use of Plant Protection Products by 50% within ten years. To reach this goal, several actions were introduced: a national pest monitoring system, a network of farms and field experiments (DEPHY), a training and certification scheme for farmers (Certiphyto), etc. Following an evaluation in the 5-year term and its further revision, the Plan has implemented (Ecophyto II) in 2016. Within Ecophyto, a specific axis is devoted to Research and Innovation to orientate, promote and disseminate relevant scientific and technological advances in support of Plan [9]. In Germany, the Working Group on Water Issues of the Federal States and the Federal Government instituted monitoring programs of surface waters called "Rahmenkonzeption Monitoring" (RAKON) [10]. An ordinance for the Protection of Surface Waters [11], updated in 2016, implemented this program and set up Environmental Quality Standards (EQSs) for certain substances and better defined the monitoring programs. The monitoring results were submitted to the EU Commission.In Europe, France is the greatest user of PPPs in ton per year.

        <p>At a European level, the WFD provides that the Member States adopt specific measures to combat water pollution. Due to its importance, one of the fundamental regulations is the European one on drinking water [12] which sets a maximum concentration of 0.1 mg/L for each pesticide and 0.5 mg/L for the total amount of pesticides present in the sample. In Europe, monitoring the quality of drinking water concerning pesticides and their metabolites is a rather complicated task, as around 500 pesticides are sold on the European market.At a European level, the WFD provides that the Member States adopt specific measures to combat water pollution.

        <p>Regard the chemical state, the substances are divided between those belonging to the list of priority and those that do not belong [90]. The former are further classified into priority substances (P), priority hazardous substances (PP) and remaining (E). For each of the pesticides belonging to the priority list, threshold values for groundwater and quality standards are defined as environmental quality standard-annual average (EQS-MA) and environmental quality standard-maximum concentration admissible (EQS-CMA), expressed in mg/L for surface waters. For substances not belonging to the priority list, only an EQS-MA value is defined, while for pesticides (and related metabolites) not present in this last table, a standard precautionary value equal to 0.1 mg/L for each compound is considered [19].Regard the chemical state, the substances are divided between those belonging to the list of priority and those that do not belong [90].

        <p>Italy adopted its NAP [7], paying the utmost attention to the criteria for creating monitoring networks to identify better the problem of pesticide residues in Italian water bodies. Specific measures to protect the aquatic environment and reduce the use of pesticides in specific areas such as railway, road network areas used by the general public and protected nature areas were inserted. In addition to replacement or limitation of use or elimination of some pesticides, these mitigation measures leave the choice to the Regions and Autonomous Provinces to be more accurate in the environmental protection. These actions take into account the characteristics of the territory and its fragility, the type of pressures present, the expected type of response and the type of ecosystems.Italy adopted its NAP [7], paying the utmost attention to the criteria for creating monitoring networks to identify better the problem of pesticide residues in Italian water bodies.

        <p>In Italy, it was published online on December 23, 2020, the National Report on Pesticides in Waters carried out in compliance with the tasks established by the NAP [22]. The report's purpose was to illustrate the state of contamination of surface and groundwater resources resulting from pesticides, both in terms of territorial diffusion and temporal evolution. Indirectly, therefore, allowed us to verify the effectiveness of the measures to protect the aquatic environment provided in the phase of authorisation and use of these substances.In Italy, it was published online on December 23, 2020, the National Report on Pesticides in Waters carried out in compliance with the tasks established by the NAP [22].

        <p>In Italy, about 114,000 tons of PPPs per year are used in agriculture [23], including about 400 different substances. There is no similar information on quantities for biocides, and there is no adequate knowledge of the use scenarios and their geographical distribution. Hence the difficulty of planning monitoring that covers a large part of the national territory, controls many substances and requires continuous updating made necessary by the use of new substances.In Italy, about 114,000 tons of PPPs per year are used in agriculture [23], including about 400 different substances.

        <p>The identification of the selected priority compound to be searched for each station based on indices and pressure indicators included substances listed by the legislation, substances mainly used in the territory (obtained from sales data and authorisations on crops), substances found during previous monitoring and substances with water environmental affinity and characterised by high environmental risk. Following these criteria, a list of 174 priority pesticides, including 67% of herbicides and plant growth regulators, 55% of fungicides, 39% of insecticides and 13% of acaricides has been drawn up.The identification of the selected priority compound to be searched for each station based on indices and pressure indicators included substances listed by the legislation, substances mainly used in the territory (obtained from sales data and authorisations on crops), substances found during previous monitoring and substances with water environmental affinity and characterised by high environmental risk.

        <p>The presence of pesticides in the environment and water bodies is associated with the massive use of insecticides-fungicidesherbicides in agriculture: a phenomenon with possible adverse effects on the environment and ecosystems. The danger of pesticides also affects humans by the transfer of harmful substances to food and water. For this reason, Italian and European regulations set concentration limits, assessed through the monitoring of environmental matrices. The water sample collection and conservation represent crucial steps in monitoring Plans with integrated chemical analysis. Fundamental principles for the sampling strategies of surface waters and groundwaters have been reported in the guidance document No.7 Monitoring under the Water Framework Directive [25]. As a general rule, the sampling strategy adopted depends mainly on the goals of the monitoring, the physicochemical properties of analytes to investigate and the characteristics of the water body.The presence of pesticides in the environment and water bodies is associated with the massive use of insecticides-fungicidesherbicides in agriculture: a phenomenon with possible adverse effects on the environment and ecosystems.

        <p>Refers to these 160 compounds, the collection of water samples for pesticides analyses implies utilising mainly amber glass containers, particularly for about 70% of herbicide and fungicide and 87% of insecticide (Fig. 2). The transport of samples under refrigerated conditions is essential for monitoring pesticides in water matrices. The storage time of water samples should not exceed 48 h to determine most fungicides and insecticides; conversely, for 45% of the herbicides considered in Table S1, no immediate analysis is required.

        <p>Notwithstanding the considerable progress made by the instrumentation both in terms of sensitivity and selectivity, the recent European regulations [29,30] have imposed very restrictive legal limits, which still makes it necessary in many cases to support preparation techniques and pre-concentration of the sample.Notwithstanding the considerable progress made by the instrumentation both in terms of sensitivity and selectivity, the recent European regulations [29,30] have imposed very restrictive legal limits, which still makes it necessary in many cases to support preparation techniques and pre-concentration of the sample.</p>

        <p>In addition, although the LLE extraction technique is still very much used, it occurs to consider that its application can lead to the risk of analyte losses during the sample transfer and solvent evaporation phases. Often this technique provides a large amount of final extract, requiring a significant volume reduction through solvent evaporation to concentrate the analytes of interest. Solvent evaporation is a crucial step of the technique, and a lot of operator skill is required due to the risk of losing the most volatile analytes from the sample (e.g. Dichlorvos, Ethoprophos, methamidophos, mevinphos [47]). Furthermore, during extraction, both the sample and the organic solvent keep in contact with the container and laboratory equipment surfaces for a considerable time, bringing a risk of adsorption to these surfaces with the consequently lower recovery of the compounds.In addition, although the LLE extraction technique is still very much used, it occurs to consider that its application can lead to the risk of analyte losses during the sample transfer and solvent evaporation phases.

        <p>This resulted in implementing the traditional LC-MS techniques by Fast Chromatography and Ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC). The last one allows achieving high backpressures (up to 1500 bar) with reduced column diameter (from 4.6 mm to 2.1 mm), reaching the sufficient eluent flow rate in the column at high linear velocities with a greater separation efficiency [148].This resulted in implementing the traditional LC-MS techniques by Fast Chromatography and Ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC).

        <p>The physicochemical properties control the environmental fate of pesticides, particularly their solubility in water defined by the octanol-water partition coefficient and their mobility and persistence in the soil. Once in the soil, depending on the molecular characteristics of the substances, the conditions of use and the type of territory, these compounds can undergo various processes, including vaporization in the atmosphere, adsorption on organic matter, leaching into groundwater or the washout in surface waters causing their discovery in the various environmental compartments (air, soil, water, sediments) (Fig. 3).The physicochemical properties control the environmental fate of pesticides, particularly their solubility in water defined by the octanol-water partition coefficient and their mobility and persistence in the soil.

        <p>Furthermore, the contamination of water bodies by pesticides, in addition to their intrinsic properties, depends on various factors such as the type of cultivation/treatment, the speed and frequency of application, the seasonality, influence of trophic status, the amount of the products, the type of soil (texture and organic matter content), the hydrogeological characteristics of the territory and climatic conditions (temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation) [150,151].Furthermore, the contamination of water bodies by pesticides, in addition to their intrinsic properties, depends on various factors such as the type of cultivation/treatment, the speed and frequency of application, the seasonality, influence of trophic status, the amount of the products, the type of soil (texture and organic matter content), the hydrogeological characteristics of the territory and climatic conditions (temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation) [150,151].</p>
        <p>Depending on the chemical stability, these substances can undergo degradation processes; therefore, not only the active principles but also their possible metabolites can pollute the waters [152]. An example is represented by aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), which derives from the rapid degradation of Glyphosate. The AMPA molecule is more soluble and mobile: if the Glyphosate can be transported up to 25e36 cm deep, the AMPA can reach up to 50 cm deep.Depending on the chemical stability, these substances can undergo degradation processes; therefore, not only the active principles but also their possible metabolites can pollute the waters [152].

        <p>This review study enhances the need to conduct continuous environmental studies for the monitoring of pesticides, given the wide variety of molecules present in this category and their use, the probable underestimation of their risk due to the not consideration of possible effects of the mixtures present in the environment (the so-called "cocktail effect") and the difficulty of identifying the more volatile and labile substances recently formulated and sold on the market which are less persistent in the environment and require immediate analyses after sampling.This review study enhances the need to conduct continuous environmental studies for the monitoring of pesticides, given the wide variety of molecules present in this category and their use, the probable underestimation of their risk due to the not consideration of possible effects of the mixtures present in the environment (the so-called "cocktail effect") and the difficulty of identifying the more volatile and labile substances recently formulated and sold on the market which are less persistent in the environment and require immediate analyses after sampling.</p>
        <p>The sample pre-concentration and extraction methodologies have advantages and limitations, but all require good operator preparation and almost always special tools involving a large combination of analytical techniques applied in multiple configurations. Increasingly necessary to develop multiresidual methods, reliable, safe for the operator, which request small organic solvent and sufficiently sensitive to reach the standards set by the specific regulations. However, PPPs with more specific chemical structures, such as glyphosate, are excluded from the multiresidual approaches, for which a particular and specific methodology is required.The sample pre-concentration and extraction methodologies have advantages and limitations, but all require good operator preparation and almost always special tools involving a large combination of analytical techniques applied in multiple configurations.

        <p>The official methods should be updated considering the recent improvements of modern analytical instruments that offer evergrowing sensitivity, often avoiding pre-concentration and extraction of the sample due to direct injection of larger volume of water sample (Large volume injection).The official methods should be updated considering the recent improvements of modern analytical instruments that offer evergrowing sensitivity, often avoiding pre-concentration and extraction of the sample due to direct injection of larger volume of water sample (Large volume injection).</p>
