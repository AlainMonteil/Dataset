        <p>Phenolic acids are antioxidant compounds, which are widely used in the food and cosmetic industries because of their intriguing physiological functions. However, incorporating an alkyl chain into phenolic acids could modify their hydrophilic-lipophilic balance to generate amphiphiles molecules, called "phenolipids (PLs)". Some phenolipids have shown stronger antibacterial activities against foodborne pathogens compared with the corresponding phenolic acid in that covalent modification of phenolic acids through lipophilization plays a dominant role in their capacities of passively permeating the cell membranes to reach their targets.Phenolic acids are antioxidant compounds, which are widely used in the food and cosmetic industries because of their intriguing physiological functions.

The results show that OG damages the membrane and permeates into cells and then interacts with DNA. OG could further disturb the activity of the respiratory electron transport chain (ETC) to induce a high-level toxic ROS (hydroxyl radicals) generation and up-regulation of the ROS genes. These results illustrated OG has multiple mechanisms of bactericidal action, ultimately leading to cell death.(2) Among them, octyl gallate (OG) exerted excellent inhibitory effect and potential mechanisms OG was fully elucidated.

        <p>Due to the diverse requirements in the marketing of food products, the use of chemical additives in food, such as antioxidant and antimicrobial agents, has still gained a growing level of importance to preserve flavor and enhance its texture or appearance, or for other technological functions. Many studies have shown that microorganisms are the primary factor in the degeneration of food during transportation and storage (Li, Cui, Bai, Zhao, &amp; Li, 2016), which leads to significant losses to the food industry. For instance, most fish species highly degrade as a result of microbial spoilage from surface bacteria. Moreover, diseases caused by foodborne microorganisms in food remain one of the greatest threats to both public health and the food industry, especially, in developing countries like China. It was reported that 140,101 foodborne diseases and 1,427 deaths had been recorded from 2001 to 2010 in China (Luo, Li, Liu, &amp; Tan, 2017). As a global foodborne pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can invade the body and cause a wide range of infections, including food poisoning. Food products can induce S. aureus growth and activate staphylococcal enterotoxin which is responsible for gastrointestinal illness. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a common cause of food poisoning which is considered the world's third most significant cause of diseases such as severe gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic colitis, and the life-threatening hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among foodborne pathogens has increased during recent decades. For instance, a significant antibiotic-resistant had been noticed in Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157: H7 (Chirila et al., 2017). This requires new non-antibiotic substances to inhibit bacteria, bringing safety and security to the food industry. Natural products are the best choice, and their excellent antibacterial and antioxidant effects are in line with people's needs.Due to the diverse requirements in the marketing of food products, the use of chemical additives in food, such as antioxidant and antimicrobial agents, has still gained a growing level of importance to preserve flavor and enhance its texture or appearance, or for other technological functions.

        <p>Lately, phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, in particular) have obtained an increasing interest in the food industry stemming from their potential bioactive properties. In addition, plant phenolics and extracts rich in such substances can be excellent inhibitors of many foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria activities. In our continuing search for antimicrobial agents as food preservatives (Shi et al., 2017;2018;2019), incorporating an alkyl chain into a carboxyl group of phenolic acids could modify their hydrophilic-lipophilic balance to generate amphiphiles molecules, called "phenolipids (PLs)". Some phenolipids have shown stronger antibacterial activities against foodborne pathogens compared with the corresponding phenolic acid in that covalent modification of phenolic acids through lipophilization plays a dominant role in their capacity of passively permeating the cell membranes to reach their targets. Recently, a series of alkyl ferulates have been prepared and their biological activities were compared by us. Interestingly, it has been found that as the length of the alkyl chain extends, the antibacterial activity begins to rise, and a point is soon reached beyond which activity disappears (the so-called 'cut-off' phenomenon). Among them, hexyl ferulate (FAC6) was most effective against E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) and S. aureus (Shi et al., 2017;2018;2019). Similarly, butanol ferulate (FAC4) is more active than ferulic acid and ethyl ferulate (FAC2), as well as the other alkyl ferulic esters, to effectively protect the PC12 cells against oxidative stress through reducing ROS formation and inhibiting Aβ 1-42 aggregation (Shi et al., 2020). These results supported the fact that the length of the alkyl group considerably influenced their biological activities to a large extent.Lately, phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, in particular) have obtained an increasing interest in the food industry stemming from their potential bioactive properties.

        <p>It has been reported that the mechanism of action of gallic acid (GA), a hydroxybenzoic acid, is similar as that of ferulic acid, a hydroxycinnamic acid, when assessed on E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and L. monocytogenes (Borges, Ferreira, Saavedra, &amp; Simões, 2013).It has been reported that the mechanism of action of gallic acid (GA), a hydroxybenzoic acid, is similar as that of ferulic acid, a hydroxycinnamic acid, when assessed on E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and L. monocytogenes (Borges, Ferreira, Saavedra, &amp; Simões, 2013).</p>
        <p>Moreover, GA is a widely occurring metabolite in the plant kingdom and well known for its antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antiviral and analgesic properties (Giftson, &amp; Jayanthi, 2008;Kang et al., 2008;Kim et al., 2006). Also, phenolipids based on GA, especially alkyl gallates, exhibited more favorable properties, and in many cases, these effects were even stronger than those observed for GA itself. GA and its alkyl esters, as phenolic antioxidants, are widely found in wine and green tea (Butt, &amp; Sultan, 2009). To date, in addition to their antioxidant activity, alkyl gallates have been reported to exhibit various other biological activities.Moreover, GA is a widely occurring metabolite in the plant kingdom and well known for its antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antiviral and analgesic properties (Giftson, &amp; Jayanthi, 2008;Kang et al., 2008;Kim et al., 2006).

To date, in addition to their antioxidant activity, alkyl gallates have been reported to exhibit various other biological activities.</p>
        <p>For instance, GA-based phenolipids with eight or more carbon atoms in the side-chain were more efficient than GA in antimicrobial (Kubo et al., 2001;2002;2003;2004) and antitumor activity, and the chain lengths of alkyl gallates significantly affected their antibacterial activities. Notably, in comparison to other alkyl gallate esters, octyl gallate (OG), exhibits an outstanding antibacterial effect against Salmonella choleraesius, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Monilia albicans and Aspergillus Niger (Kubo, 2002;2003;2004). Moreover, OG has been approved for use as antioxidant additives in the food and pharmaceutical industries because of significantly low toxicity both in vitro and in vivo (Sivasankaran, Vikraman, Thomas, &amp; Kumar, 2016). However, to the best of our knowledge, the intrinsically antibacterial mechanism of alkyl gallates against foodborne bacteria on the one hand, the role of the hydrophobic portion on the other, has hitherto remained poorly understood and wildly debated. Concurrently, few studies have been conducted on whether alkyl gallates have the potential to be considered as multi-functionalized food preservatives that satisfy quality maintenance and safety drivers for consumers. Hence, their further evaluation was undertaken to gain comprehensive insights into their bactericidal action. More importantly, an agent with the dual function as an antioxidant (generally, in preventing food lipid oxidation) and antimicrobial (preventing the growth of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria) would provide us more promising options in the food industry with minimizing the total amount of additives used in foods. Furthermore, electrospun nanofibers incorporated with antimicrobial agents can not only drive the durable release of bioactive agents from nanofibers to the food surface but also amplify notable synergistic antibacterial effects on a wide range of microorganisms (Lou, Osemwegie, &amp; Ramkumar, 2012). As such, it would be more meaningful for the incorporation of electrospun nanofibers with the efficient antibacterial agents.For instance, GA-based phenolipids with eight or more carbon atoms in the side-chain were more efficient than GA in antimicrobial (Kubo et al., 2001;2002;2003;2004) and antitumor activity, and the chain lengths of alkyl gallates significantly affected their antibacterial activities.

        <p>The antibacterial experiments reveal that OG exhibits extensive bacteriostatic and bactericidal ability against both strains. Moreover, in addition to the role of the hydrophobic alkyl moiety of gallates, the antibacterial mechanism of OG against tested bacterial species has been predominantly characterized through a series of methods including the evaluation of cellular membrane permeability and integrity, the alterations in the membrane fatty acids composition and bacterial morphology, intracellular damage caused by the participation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as the interaction between OG and DNA. Considering the growing interest in the application of electrospun nanofibers in the food industry, the ultra-efficient and safe antibacterial system was constructed using OG encapsulated with nanofibers by electrospinning and its synergetic sterilization effect was also ascertained on the microbial load of Chinese Taihu icefish (Neosalanx taihuensis Chen). This study is expected to provide a comprehensive view of the antimicrobial mechanism of OG on E. coli and S. aureus, and a novel case of food packaging applications via electrospinning technique combined with OG for food preservations.The antibacterial experiments reveal that OG exhibits extensive bacteriostatic and bactericidal ability against both strains.

        <p>A series of alkyl esters were synthesized through the enzyme-mediated reactions (Shi et al., 2018) and their MIC and MBC values against E. coli and S. aureus are shown in Table 1. Notably, it appears that their inhibitory activities were correlated with the length of alkyl chains. More specifically, MIC or MBC values first declined and then raised with the extension in the length of the alkyl chain (Fig. 1A), which is known as the "cut-off effect". Moreover, gallate esters with longer alkyl chain length exhibited a noticeable increase in the antibacterial activity, with 8-carbon gallate against G-E. coli and 8-, 10-, 12-carbon gallate against G+ S. aureus resulting in the largest increases in bactericidal activity. Also, lipophilicity, as an important parameter to expect the biological activity of alkyl gallates, was also evaluated using the theoretical partition coefficients (clog P) (Fig. S3). Since GA did show a relatively high MBC value against E. coli up to 6.4 mM, the alkyl group must be mainly attributed to eliciting the antibacterial activity. In this case, the growth of G-E. coli and G+ S. aureus were effectively inhibited by octyl gallate (OG), at very low concentrations, presenting a MIC of 0.1 mM and MBC of 0.1 mM for E. coli and a MIC of 0.05 mM and MBC of 0.1 mM for S. aureus, respectively. Furthermore, the discrimination in values of MIC and MBC of OG against both bacteria was not more than 2-fold, suggesting that its activity is bactericidal. These data suggest that the antibacterial efficiency of alkyl gallates is close to the extended length of the alkyl chain. Similar findings were reported by Kubo et al. (2002;2004) for alkyl gallates against G-Salmonella choleraesuis and G+ Bacillus subtilis. A parabolic relationship, in fact, was found between the antibacterial activities of alkyl gallates and their lipophilicity and the antibacterial activity was maximized at the alkyl chain length of C8 and C11 against B. subtilis, while octyl(C8) gallate was the most effective against S. choleraesuis. Our recent findings also showed that the antibacterial properties of alkyl ferulates against both E. coli and L. monocytogenes were noted to be a parabolic function of the alkyl chain lengths and hexyl(C6) ferulate is found to have the optimum alkyl chain length that maximizes the antibacterial performance (Shi et al., 2018;2019). In addition, S. aureus was more susceptible to alkyl gallates than the G+ E. coli. The MIC and MBC values of OG against S. aureus are lower than those against E. coli, which is consistent with the results by Kubo et al. (2002;2004). The envelope of G-and G+ bacteria greatly differ in their individual architecture, with that of the G-bacteria being the most complex one since it is composed of two distinct lipid membranes: an outer membrane (OM) and an inner membrane (IM) separated by a thin layer of peptidoglycan.A series of alkyl esters were synthesized through the enzyme-mediated reactions (Shi et al., 2018) and their MIC and MBC values against E. coli and S. aureus are shown in Table 1.

        <p>The length of the alkyl chain of these gallates is found to be associated with their biological actions (Kubo, Fujita, Nihei, &amp; Nihei, 2004), such as antibacterial activity, but the precise role is still largely unknown. The cellular uptake of them in bacterial cells might provide a substantial basis for their antibacterial effects occurring in vivo. It is found that OG showed significantly the highest bio-uptake efficiency in E. coli and S. aureus samples for 30 and 60 mins compared to other gallates (Fig. S4). Moreover, the maximum uptaking rates (µ max ) of OG in E. coli and S. aureus was 58.0 min -1 and 67.6 min -1 , respectively, which was relatively higher than that of other gallates and GA (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, most of the tetradecyl(C14) gallate (TeG) was not uptaken into cells and remained in the water-based medium, probably in the form of an insoluble monolayer or spread film (Kubo, Xiao, Nihei, Fujita, Yamagiwa, &amp; Kamikawa, 2002). Also, the uptake results of OG and TeG were consistent with the antibacterial results in Table 1. It is noteworthy that, however, although the antimicrobial activity of hexyl(C6) gallate (HG) was significantly higher than that of GA, bacteria treated with HG did not show a higher bio-uptake compared to GA, indicating that the inactivation toward the bacteria by HG followed a different mechanism than GA and the extent of bio-uptake may not be the only factor that affects their antibacterial effects. These data suggest that OG has a relatively higher affinity to the cell membrane than GA and other alkyl gallates. The mechanism of inactivation for OG is distinct from the corresponding GA, which is consistent with our previous findings related to t alkyl ferulates (Shi et al., 2018;2019).The length of the alkyl chain of these gallates is found to be associated with their biological actions (Kubo, Fujita, Nihei, &amp; Nihei, 2004), such as antibacterial activity, but the precise role is still largely unknown.

        <p>On the basis of the data obtained, the alkyl chain length greatly influences the antibacterial activities and the gallate with the optimized alkyl chain is able to enter into the membrane lipid bilayer portion to disorder the fluid bilayer of the membrane and even invade the cells. On the other hand, apart from the length of the alkyl chain, the data obtained so far suggest that biochemical mechanisms could play a more essential role in the antibacterial activity of alkyl gallates. Taken together, OG displayed drastically increased bacterial uptake, rendering outstanding antimicrobial effectiveness. Besides, it is currently permitted as an antioxidant additive in food (Sivasankaran, Vikraman, Thomas, &amp; Kumar, 2016). Therefore, these results prompted us to further investigate, in more detail, the potential antibacterial mechanism of OG as a promising antimicrobial.On the basis of the data obtained, the alkyl chain length greatly influences the antibacterial activities and the gallate with the optimized alkyl chain is able to enter into the membrane lipid bilayer portion to disorder the fluid bilayer of the membrane and even invade the cells.

        <p>Inhibitory activities of OG against E. coli and S. aureus were found to be dose-and time-dependent (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, compared to G-E. coli, a significant decline of OD 600 nm of G+ S. aureus with the exposure to OG at 1×MBC was maintained for 12 h, indicating the partial cell wall lysis occurring induced by OG (Fig. 1C-b). However, this phenomenon can not be seen in Fig. 1C-a for E. coli. The difference in lysis between E. coli and S. aureus may be due to the fact that G+ S. aureus does not have an outer membrane preventing foreign molecule influx (Shi et al., 2019). The antibacterial effect of OG was also evaluated by time-kill kinetics profiles against both bacterial strains (Fig. 1D). OG treatment at the concentration higher than 0.1 mM generated a bactericidal effect that reduced cell population to the limit of detection, demonstrating that E. coli and S. aureus can be effectively exterminated by OG. Cells grown with OG showed a more severe phenotype and decrease in size (Fig. 1E). On average, cell length decreased from 2.0 µm to 0.6 µm for E. coli, from 0.8 µm to 0.5 µm for S. aureus, respectively. PI can only enter into bacterial cells with damaged membranes and bind to nucleic acids, increasing the fluorescence signals (Park &amp; Kang, 2013). Therefore, PI uptake was used to characterize the permeability of the (inner) membranes of E. coli and S. aureus. In Fig. 2A, the fluorescence intensity of PI significantly increased in an OG concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, for E. coli cells treated with OG at 1×MBC, PI uptake values maintain constant as the treatment time was extended (Fig. 2A-a), whereas it significantly increased as the incubation time increased in S. aureus exposed to 1×MBC OG (Fig. 2A-b). This may due to the lysis in S. aureus caused by OG with relatively high concentrations, leading to more PI entering cytoplasm and binding to DNA. This further corroborates the observed changes in Fig. 1C. Additionally, the values of samples from both bacterial strains exposed to OG at 1×MBC sharply increased at 0.5 h. This result is consistent with the data in Fig. 1D related to a rapid bactericidal property of OG at 1×MBC, clearly suggesting that the antibacterial mechanism of OG was related to the cell membrane (Shi et al., 2018).Inhibitory activities of OG against E. coli and S. aureus were found to be dose-and time-dependent (Fig. 1C).

        <p>Correspondingly, the leakage of proteins shows a similar pattern as the results in the release of nucleotides (Fig. S5). We also measured the electrical conductivity of the bacterial suspensions and found that samples in the treatment group exhibited higher conductivity (P˂0.05) (Fig. S6). These findings showed that OG could compromise the integrity of the membrane and lead to the noticeable leakage of cytoplasmic contents from bacterial cytoplasm (Shi et al., 2018;Shen et al., 2015). The difference in structural integrity between the control and treatment groups can be clearly observed by using SEM analysis in Fig. 2C. Normal E. coli cells were rod-shaped with the smooth surface (Fig. 2C-a), whereas the cell membrane of bacteria treated with OG was obviously ruined with rough surfaces and tremendous membrane fragments (Fig. 2C-b). Moreover, the size of OG-treated E. coli cells (˂2.0 µm) became smaller compared with the control (~2.5 µm), indicating that OG inhibits the growth of E. coli. Similarly, the cell deformation and morphological alternations could be easily observed in S. aureus with the OG treatment (Fig. 2C-c,d). After 2 h, cell adhesion and boundaries were unclear and the cell membranes were fractured.

Based on the GC-MS data, PCA analysis was utilized to discern which MFAs were responsible for the difference between the control and samples exposed to OG. As shown in Fig. S7, except for the control and ethanol groups, different groups formed distinct clusters, inferring that the exposure of E. coli and S. aureus to OG may cause significant discriminations in the MFAs composition for both bacterial strains. In Fig. 2D and Table S2, all 13 identified MFAs of G-E.coli were divided into three categories, saturated fatty acids (SFAs), unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) and cyclopropane fatty acids (CFAs). A significant increase in UFAs (from 21.82% to 57.71%), coupled with a decrease of SFAs (from 78.18% to 42.29%) and CFAs (from 9.73% to 4.87%), can be observed as E. coli cells were incubated with OG (from 0 to 0.05 mM) (Fig. 2D-a2). The increase in UFAs composition was mainly attributed to the increased proportions of C18:2 and C18:1. On the other hand, the decrease in CFAs and SFAs was mainly due to the declined proportions of C17:0cyclo and C19:0cyclo, C16:0 and C18:0, respectively. As shown in Fig. S8, the ratios of SFAs to UFAs decreased with increasing concentrations of OG, which is consistent with some previous reports showing that the proportion of UFAs and membrane fluidity of E. coli would increase when they were exposed to naringenin (Wang et al., 2018). In addition, we also found that the proportion of CFAs also reduced with the treatment of OG. According to the previous report (Poger, &amp; Mark, 2015), CFAs may not only stabilize membranes against adverse environmental disturbances but also promote the cell membrane fluidity.A total of 13 membrane fatty acids (MFAs) in E. coli and a total of 14 MFAs in S. aureus were identified using GC-MS.

        <p>Correspondingly, a total of 14 MFAs of G+ bacteria, S. aureus, can be divided into unbranched (UBFAs) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), wherein BCFAs include both iso-and anteiso-BCFAs (Fig. 2D and Table S3). In Fig. 2D-b2 and S8, the relative proportion of UBFAs of S. aureus incubated with OG at 1/3×MIC was increased to 70.52%, while iso-and anteiso-BCFAs were reduced to 9.91% and 19.57%, respectively. The ratios of UBFAs to BCFAs were elevated with an increase in OG concentrations, which was is inconsistent with some previous studies demonstrating the increase in the proportion of BCFAs for some G+ bacteria exposed to the antimicrobial stress (Wang et al., 2018;Sun et al.,2012). However, such alterations in MFAs were in accordance with the other previous study showing that S. aureus responds to undesired conditions, such as carvacrol and thymol or higher growth temperatures, by lowering the biosynthesis of iso and anteisoC15:0 and increasing the levels of C16:0 and C18:0 (Di Pasqua, Hoskins, Betts, &amp; Mauriello, 2006).Correspondingly, a total of 14 MFAs of G+ bacteria, S. aureus, can be divided into unbranched (UBFAs) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), wherein BCFAs include both iso-and anteiso-BCFAs (Fig. 2D and Table S3).

        <p>Taken together, our data suggest that alterations in bacterial MFAs composition have the potential to compromise cell wall structure and integrity, which render them sensitive to more than one antimicrobial mechanism, resulting in a marked loss of bacterial survival.Taken together, our data suggest that alterations in bacterial MFAs composition have the potential to compromise cell wall structure and integrity, which render them sensitive to more than one antimicrobial mechanism, resulting in a marked loss of bacterial survival.</p>
        <p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly reactive chemical species. The main types of ROS include free radicals, like superoxide anion radicals (•O 2 -), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH). They are known to play a physiological role in antimicrobial effect by reacting with biologically essential molecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, eventually resulting in the oxidative damage or even the death of organisms (Catala, 2012). Xiong et al. (2017) reported that the antibacterial activity of EGCG towards E. coli was related to oxidative stress due to ROS generation, especially interior •OH radicals.

        <p>Thus, the overall ROS generation was determined using an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe, DCFH-DA. Fig. 3A shows that the ROS formation in bacterial cells was remarkably increased with the concentration of OG. To further confirm which kind of ROS was mainly involved in OG-mediated killing, the bacterial cells were incubated in the presence of commonly used antioxidants (NAC and TEMPOL) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) scavengers (DMSO and thiourea).Thus, the overall ROS generation was determined using an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe, DCFH-DA.

        <p>In Fig. 3B and 3C, exogenous TEMPOL did not reduce the antibacterial activity of OG, whereas NAC significantly reduced the inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the presence of either DMSO or thiourea significantly erased the inhibitory activity of OG. Thiourea as an effective •OH radicals scavenger is known to mitigate the effects of •OH radicals in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Touati et al., 1995). These results suggest that OG-induced intracellular •OH radicals might play a vital role in OG-induced bacterial inhibition. Additionally, we incubated OG-exposed E. coli with the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl, which is an established means of blocking Fenton reaction-mediated •OH radicals formation by sequestering unbound iron (Imlay, Chin &amp; Linn, 1988). For the effect of 2,2'-dipyridyl and thiourea on the viability of bacteria grown in the presence of OG as compared to the samples treated only with OG, a significant increase in bacterial survival following the addition of 2,2'-dipyridyl and thiourea was observed (Fig. 3D), clearly confirming that •OH radicals are involved in OG-induced cell death. These changes of •OH radicals levels can be displayed in a more visible way using the flow cytometry with the dye hydroxyphenyl fluorescein (HPF), which can be oxidized by •OH radicals with high specificity (Setsukinai, Urano, Kakinuma, Majima, &amp; Nagano, 2003). As depicted in Fig. 3E, the addition of OG led to an increased level of intracellular •OH, whereas NAC, thiourea and 2,2'-dipyridyl noticeably reduced the •OH levels in both bacterial cells exposed to OG, thus preventing both strains from the subsequent adverse impacts of OG (Fig. 3D).In Fig. 3B and 3C, exogenous TEMPOL did not reduce the antibacterial activity of OG, whereas NAC significantly reduced the inhibitory activity.

        <p>Furthermore, ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation, oxidation of proteins, and DNA damage are well-known outcomes of ROS, leading to cellular damage and ultimately to cell death. MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation, was quantitatively measured in E. coli treated with OG to evaluate the potential lipid peroxidation. The contents of MDA increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) by 1.13-fold in the cell-free extracts of E. coli treated with 0.2 mM OG (Fig. S9), suggesting that •OH functioned as an initiator of lipid peroxidation resulting in oxidative damage to the bacteria. Some reports documented that lipid peroxidation of bacteria including E. coli caused by •OH generated via a Fenton-like reaction (Catala, 2012;Hong, Kang, Michels, &amp; Gadura, 2012). Besides, the genome DNA image of agarose gel electrophoresis in Fig. 3F and S9 displayed that the bacterial genome bands were more faint compare to the control, indicating that the damage of genomic integrity by intracellular ROS induced by OG.Furthermore, ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation, oxidation of proteins, and DNA damage are well-known outcomes of ROS, leading to cellular damage and ultimately to cell death.

        <p>Inspired by these above observations in a link between OG's killing and ROS, we presumed that OG should also affect the bacterial respiratory electron transport chain (ETC), which is a common endogenous source of ROS. It is well known that the majority generation of superoxide could be stimulated in bacterial cells through oxidation of the ETC driven by oxygen and the conversion of ETC activity, this should translate into energy production in the form of ATP, which can be regarded as another indicator of ETC status (Lok et al., 2006). As expected, E. coli and S. aureus treated with 1×MIC of OG showed a rapidly enhanced ATP level during 2 h of treatment (Fig. S10).

In Fig. 3H and 3I, the addition of NAC abrogated the OG induced ATP increase and NAC significantly improved E. coli survival after OG exposure. In stark contrast, TEMPOL did not inhibit the OG-induced ATP increase. Accordingly, it conferred no discernible protection against the OG-mediated killing. Taken together, these results not only support the notion that ROS generation is related to the disturbance of ETC but also cellular respiration and energetic perturbation are involved in OG lethality.given the link between energetic perturbation and OG killing, the effect of these antioxidants (NAC and TEMPOL) on intracellular ATP was next determined.

Results in Fig. 3J shows that with the OG treatment, the specific genes of oxidative stress, sodA, soxR and soxS, were 3.47, 2.15 and 2.58 times, respectively, more expressed than in the control. The hydrogen peroxide-inducible genes, ahpC, oxyR, ahpF, oxyS and gorA were less expressed in treated cells with respect to control cells.

        <p>The electronic nose (Fig. S2) applied in the experiment was also developed by us. It consists of a sampling system, a detector containing the array of sensors, and pattern recognition for data recording. The sensor array is composed of fourteen different metal oxide sensors. Each sensor has a certain degree of affinity toward specific chemicals or volatile compounds. The sensors' response to changes in conductivity induced by the adsorption of gas-phase molecules and on subsequent surface reactions. Before the measurement, the system of the electronic nose was cleaned with zero-air which was indoor air-filtered by active carbon. The main purpose of zero-air was to clean the circuit and to return the sensors to the baselines. During the measurement of icefish, the headspace gas of a sample was pumped into the sensor chamber at a constant rate of 0.6 L/min through a tube connected to a needle. The response of each sensor was expressed as a ratio of conductance (G/G0, G and G0 are conductances of the sensors' response to the sample gas and the zero-air, respectively). The measurement procedure was controlled by a special program. The measurement time was 160 s, which was sufficient for each sensor to reach a stable value. The cleaning time was set to 100 s. The data was stored after the measurement was completed. The same sample was paralleled 5 times. Different letters in the same group of bacteria mean significant differences (P &lt; 0.05). A total of 13 fatty acids in the E. coli cell membrane and a total of 14 fatty acids in the S. aureus cell membrane were identified by GC-MS. To investigate which fatty acids were mainly responsible for discrimination between the control and samples treated with OG, the GC-MS data were processed by using an unsupervised clustering method, PCA analysis. The scores plot was generated to show the clustering of cell-membrane samples according to their fatty-acid composition, while the corresponding loading plot was produced to identify fatty acids that had a significant influence on the separation or clustering of data. As for E. coli, the first two principal components accounted for 87.08% of the total variance in the E. coli cell membrane, distributed between PC1 (72.36%) and PC2 (14.72%) positions (Fig. S7-a). Distinct clustering was found in different groups except for the control and ethanol groups, suggesting that the exposure of E. coli cells to OG may lead to systematic changes in the membrane fatty-acid composition of E. coli, while ethanol (1%) had no significant effect on them compared to the control. In the PCA model, the contribution of each fatty acid to a specific component is reflected in the loading value in the loading plot. The fatty acids with the highest loading values account for the biggest differences among cells grown at different concentrations of OG. As shown in Fig. S7-c, two variables, namely oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2), had positive loading values on PC1, implying that their contents were considerably high in the membrane of OG-treated groups. In contrast, hexadecanoic acid (C16:0) was on the negative side of both PC1 and PC2, which may reflect a low content in E.The electronic nose (Fig. S2) applied in the experiment was also developed by us.

Distinct clustering was found in different groups except for the control and ethanol groups, suggesting that the exposure of E. coli cells to OG may lead to systematic changes in the membrane fatty-acid composition of E. coli, while ethanol (1%) had no significant effect on them compared to the control. In the PCA model, the contribution of each fatty acid to a specific component is reflected in the loading value in the loading plot. The fatty acids with the highest loading values account for the biggest differences among cells grown at different concentrations of OG. As shown in Fig. S7-c, two variables, namely oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2), had positive loading values on PC1, implying that their contents were considerably high in the membrane of OG-treated groups. In contrast, hexadecanoic acid (C16:0) was on the negative side of both PC1 and PC2, which may reflect a low content in E.</p>
        <p>coli cells exposed to OG at the highest concentration (0.05 mM). Stearic acid (C18:0) was distributed on the positive side of PC2, which may be due to a high proportion of this kind of fatty acid in the cell membrane of E. coli cultivated with OG. These four fatty acids were correlated in the PC1 or PC2 space, suggesting that they were the best markers for differentiating OG-treated cells from the control.coli cells exposed to OG at the highest concentration (0.05 mM).

        <p>Likewise, for S. aureus, the first two principal components accounted for 76.95% of the total variance, distributed between PC1 (63.57%) and PC2 (13.38%) positions. Distinct clustering was also found in different groups except for the control and ethanol group (Fig. S7-b). Three variables, namely dodecanoic acid (C12:0), palmitic acid (C16:0) and octadecanoic acid (C18:0), had positive loading values on PC1 (Fig. S7-d), implying that their contents in the cell membrane were considerably high after S. aureus was incubated in the presence of OG. In contrast, anteisopentadecanic acid (anteisoC15:0), isopentadecanic acid (isoC15:0) were on the negative side of both PC1 and PC2, which may reflect a low content in S. aureus cells exposed to OG at the highest concentration (0.02 mM). Anteisoheptadecanoic acid (anteisoC17:0) was distributed on the positive side of PC2. This observation maybe because there was a high proportion of this kind of fatty acid in the cell membrane of S. aureus cultivated in the absence of OG. These five fatty acids were correlated in the PC1 or PC2 space, suggesting that they were the best markers for differentiating OG-treated cells from the control. In Fig. S12, 100 docking runs were conducted finally, 36 multimember conformational clusters were generated. Among them, the lowest energy cluster contained 5 of 100 conformations with an estimated binding energy of -7.8 kcal M -1 . The highest number cluster included 16 confirmations with a binding energy of -5.74 kcal M -1 . Ultimately those two binding models were chosen for binding-position analyses to interpret the molecular interaction mechanism of OG with DNA. OG was bound to A-T rich regions of DNA covered residues A5, A6, A7, T7, T19, T20 both in site 1 and site 2 which can be attributed to A-T regions have narrower space than G-C region and offer a better fit of small molecules into the minor groove like OG (Ketan Sahoo et al., 2008).Likewise, for S. aureus, the first two principal components accounted for 76.95% of the total variance, distributed between PC1 (63.57%) and PC2 (13.38%) positions.

        <p>The biocatalysis was carried out according to our previously published paper (Shi et al., 2017;2018) with some modifications. Briefly, the alcoholysis reactions of MG with various fatty alcohols (1-butanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, 1-decanol, 1-laurinol and 1-tetradecanol) was performed in a 30-mL glass vial using a screw-cap. MG and these aliphatic alcohols (1:6, molar ratio) were added to 10 mL of DES with water (10%, w/w). Experiments were conducted under sonochemical irradiation of 150 W, at 50 °C, for 1 h, after the addition of the lipase (CalB immo Plus, 10 mg, from Purolite Corporation, Hangzhou, China). And then the reaction vials were incubated at 60 °C, 200 rpm for 5-10 days. The supernatants were moved onto the TLC plate and HPLC equipped with a binary pump (G1312B) and Welchrom-C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Welch Materials, MD, U.S.A.). A sample of 50 µL taken out from the reaction medium was diluted with methanol of 800 mL and the internal standard of 50 mL was added to the mixture. The separation was carried out at 25 o C at 0.7 mL/min. The isocratic elution was conducted for 22 min using a mobile phase of 30A:70B (A: acetonitrile/water (70:30, v/v), B: 0.1% o-phosphoric acid). Evaporation of the solvent gave a product mixture, which was separated by silica gel column with the eluent of hexane/EA (96:4, v/v) /or crystallization. The structures of them were characterized by 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR.The biocatalysis was carried out according to our previously published paper (Shi et al., 2017;2018) with some modifications.

        <p>To determine the values of MIC and MBC, the assay was conducted according to our previously published paper (Shi et al., 2019) with slight modifications. In brief, the alkyl gallates stocks were prepared as described earlier and serially diluted in LB medium to final concentration (from 6.4 to 0.1 mM). The bacterial culture incubated overnight was diluted to approximately 10 6 CFU mL -1 in LB, and they were added into all the tubes. The tube without gallates was considered as a negative control. All tubes were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and a 1mL aliquot of the cultures treated with different concentrations of gallates was decimally diluted in 0.85% (w/v) NaCl solution, and spread-plated on LBA. The numbers of colonies were counted following 24 h incubation at 37 o C.To determine the values of MIC and MBC, the assay was conducted according to our previously published paper (Shi et al., 2019) with slight modifications.
