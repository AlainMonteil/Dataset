        <p>Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are a diverse family of complex plant secondary metabolites with many medicinal properties, including the essential anti-cancer therapeutics vinblastine and vincristine 1 . As MIAs are difficult to chemically synthesize, the world's supply chain for vinblastine relies on low-yielding extraction and purification of the precursors vindoline and catharanthine from the plant Catharanthus roseus, which is then followed by simple in vitro chemical coupling and reduction to form vinblastine at an industrial scale 2,3 . Here, we demonstrate the de novo microbial biosynthesis of vindoline and catharanthine using a highly engineered yeast, and in vitro chemical coupling to vinblastine. The study showcases a very long biosynthetic pathway refactored into a microbial cell factory, including 30 enzymatic steps beyond the yeast native metabolites geranyl pyrophosphate and tryptophan to catharanthine and vindoline. In total, 56 genetic edits were performed, including expression of 34 heterologous genes from plants, as well as deletions, knock-downs and overexpression of ten yeast genes to improve precursor supplies towards de novo production of catharanthine and vindoline, from which semisynthesis to vinblastine occurs. As the vinblastine pathway is one of the longest MIA biosynthetic pathways, this study positions yeast as a scalable platform to produce more than 3,000 natural MIAs and a virtually infinite number of new-to-nature analogues.Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are a diverse family of complex plant secondary metabolites with many medicinal properties, including the essential anti-cancer therapeutics vinblastine and vincristine 1 .

        <p>Plants produce some of the most potent human therapeutics and have been used for millennia to treat illnesses. The monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are plant secondary metabolites mostly found in Gentianales plants, bolstering a notable structural diversity and pharmaceutically valuable biological activities, with more than 3,000 MIAs derived from their common precursor strictosidine 4,5 . The MIA chemotherapeutic drugs irinotecan, vinblastine and vincristine are included in the World Health Organization list of essential medicines and exemplify some of the few established MIA therapeutics on the market, with annual market sizes of more than €1 billion (ref. 6 ). Despite the vast repertoire of MIAs with documented bioactivities, obtaining requisite amounts of MIAs needed for further development and clinical applications is often challenging because of the low yields observed in extracts from natural plant resources, as exemplified by the chemotherapeutic drugs vinblastine and vincristine requiring 500 and 2,000 kg of Catharanthus roseus dried leaves, respectively, to obtain 1 g of products 3,7,8 . Likewise, owing to the numerous stereo centres found in MIAs, multi-step synthetic chemistry holds little promise for bulk production of complex MIA therapeutics 2,9 , and thus the current vinblastine supply chains rely on extraction from C. roseus and subsequent condensation of the catharanthine and vindoline precursors 10 . As vincristine and vinblastine were listed as being drugs with a shortage in 2019-2020 by the US Food and Drug Administration 11 , there is a growing awareness of the importance of refactoring the biosynthesis of MIAs in genetically tractable heterologous hosts.Plants produce some of the most potent human therapeutics and have been used for millennia to treat illnesses.

        <p>Refactoring complex plant biosynthetic pathways of human therapeutics in microbial hosts could promise more access to plant natural products and new-to-nature derivatives thereof through scalable fermentation 12 . Indeed, baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been engineered to produce plant-derived opiates, cannabinoids, terpenes and alkaloids to treat cancer, pain, malaria and Parkinson's disease [12][13][14][15][16] . Whereas small parts of the vinblastine biosynthetic pathway have been refactored into yeast 4,[17][18][19] , only recently was the full 31-step vinblastine biosynthetic pathway from C. roseus explained 20,21 , opening up the possibility for a demonstration of a microbial supply chain for vinblastine using engineered yeast.Refactoring complex plant biosynthetic pathways of human therapeutics in microbial hosts could promise more access to plant natural products and new-to-nature derivatives thereof through scalable fermentation 12 .

        <p>The 31-step vinblastine pathway is complex, including dual inlet precursor supplies from tryptophan and geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) as well as divergence between catharanthine and vindoline supplies towards vinblastine biosynthesis 20,21 (Fig. 1). In C. roseus, the enzymes are localized in at least five compartments, namely the cytoplasm, plastid (geraniol synthase) 22 , endoplasmic reticulum (cytochrome P450s and their reductase), nucleus (strictosidine-O-β-d-glucosidase, SGD) 23 and vacuole (strictosidine synthase, STR) 23 , thus involving trafficking Stemmadenine (17) Geissoschizine (16) Strictosidine aglycone ( 15) Strictosidine ( 14) Secologanin ( 12)The 31-step vinblastine pathway is complex, including dual inlet precursor supplies from tryptophan and geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) as well as divergence between catharanthine and vindoline supplies towards vinblastine biosynthesis 20,21 (Fig. 1).

To refactor the vinblastine pathway in yeast, we divided the C. roseus pathway into three modules on the basis of substrate/product availability: a strictosidine module including G8H, 8HGO, iridoid synthase, iridoid oxidase, alcohol dehydrogenase 2, 7DLGT, 7DLH, loganic acid O-methyltransferase, secologanin synthase (SLS) and STR 4 ; a tabersonine/catharanthine module including STR (to enable strictosidine production from secologanin and tryptamine feeding), SGD, geissoschizine synthase, geissoschizine oxidase, Redox1, Redox2, SAT, O-acetylstemmadenine oxidase precondylocarpine acetate synthase (PAS), DPAS (dihydroprecondylocarpine acetate synthase), catharanthine synthase and tabersonine synthase 20 and a vinblastine module including T16H1, T16H2, 16OMT, T3O, T3R, NMT, D4H, deacetylvindoline-O-acetyltransferase 17 and PRX1 (ref. 25 ) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1).

        <p>The initial strictosidine strain MIA-AU was designed on the basis of a previously reported 12-step de novo strictosidine strain, including deletion of ATF1 and OYE2, encoding an alcohol acetyltransferase and a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidoreductase, respectively, to minimize by-product formation from geraniol 4 (Fig. 1). In addition, MIA-AU was designed to down-regulate ERG20 encoding farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase to improve the GPP:FPP ratio. However, when tested in the synthetic complete (SC) medium with all amino acids and 2% glucose, MIA-AU did not produce detectable amounts of strictosidine. Yet, when supplementing 500 μM geraniol to the medium (no higher concentration was tested owing to high toxicity of geraniol above 500 μM, Extended Data Fig. 1), MIA-AU produced 5.59 μg l -1 (10.5 nM) strictosidine, indicating geraniol precursor supply limitations (Fig. 2a). We then deleted the NADPH-dependent aldehyde reductase ARI1 and NADPH oxidoreductase OYE3, involved in syphoning 8-hydroxygeraniol and 8-oxogeranial, respectively, to shunt products 26 , resulting in strain MIA-AW-2 (Supplementary Table 2). When grown in SC medium supplemented with 500 μM geraniol, MIA-AW-2 produced 12.2 μg l -1 (23.1 nM) strictosidine (Fig. 2a).The initial strictosidine strain MIA-AU was designed on the basis of a previously reported 12-step de novo strictosidine strain, including deletion of ATF1 and OYE2, encoding an alcohol acetyltransferase and a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidoreductase, respectively, to minimize by-product formation from geraniol 4 (Fig. 1).

        <p>Acknowledging the challenges often encountered when expressing plant cytochrome P450s in microbes 27 , we first investigated the expression and subcellular localization of the four P450 enzymes of the strictosidine module, G8H, iridoid oxidase, 7DLH and SLS (Supplementary Fig. 1), each fused to a yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP). Although the fluorescence was generally low, we observed that all four P450 enzymes had correct endoplasmic reticulum membrane localization (Supplementary Fig. 1). Using targeted proteomics, we also observed poor expression of GPP synthase, FPS and geraniol synthase, which are responsible for geraniol production, as well as iridoid oxidase and SLS (Extended Data Fig. 2b), consistent with the fluorescence microscopy result, altogether suggesting several inefficient steps requiring further optimization.Acknowledging the challenges often encountered when expressing plant cytochrome P450s in microbes 27 , we first investigated the expression and subcellular localization of the four P450 enzymes of the strictosidine module, G8H, iridoid oxidase, 7DLH and SLS (Supplementary Fig. 1), each fused to a yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP).

        <p>To enable iterative engineering and refactoring of long biosynthetic pathways, we included a set of unique 20-nucleotide guide-RNA sequences in front of the promoter of each expression cassette, allowing for easy swapping of target promoters or entire expression cassettes iteratively in strain MIA-BG (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Like MIA-AU, the new platform strain MIA-BG produced 9.81 μg l -1 (18.5 nM) strictosidine when fed 100 μM geraniol and tryptamine. We supplemented the cultivation medium with tryptamine in addition to one of the precursors 8-hydroxygeraniol, 8-oxogeranial, cis-trans-nepetalactol, loganic acid, loganin or secologanin to deduce possible pathway bottlenecks. Here, when feeding 8-hydroxygeraniol, MIA-BG produced 36.7 μg l -1 (69.1 nM) strictosidine, whereas feeding 8-oxogeranial or cis-trans-nepetalactol resulted in 124 μg l -1 (233 nM) or 2.51 mg l -1 (4.73 μM) strictosidine, respectively, indicating 8HGO and iridoid synthase as the main bottlenecks. Furthermore, the highest strictosidine production in MIA-BG (6.15 mg l -1 or 11.6 μM) was achieved by feeding 100 μM secologanin (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4). However, the unused secologanin in the spent medium further suggested STR as a rate-limiting step for strictosidine production, which could be partially alleviated by the overexpression of tCroSTR from a high copy plasmid, resulting in a substantial improvement of strictosidine titre to 39.1 mg l -1 (73.7 μM), whereas 8.53 mg l -1 (21.9 μM) secologanin remained in the medium (Supplementary Fig. 2).To enable iterative engineering and refactoring of long biosynthetic pathways, we included a set of unique 20-nucleotide guide-RNA sequences in front of the promoter of each expression cassette, allowing for easy swapping of target promoters or entire expression cassettes iteratively in strain MIA-BG (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3a).

        <p>To mitigate the bottlenecks in strictosidine production, we focused first on the Pictet-Spengler-type reaction catalysed by STR by screening seven STR homologues identified from MIA-producing plants in both full-length and truncated versions (tSTR) without the N-terminal vacuolar signal peptide 4 . Individually, these variants were introduced into a strain without STR (MIA-BC), and the resulting strains were cultivated in the presence of secologanin and tryptamine. The result showed that full-length STRs yielded 2-3 times more strictosidine compared to tSTRs, with C. roseus STR (CroSTR) enabling the highest titre of 17.5 mg l -1 (32.9 μM) strictosidine (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that CroSTR was localized in the vacuole or endoplasmic reticulum membrane, while the truncated variant was localized to the nucleus in fresh cultures and shifted to the cytoplasm following overnight growth (Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting that either the substrates secologanin and tryptamine are mostly in the vacuole, or the acidic pH in the vacuole is favourable for strictosidine synthesis. Alternatively, post-translational modifications or specific folding steps encountered along the endoplasmic reticulum-to-vacuole trafficking pathway may support STR activity. Swapping the tCroSTR in MIA-BG with CroSTR (resulting in strain MIA-BJ) enabled an efficient (80%) conversion of 50 μM secologanin to 21.2 mg l -1 (40.0 μM) strictosidine, a 6.9-fold improvement over tCroSTR (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Next, to optimize the upstream steps of the strictosidine module, we screened a combinatorial library of four iridoid synthases and four cyclases (MLPs and NEPS2), which are critical enzymes involved in the cyclization of 8-oxogeranial to nepetalactol 28,29 , in strain MIA-BKV-1 (deleting CroISY from MIA-BJ) (Supplementary Table 2). When fed 100 μM 8-oxogeranial and tryptamine, strains expressing NcaML-PLA in combination with NcaISY reached the highest titres among the tested combinations, producing 2.18 mg l -1 (5.79 μM) loganic acid, 12.0 mg l -1 (30.8 μM) loganin, 1.20 mg l -1 (3.09 μM) secologanin and 1.20 mg l -1 (2.26 μM) strictosidine (42.0 μM combined) (Extended Data Fig. 6). Both NcaISY and NcaMLPLA were integrated into strain MIA-BKV-1, resulting in strain MIA-BS-5 (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, to optimize 8HGO we screened a combinatorial library of two NAD + -dependent (type-A) and four NADP + -dependent (type-B) 8HGOs in MIA-BKV-5 (deleting Cro8HGO-B from the strain MIA-BS-5). Feeding 100 μM 8-hydroxygeraniol and tryptamine to these strains we identified Vinca minor 8HGO-A (Vmi8HGO-A) as the most efficient enzyme supporting a production of 19.9 μg l -1 (248 nM) loganic acid, 20.7 μg l -1 (8.35 μM) loganin, 20.6 μg l -1 (4.07 μM) secologanin and 28.1 μg l -1 (3.64 μM) strictosidine (or 16.3 μM combined). Empty-vector control strains produced 1.86 mg l -1 (4.38 μM) of the same metabolites, indicating native yeast oxidoreductase activity on 8-hydroxygeraniol. Coexpression of 8HGO from either Rauvolfia tetraphylla (Rte8HGO-B) or Sesamum indicum (Sin8HGO-B), together with Vmi8HGO-A, had an insignificant effect, whereas coexpression of C. roseus (Cro8HGO-B) or Populus trichocarpa (Ptr8HGO-B) had a negative effect on the production, probably because Cro8HGO-B and Ptr8HGO-B catalysed the reaction in the reverse direction (Extended Data Fig. 7). Integrating Vmi8HGO-A into MIA-BKV-5 generated strain MIA-CH-A2 (Supplementary Table 2), which produced 1.32 mg l -1 (2.49 μM) strictosidine when supplemented with 100 μM geraniol and tryptamine (Fig. 2b).To mitigate the bottlenecks in strictosidine production, we focused first on the Pictet-Spengler-type reaction catalysed by STR by screening seven STR homologues identified from MIA-producing plants in both full-length and truncated versions (tSTR) without the N-terminal vacuolar signal peptide 4 .

Next, to optimize the upstream steps of the strictosidine module, we screened a combinatorial library of four iridoid synthases and four cyclases (MLPs and NEPS2), which are critical enzymes involved in the cyclization of 8-oxogeranial to nepetalactol 28,29 , in strain MIA-BKV-1 (deleting CroISY from MIA-BJ) (Supplementary Table 2).

Integrating Vmi8HGO-A into MIA-BKV-5 generated strain MIA-CH-A2 (Supplementary Table 2), which produced 1.32 mg l -1 (2.49 μM) strictosidine when supplemented with 100 μM geraniol and tryptamine (Fig. 2b).</p>
        <p>Last, to produce strictosidine de novo from glucose and tryptophan, we increased geraniol availability by dynamically down-regulating ERG9 and ERG20 (both encoding GPP consuming enzymes) using the glucose-dependent P HXT1 and P HXT3 promoters, respectively 30 , resulting in strain MIA-CL (Supplementary Table 2). We further overexpressed a specific GPP synthase encoded by AgrGPPS2 (ref. 31 ). GgaFPS N144W , which is an FPP synthase that has lower affinity for GPP 32 and an ERG20 variant (ERG20 F96W,N127W ) that shows a low FPP synthase activity 33 . We fused ERG20 F96W,N127W to tCroGES, to enhance the GPP pool and redirect it towards the first precursor, geraniol. IDI1 and truncated HMG1 (tHMG1) were overexpressed to increase the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, both precursors for GPP 4,34 . Finally, CroTDC was overexpressed to convert tryptophan to tryptamine, resulting in strain MIA-CM-5 (Supplementary Table 2). When grown in SC medium, strain MIA-CM-5 produced 7.43 mg l -1 (19.0 μM) loganin and 13.3 mg l -1 (25.0 μM) strictosidine (Fig. 2c). As glucose is depleted in 1-2 days during the 6-day cultivation, and yeast continues to use ethanol produced from glucose, we replaced the constitutively active P TEF2 and P CCW12 promoters driving expression of genes encoding AgrGPPS2 and ERG20 F96W,N127W -tCroGES fusion with glucose-repressible promoters P MLS1 and P ICL1 to avoid competition for GPP during growth on glucose and to ensure high expression on ethanol after glucose was depleted. In SC medium, MIA-CM-3 produced 15.0 mg l -1 (38.6 μM) loganin and 11.4 mg l -1 (21.5 μM) strictosidine, concentrations similar to those produced by MIA-CM-5 (Fig. 2c). However, when grown in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium, MIA-CM-3 reached 25.2 mg l -1 (47.4 μM) strictosidine, which was considerably higher than MIA-CM-5 (8.73 mg l -1 or 16.5 μM), and both MIA-CM-5 and MIA-CM-3 strains produced notably lower loganin in YPD medium compared to SC medium (Fig. 2c-d and Supplementary Fig. 4).Last, to produce strictosidine de novo from glucose and tryptophan, we increased geraniol availability by dynamically down-regulating ERG9 and ERG20 (both encoding GPP consuming enzymes) using the glucose-dependent P HXT1 and P HXT3 promoters, respectively 30 , resulting in strain MIA-CL (Supplementary Table 2). We further overexpressed a specific GPP synthase encoded by AgrGPPS2 (ref. 31 ). GgaFPS N144W , which is an FPP synthase that has lower affinity for GPP 32 and an ERG20 variant (ERG20 F96W,N127W ) that shows a low FPP synthase activity 33 . We fused ERG20 F96W,N127W to tCroGES, to enhance the GPP pool and redirect it towards the first precursor, geraniol. IDI1 and truncated HMG1 (tHMG1) were overexpressed to increase the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, both precursors for GPP 4,34 . Finally, CroTDC was overexpressed to convert tryptophan to tryptamine, resulting in strain MIA-CM-5 (Supplementary Table 2). When grown in SC medium, strain MIA-CM-5 produced 7.43 mg l -1 (19.0 μM) loganin and 13.3 mg l -1 (25.0 μM) strictosidine (Fig. 2c). As glucose is depleted in 1-2 days during the 6-day cultivation, and yeast continues to use ethanol produced from glucose, we replaced the constitutively active P TEF2 and P CCW12 promoters driving expression of genes encoding AgrGPPS2 and ERG20 F96W,N127W -tCroGES fusion with glucose-repressible promoters P MLS1 and P ICL1 to avoid competition for GPP during growth on glucose and to ensure high expression on ethanol after glucose was depleted.

        <p>Having optimized de novo strictosidine production, we next sought to express the gateway enzyme strictosidine-β-d-glucosidase (SGD), together with one-step conversion of strictosidine aglycone to tetrahydroalstonine (THA), which is not part of the main vinblastine pathway but is the shortest downstream pathway to a side product for which a chemical standard is available 35 (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Despite extensive studies on SGD, including a crystal structure of the Rauvolfia serpentina SGD (RseSGD) and functional expression of CroSGD in yeast 36 , we initially did not detect any strictosidine aglycone when expressing CroSGD alone, or THA when expressing CroSGD together with C. roseus THA synthase (CroTHAS) in strain MIA-BJ (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 5). Several attempts to express full-length or truncated CroTHAS (removing the nuclear localization sequence K 214 K 215 K 216 R 217 ) fused to full-length or truncated CroSGD (removing the C-terminal nuclear localization sequence K 537 KRFREEDKLVELVKKQKY 555 ) did not yield detectable THA production in yeast (data not shown). However, when testing 46 homologues of CroSGD, RseSGD yielded 4.02 mg l -1 (11.4 μM) THA from feeding 100 μM secologanin and 1 mM tryptamine, and another 15 homologues yielded more than 0.1 μM or 35.2 μg l -1 (0.1% yield from 100 μM secologanin feeding) THA (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Despite CroSGD being previously reported to localize to the nucleus in plant cells 35 , fluorescence microscopy of yeast cells expressing N-terminally yEGFP-tagged CroSGD and RseSGD showed different subcellular localization, with RseSGD localizing in the nucleus and CroSGD showing diffuse cytoplasmic distribution (Supplementary Fig. 6). As SGD is reported to form a protein complex in the nucleus in plant cells 35 , the cytoplasmic location of CroSGD was presumably the main reason for the lack of activity from CroSGD. The distinct protein localization/activity was surprising given the 70% protein identity between these two homologues. To investigate sequence or structural features indispensable for RseSGD function in yeast, we divided SGD into four domains on the basis of sequence conservation between RseSGD and CroSGD (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 3), and tested THA production from all possible 16 hybrid SGDs constructed from the four domains of the two SGDs. From this, we observed that the third domain from RseSGD (R 3 ), is required for SGD activity while maintaining the integrity of the third and fourth domains (R 3 +R 4 ) produced the highest amount of THA (4.69 mg l -1 or 13.3 μM) (Fig. 3c), probably contributing to SGD complex formation or correct localization in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. 6).Having optimized de novo strictosidine production, we next sought to express the gateway enzyme strictosidine-β-d-glucosidase (SGD), together with one-step conversion of strictosidine aglycone to tetrahydroalstonine (THA), which is not part of the main vinblastine pathway but is the shortest downstream pathway to a side product for which a chemical standard is available 35 (Extended Data Fig. 8a).

        <p>Next, to refactor the tabersonine/catharanthine module from C. roseus in yeast, we first constructed strain MIA-DC by integrating all ten genes from STR (to enable strictosidine production from fed secologanin and tryptamine) to tabersonine and catharanthine synthases together with CroCPR and CroCYB5 for the cytochrome P450 enzyme geissoschizine oxidase 20,21 (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 9). When fused to a C-terminally tagged yEGFP, all proteins, except for geissoschizine synthase and PAS, showed relatively strong fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 7). When fed 100 μM secologanin and 1 mM tryptamine, strain MIA-DC produced 9.29 μg l -1 (27.6 nM) tabersonine and 6.96 μg l -1 (20.7 nM) catharanthine (Extended Data Fig. 9).Next, to refactor the tabersonine/catharanthine module from C. roseus in yeast, we first constructed strain MIA-DC by integrating all ten genes from STR (to enable strictosidine production from fed secologanin and tryptamine) to tabersonine and catharanthine synthases together with CroCPR and CroCYB5 for the cytochrome P450 enzyme geissoschizine oxidase 20,21 (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 9).

        <p>In parallel, we refactored the vinblastine module (strain MIA-DE) by integrating all nine genes from tabersonine 16-hydroxylase (encoded by T16H1 and T16H2) to peroxidase PRX1, which was suggested to condense vindoline and catharanthine, together with CroCPR and CroCYB5, into a wild-type strain 17,19 (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 9). When fed 100 μM tabersonine and 100 μM catharanthine, strain MIA-DE produced 0.992 mg l -1 (2.17 μM) vindoline but no detectable vinblastine (Extended Data Fig. 9). Targeted metabolite analysis identified a strong signal for masses identical to 16-hydroxytabersonine and 16-methoxytabersonine, indicating a potential bottleneck at the P450 enzyme T3O (Extended Data Fig. 9). This was consistent with the improved vindoline production when extra copies of two consecutive genes in the vinblastine module were expressed in the MIA-DE strain, albeit with overexpression of T16H2 and 16OMT yielding the highest improvement (more than twofold) in vindoline titre compared to strain MIA-DE (Extended Data Fig. 9). Whereas strain MIA-DE did not produce vinblastine (C 46 H 58 N 4 O 9 ) from vindoline and catharanthine feeding, high-resolution MS detected a compound with formula C 46 H 56 N 4 O 9 in both wild-type and MIA-DE strains, suggesting non-enzymatic leurosine formation as also previously shown to be synthesized in vitro from catharanthine and vindoline 37,38 . Confocal microscopy analysis indicated that CroPRX1 was not expressed/folded properly (Supplementary Fig. 8), and several attempts to truncate PRX1 at the N and/or C termini did not yield any vinblastine production when cells were grown in media supplemented with 100 μM catharanthine and 100 μM vindoline. Integrating the vinblastine module into strain MIA-DC (catharanthine-tabersonine strain) yielded strain MIA-DJ, which produced 44.0 μg l -1 (130 nM) catharanthine and 4.37 μg l -1 (9.57 nM) vindoline when cultivated in YPD medium supplemented with 100 μM secologanin and 1 mM tryptamine, whereas strain MIA-DC produced 11.4 μg l -1 (34.0 nM) tabersonine and 90.8 μg l -1 (270 nM) catharanthine, indicative of catharanthine synthase having better expression or higher catalytic reactivity than tabersonine synthase (Extended Data Fig. 9). These results are in line with untargeted proteomics data showing strain MIA-DJ had relatively low expression of tabersonine synthase (Extended Data Fig. 10).In parallel, we refactored the vinblastine module (strain MIA-DE) by integrating all nine genes from tabersonine 16-hydroxylase (encoded by T16H1 and T16H2) to peroxidase PRX1, which was suggested to condense vindoline and catharanthine, together with CroCPR and CroCYB5, into a wild-type strain 17,19 (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 9).

        <p>To make tabersonine and catharanthine de novo from glucose and tryptophan, we integrated the entire tabersonine module, including RseSGD, and C. roseus geissoschizine synthase, geissoschizine oxidase, Redox1, Redox2, SAT, PAS, DPAS, tabersonine synthase (leaving out catharanthine synthase as it competes for dihydroprecondylocarpine acetate, the precursor for tabersonine synthase), into the best-performing de novo strictosidine production strain MIA-CM-3 (Fig. 2d). The resulting strain MIA-CR-A produced 11.5 μg l -1 (34.2 nM) tabersonine from YPD with 2% glucose as the only carbon source (Fig. 4b). We further integrated the seven vindoline biosynthetic genes (C. roseus T16H2, 16OMT, T3O, T3R, NMT, D4H and DAT) 17,19 into strain MIA-CR-A. The resulting strain, designated MIA-CW-1, produced 0.137 μg l -1 (0.307 nM) vindoline in YPD medium with 2% glucose (Fig. 4b).To make tabersonine and catharanthine de novo from glucose and tryptophan, we integrated the entire tabersonine module, including RseSGD, and C. roseus geissoschizine synthase, geissoschizine oxidase, Redox1, Redox2, SAT, PAS, DPAS, tabersonine synthase (leaving out catharanthine synthase as it competes for dihydroprecondylocarpine acetate, the precursor for tabersonine synthase), into the best-performing de novo strictosidine production strain MIA-CM-3 (Fig. 2d).

        <p>To enable one-pot de novo production of vindoline and catharanthine, C. roseus catharanthine synthase was integrated into strain MIA-CW-1 under the control of a galactose inducible (P GAL1 ) promoter. Extra copies of the ERG20**-tCroGES fusion and AgrGPPS2 were integrated to boost geraniol synthesis. To enhance the conversion of the unstable and highly reactive intermediate strictosidine aglycone 23 to geissoschizine and its oxidation, we also integrated an extra copy of CroGS, CroGO and CroCPR, resulting in the strain MIA-EM-1. Using biphasic fermentation with glucose and galactose as carbon sources, MIA-EM-1 produced 2.32 μg l -1 (5.08 nM) vindoline and 26.6 μg l -1 (79.1 nM) catharanthine de novo (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 10). We further constructed strain MIA-EM-2 by integrating an extra copy of each of the six tabersonine module genes, namely CroGS, CroGO, CroSAT, CroPAS, CroDPAS and CroTS, into strain MIA-EM-1. Similarly, we constructed MIA-EM-3 by integrating an extra copy of CroTS as well as the vindoline module genes (CroT16H2, CroT3O, CroT3R, CroD4H and CroDAT) (Extended Data Fig. 10). Under the same fed-batch cultivation condition, strain MIA-EM-2, which had an enhanced tabersonine module, produced 5.48 μg l -1 (12.0 nM) vindoline and 69.4 μg l -1 (206 nM) catharanthine (Extended Data Fig. 10). On the other hand, strain MIA-EM-3 (with a further copy of vindoline module genes) produced 4.19 μg l -1 (9.18 nM) vindoline and only one out of three colonies produced 6.46 μg l -1 (19.2 nM) catharanthine (Extended Data Fig. 10), indicating that the main bottleneck was still within the tabersonine/ catharanthine module and further enhancing the vindoline module expression was detrimental to catharanthine production because of a stronger pull of dihydroprecondylocarpine acetate, which is also a precursor to catharanthine (Fig. 1). Subsequently, strain MIA-EM-2 was grown in fed-batch cultivation in ambr 250 bioreactors, with continuous feeding of 3× SC containing 2% glucose and 3 mM tryptophan (between 20 and 72 h), and daily dosing of 3 g l -1 galactose during days 4-10. Samples were collected every 24 h to analyse the MIA metabolites. At the end of the fermentation (day 11), the catharanthine and vindoline titres reached 91.4 μg l -1 (271 nM) and 13.2 μg l -1 (29.0 nM), respectively (Extended Data Fig. 11 and Supplementary Fig. 9).To enable one-pot de novo production of vindoline and catharanthine, C. roseus catharanthine synthase was integrated into strain MIA-CW-1 under the control of a galactose inducible (P GAL1 ) promoter.

        <p>Vindoline and catharanthine can be enzymatically coupled using a peroxidase and peroxide as demonstrated previously 25 , chemically coupled using Fe(III) 2 or photo-chemically coupled using near-UV radiation in the presence of flavin mononucleotide 38 . The enzymatic coupling using horseradish peroxidase did not yield a detectable amount of vinblastine (data not shown), and we could only produce 336 μg l -1 (414 nM) and 397 μg l -1 (490 nM) vinblastine from pure catharanthine (100 μM) and vindoline (10 μM) standards using the Fe(III)-based coupling and photo-chemical methods, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 12). Also, attempts to couple yeast-produced catharanthine and vindoline (after liquid-liquid extraction and roughly 750-fold concentration of the compounds, see Supplementary Methods) using the Fe(III) method was unsuccessful (data not shown), presumably because of unspecific coupling to by-products or a strong suppression of vinblastine signal by the complex matrix concentrated from the fermentation broth. However, following purification using thin-layer chromatography and subsequent preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Supplementary Methods), we could detect 23.9 μg l -1 (29.4 nM) vinblastine using the Fe(III) coupling method (Extended Data Fig. 12).Vindoline and catharanthine can be enzymatically coupled using a peroxidase and peroxide as demonstrated previously 25 , chemically coupled using Fe(III) 2 or photo-chemically coupled using near-UV radiation in the presence of flavin mononucleotide 38 .

        <p>Here we report the optimization of the strictosidine biosynthetic pathway by more than 1,000-fold, reaching titres of 25.2 mg l -1 (47.4 μM) in 96-well plates (Fig. 2d). From this, we demonstrated de novo production of catharanthine and vindoline, with the 30-step vindoline pathway representing a very long heterologous pathway refactored in a microbial cell. Furthermore, and in alignment with industrial scale manufacturing of vinblastine, catharanthine and vindoline were purified from fermentation broths and chemically coupled to form vinblastine (Extended Data Fig. 12). Although we were unable to make vinblastine directly in yeast (as CroPRX1 proved difficult to express in yeast as indicated by proteomics analysis of the MIA-DJ strain), our microbial process mimics the plant-based production process, which relies on coupling vindoline and catharanthine after their purification from C. roseus leaves. Although it may one day be possible to identify a PRX1 homologue that successfully catalyses the reaction when compartmentalized in the peroxisome, nevertheless this study provides a demonstration of a microbial supply chain for a complex essential anti-cancer medicine. Microbial supply chains for essential medicines with few other suppliers, long lead times and high manufacturing complexity, are viable solutions to secure the global or regional supply of these drugs, especially during unpredictable environmental events, such as natural disaster, plant disease and pandemics 39 . This said, further metabolic engineering and bioprocess optimization are needed for engineered yeast to supplement and ultimately stabilize existing C. roseus-based vinblastine supply chains. Specifically, the tabersonine/catharanthine module, which had many promiscuous reactions, potential host-heterologous pathway interactions and protein aggregation, was particularly challenging 20 . Furthermore, expression of the seven P450 enzymes could be further optimized, or they could be replaced with better homologues. Likewise, de novo vindoline production required more deletion, knockdown and overexpression of ten native yeast genes to improve precursor supplies, which also need to be regulated to ensure balanced cell growth and production in future process optimizations. Having said this, we consider both the strictosidine platform, and the demonstration of one-pot de novo vindoline and catharanthine production ripe for new MIA pathway discoveries as well as production and bioactivity testing of new unnatural MIA analogues with higher potency and/or efficacy, such as 10-fluoro-vinblastine 40 , in yeast cell factories.Here we report the optimization of the strictosidine biosynthetic pathway by more than 1,000-fold, reaching titres of 25.2 mg l -1 (47.4 μM) in 96-well plates (Fig. 2d).
