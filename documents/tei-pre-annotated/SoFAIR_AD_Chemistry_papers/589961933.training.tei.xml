        <p>Resource economy constitutes one of the key challenges for researchers and practitioners in academia and industries, in terms of rising demand for sustainable and green synthetic methodology. To achieve ideal levels of resource economy in molecular syntheses, novel avenues are required, which include, but are not limited to the use of naturally abundant, renewable feedstocks, solvents, metal catalysts, energy, and redox reagents. In this context, electrosyntheses create the unique possibility to replace stoichiometric amounts of oxidizing or reducing reagents as well as electron transfer events by electric current. Particularly, the merger of Earth-abundant 3d metal catalysis and electrooxidation has recently been recognized as an increasingly viable strategy to forge challenging C-C and C-heteroatom bonds for complex organic molecules in a sustainable fashion under mild reaction conditions. In this review, we highlight the key developments in 3d metallaelectrocatalysis in the context of resource economy in molecular syntheses until February 2020.Resource economy constitutes one of the key challenges for researchers and practitioners in academia and industries, in terms of rising demand for sustainable and green synthetic methodology.

        <p>In the last few decades, significant attention has been paid to the development of sustainable strategies for molecular assembly in terms of both economic and environmental benefits. 1 In 1991, Trost proposed the concept of atom economy and highlighted the value of transition metal catalysis towards this goal. 2,3 Later, Anastas and Warner introduced the twelve principles of green chemistry in 1998 to provide guidelines for minimizing the environmental footprint of chemical syntheses. 4 Further, the principles of step economy 5 and redox economy have been put forward. 6,7 In contrast, resource economy aims to provide a basis for designing fully sustainable methodologies of molecular syntheses. 8 These principles are reflected by the development of the corresponding techniques (Fig. 1a). Considering the transformation of two organic reactants with the corresponding reactive groups, the crosscoupling catalysis was developed. C-H activation allowed the use of even less functionalized starting materials. [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] Metallaphotocatalysis offers the potential to drive catalytic processes from solar energy.

        <p>Considering its natural abundance, the use of molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant in transition metal-oxidase catalysis continues to be of topical interest. [36][37][38] Despite the improved sustainability and resource economy, the use of oxygen is on the one hand limited by its fixed oxidation potential. On the other hand, and more importantly, major safety hazards in view of flammable reaction media in large scale syntheses need to be addressed, rendering this approach challenging particularly for scale-up. 39 As a consequence, in recent years, photoredox catalysis has emerged as a strategy to affect redox processes in transition metal catalysis in a mild and selective manner. [40][41][42][43][44][45] These transformations are mostly based on noble iridium or ruthenium complexes as the photoredox catalyst (PC) to convert light into chemical energy. It is noteworthy that each PC offers only a unique fixed redox potential and therefore the use and synthesis of specifically tailored PCs are essential to realize the desired redox transformation (Fig. 2, top). The synthetic modification of PCs to adjust the redox potential typically demands labor-and costintensive multistep transformations. Though the power of photoredox catalysis has evidently been demonstrated for transition metal catalysis, 46 the quantum yields of these transformations are typically low when employing visible light, and natural sunlight can normally not be used, because of the narrow absorption range of the PCs. In contrast, high power LEDs or Kessil LED lights are often necessary for satisfactory efficacy.Considering its natural abundance, the use of molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant in transition metal-oxidase catalysis continues to be of topical interest.

        <p>When an electrode is immersed in a solution of a half-cell, the difference between the solution's and the electrode material's electrochemical potential leads to a charge separation at the electrode-electrolyte interface originating from the systems attempt to reach equilibrium. It is extremely challenging to experimentally determine the value of this electrochemical potential difference. Two distinct half-cells will differ in the amount of charge that accumulates on the electrode surface. If these two half cells are connected, without allowing a flow of electric charge, this difference between the two equilibrium electrode potentials can be measured as an electric potential difference with a voltmeter. The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) has been chosen as a reference system and its equilibrium electrode potential was defined as 0 V by convention. Therefore, by measuring any cell versus the SHE, the equilibrium electrode potential of the specific half-cell can be determined. The Nernst -eqn (I) relates the potential of a half-cell to the activity of the corresponding species of the redox couple: Instead of the activities, the respective concentrations are commonly used as an approximation. As soon as current flows and an electrochemical reaction occurs, the Nernst-Equation is no longer valid.When an electrode is immersed in a solution of a half-cell, the difference between the solution's and the electrode material's electrochemical potential leads to a charge separation at the electrode-electrolyte interface originating from the systems attempt to reach equilibrium.

        <p>According to Ohm's law, the potential is proportional to the current with the resistance (R) being the constant of proportionality (U = RÁI). This implies that only one of these values can be preset in an experiment, while the second one will adapt according to the cell's resistance. The first option is to keep the current constant (CCE = constant current electrolysis). This results in a potential difference between the electrodes, which enables the charge to pass through the cell at this specific rate. This option is advantageous in terms of directly controlling the amount of charge accompanied by a simple setup. However, during an electrochemical synthesis, the potential will typically increase, while the reactants are consumed and the cell resistance rises. This may lead to undesired side reactions and will decrease the current efficiency towards high substrate conversions (Fig. 3a). Alternatively, a fixed potential can be applied (CPE = constant potential electrolysis), which results in an adapting current. This can allow more chemo-selective transformations with high current efficiency so that ideally only the desired transformation takes place. However, during the electrosynthesis the current decreases due to depletion of the reactants and accordingly the reaction slows down (Fig. 3b). Additionally, a CPE requires more sophisticated equipment. A reference electrode as a third electrode in the electrochemical cell is mandatory to reliably control the working electrode's potential. At the reference electrode no electrochemical reaction takes place and no electric current flows. If the potential of one electrode is measured versus the live counter electrode, an unknown overpotential (vide infra) arises. The reference electrode must be chosen according to the system at hand. For aqueous electrolyte mixtures, Hg/Hg 2 Cl 2 (calomel) or Ag/AgCl reference electrodes are well suited. For short reaction times, these can usually be applied in organic reaction media as well. Several organic solvent-based Ag/Ag(I) reference electrodes have also been developed. For a first approximation, it can be sufficient to use an inert metal wire as a pseudo reference electrode. It has to be taken into account, though, that an alteration of the metal surface or the solvent pH and composition may lead to a change of the inherent potential of the reference electrode in the electrolyte. This ultimately leads to a drift of the reference potential and reduces the accuracy with which the potential is kept constant.According to Ohm's law, the potential is proportional to the current with the resistance (R) being the constant of proportionality (U = RÁI).

        <p>The electrolyte in electrolytic cells mostly consists of a conducting agent dissolved in an organic solvent or aqueous media. Overall there are few limitations regarding the choice of solvents for electrosynthesis. However, in addition to the usual aspects of solvent selection for chemical reactions, such as polarity, boiling point, coordination behavior and solubility of reactants and reagents -to name a few -also the stability towards electrolysis and electro-generated reactive intermediates as well as the conductivity are of prime importance. Usually, conducting agents have to be employed to decrease the resistance of the electrolyte. The same restrictions as for the solvent apply. Most importantly, the electrolyte mixture should be electrochemically stable within the potential window that is needed for the desired transformation. Information regarding the stability of common electrolyte mixtures in terms of the applied potential can be found elsewhere. 60 Electrolytic cells can be differentiated depending on whether a divided or undivided setup is employed (Fig. 4). In an undivided cell the electrodes are in the same compartment of the reaction vessel and all species in solution can diffuse freely between the electrodes. In contrast, in a divided cell the anode and cathode compartments are separated by a semi-permeable, often ion-selective membrane or a glass frit of very fine porosity. These barriers allow for the diffusion of small ions for the necessary charge transport but hinder the diffusion of larger molecules. Thereby, sensitive species reacting or being formed at the one electrode, are protected from the counter electrode itself and the majority of thus-formed by-products. The undivided cell setup comes in general at a lower price and is easily constructed from almost any reaction vessel in a synthetic lab.The electrolyte in electrolytic cells mostly consists of a conducting agent dissolved in an organic solvent or aqueous media.

        <p>Whereas the reaction between a chemical oxidant (or reductant) 61 and a substrate is usually a homogeneous process between two dissolved species, the electrooxidation of a substrate is always occurring at an electrode surface in a heterogeneous surface process. This leads to a series of effects, which result in an overpotential for the respective redox event.Whereas the reaction between a chemical oxidant (or reductant) 61 and a substrate is usually a homogeneous process between two dissolved species, the electrooxidation of a substrate is always occurring at an electrode surface in a heterogeneous surface process.

        <p>However, in certain cases, the overpotential can also be exploited for the tailoring the reactions. For instance, platinum metal is characterized by a very low overpotential for the formation of hydrogen gas by proton reduction. Therefore, using a platinum cathode is effective in promoting hydrogen formation and suppressing other possibly undesired cathodic reductions. The use of platinum as the electrode material, albeit costly, takes a little toll on the resource economy as the electrode is reusable. However, nickel and iron both show low overpotentials for hydrogen formation as well and may be more resource economic alternatives, where possible.However, in certain cases, the overpotential can also be exploited for the tailoring the reactions.

        <p>A high overpotential can also be circumvented by using a mediator for indirect electrolysis of the substrate (Fig. 5). In direct electrolysis, the substrate is oxidized at the electrode surface. An indirect electrolysis 62 is characterized by the substrate being oxidized by a second dissolved species, which in turn is oxidized at the anodic surface. The redox mediator, which is usually employed in catalytic amounts, acts as an electron shuttle between the electrode and the substrate. This strategy may allow more selective transformations if the overpotential needed for direct electrolysis of the substrate is significantly higher than that for the oxidation of the redox mediator. In terms of resource economy, the use of a redox mediator is in principle unfavorable, as it decreases the atom economy. However, potential benefits like the decreased formation of side products and less energy consumption have to be carefully considered in the individual case.A high overpotential can also be circumvented by using a mediator for indirect electrolysis of the substrate (Fig. 5).

[64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71][72][73] Although a few examples have been known since the 1990's for electrochemical organometallic difunctionalization of olefins, such as epoxidations by manganese salen complexes, 74,75 and dihydroxylations using osmium catalysts, 76,77 this area of research has gained significant momentum by the exciting work involving manganese-catalyzed diazidation of alkenes 1 as reported by Lin and coworkers in 2017 (Scheme 1). 78 Supported by mechanistic studies, a Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox cycle has been proposed for this electrochemical radical alkene difunctionalization (Scheme 1b). The mechanism involves the formation of a [Mn(II)]-N 3 coordination compound, which is oxidized to [Mn(III)]-N 3 and then transfers N 3 to the alkene, regenerating the [Mn(II)] species. In a second analogous sequence the product 2 is generated. The reaction proved compatible with terminal, 1,1-and 1,2-disubstituted, trisubstituted, and tetrasubstituted olefins to provide the desired 1,2-diazides 2 in high yields. The mild electrocatalytic reaction conditions offered high chemoselectivity and various synthetically meaningful functional groups, such as ester, alcohol, ketone, carboxylic acid, and amine, on the alkene moiety were well tolerated (Scheme 1c). The resource economy of the reaction is substantiated by the Earth-abundant manganese catalyst, a high faradaic efficiency (66-87%), high atom economy, and hydrogen and sodium acetate as benign by-products. In a related study, the authors also accomplished the dichlorination of alkenes 1 with MgCl 2 as the chlorine source under mild reaction conditions. 79 It is worth mentioning that the diazidation of alkenes 1 has subsequently also been realized under transition metal free reaction conditions using aminoxyl radical catalyst, CHAMPO. 80 The versatile metallaelectrocatalysis was further applied to the heterodifunctionalization of alkenes 1 (Scheme 2). 81 Thus, the manganese-catalyzed electrochemical reaction conditions enabled the synthetically valuable chlorotrifluoromethylation of alkenes 1 using commercially available bench-stable MgCl 2 , and CF 3 SO 2 Na (Langlois reagent) as the Cl and CF 3 source, respectively. The proposed catalytic cycle involves the anodic generation of the CF 3 radical and [Mn(III)]-Cl (Scheme 2b). Subsequently, the CF 3 attacks the alkene to generate a transient carbon-centered radical species 5, which is trapped within a radical coupling with [Mn(III)]-Cl to provide the desired chlorotrifluoromethylation product 4. The electrocatalytic conditions conveniently transformed diversely substituted alkenyl substrates 1 into the desired products 4 at ambient reaction temperature (Scheme 2c). Interestingly, the difunctionalization of 1,6-enyne substrates 6 afforded chlorotrifluoromethylated pyrrolidines under only slightly modified reaction conditions. 82 Here, the presence of the bidentate ligand 2,2 0 -bipyridine (bpy) significantly enhanced the stereo control of the alkenyl group in the pyrrolidine products 7 (Scheme 3).Transition metal catalysis has the power to improve the control of the reaction chemo-selectivity and thus can expand reaction scope and synthetic utility.

        <p>During the past decades, palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings have emerged as promising and widely used reactions to forge C-C and C-heteroatom bonds in drug molecules and functional materials. [84][85][86][87] Particularly, C-N forming reactions are often required in API syntheses. [88][89][90] In view of the high cost and low natural occurrence of palladium, significant efforts have been devoted to enable these cross-coupling reactions using Earth-abundant nickel catalysts.

        <p>The merger of C-H activation and electrochemistry set the stage to establish new reactivities with high levels of resource economy. Despite indisputable advances, electrocatalytic organometallic C-H activations were thus far limited to precious palladium catalysts 103 and N-coordination as evidenced by Jutand, 103 Kakiuchi [104][105][106][107] and Mei, [108][109][110][111] among others. 52,109,[112][113][114][115] Very recently, electrochemical organometallic C-H activation reactions employing rhodium(III), [116][117][118][119][120] iridium(III), 121,122 and less expensive ruthenium(II) [123][124][125][126][127] complexes have been accomplished by Ackermann and others. Hence, cost-intensive precious transition metals have until very recently proven mandatory. In contrast, we illustrate the huge potential of merging 3d metal catalysts with electrochemistry to achieve unprecedented reactivities in C-H activation reactions towards full resource economy. 56,128 4.3.1 Cobaltaelectro-catalyzed C-H activation. In 2017, the Ackermann group reported the merger of cobalt-catalyzed C-H activation and electro-reoxidation of the cobalt catalyst as the key step of the catalytic cycle. 54 This proof of concept study realized the direct C-H oxygenation of aryl and alkenyl amides 38 with inexpensive and Earth-abundant Co(OAc) 2 Á4H 2 O as the catalyst (Scheme 10). The key features of the method concerning resource economy include, (i) Earth-abundant 3d metal catalyst, (ii) cost-effective commercial cobalt salt being devoid of the costly Cp*-ancillary ligand, 129,130 (iii) no stoichiometric, hazardous metal oxidants, (iv) ambient reaction temperature of 23 1C, and (v) benign H 2 as the sole by-product. Notably, the cobaltaelectro-catalyzed C-H oxygenation was also feasible in bio-based g-valerolactone (GVL) as the solvent, 131,132 which further substantiated the green nature of the C-H activation protocol. 133 activation to form cobalt(III) intermediate 41 followed oxidation induced C-O bond forming reductive elimination from cobalt(IV) species 42 resulted the desired product 40 and the cobalt(II) complex 43. The cobalt(II) species 44 is reoxidized to the active cobalt(III) species 41 by anodic oxidation. The detailed cyclovoltammetric studies unraveled the formation of a cobalt(III) and cobalt(IV) species by anodic oxidations. Thus, the oxidation potential of 1.19 V SCE was determined for the oxidation of cobalt(II) to cobalt(III) from the mixture of Co(OAc) 2 , and NaOPiv in MeOH, whereas the oxidation potential of cobalt(III) complex 41 was found to be E p,ox = 0.95 V SCE . 134 The oxidation potential of substrate 38a was found to be significantly higher (1.51 V SCE ) than that of cobalt(II)/cobalt(III) or cobalt(III)/cobalt(IV) redox potentials. 54 The cobaltaelectro-catalyzed C-H activation was not limited to C-O bond forming reactions. Thus, Ackermann established an intermolecular C-H amination protocol under mild reaction conditions (Scheme 12). 135 A variety of benzamides 38 bearing pyridine N-oxide (PyO) substituents were efficiently orthoaminated with secondary amines 13 to afford the desired products 45 in good yields, while liberating H 2 as the sole by-product. The formation of H 2 was unambiguously confirmed by headspace gas chromatography (GC), and could be utilized for future hydrogen evolution reaction strategies (HER).

        <p>Very recently, the Ackermann group reported the first example of organometallic C-H activation for C-N formation by nickellaelectrocatalysis. 158 Thus, the ortho-selective C-H amination of amides 75 with a variety of secondary amines 13 was achieved using the commercially available nickel salt Ni(DME)Cl 2 (Scheme 25). The CV studies performed with a mixture of Ni(DME)Cl 2 , NaOPiv and substrate 75 in DMA showed a redox potential of 0.26 V vs. Fc + /Fc for the nickel(II)/nickel(III) event. Furthermore, the measurements after preheating at 120 1C for 30 min gave an oxidation wave at E p = 0.49 V vs. Fc +/0 , which is indicative of a nickel(IV) species. Based on these CV data and other kinetic studies, the authors proposed a plausible reaction pathway to involve a Ni(III)/Ni(IV)/Ni(II) manifold (Scheme 25b). 158 C-O forming transformations are of utmost importance for the synthesis of bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals and functional materials. [159][160][161][162] In this context, the Ackermann group very recently devised a resource-economical nickellaelectrocatalysis strategy for the oxidative C-H alkoxylations with challenging secondary alcohols 91 with H 2 as the only stoichiometric byproduct in lieu of stoichiometric chemical oxidants (Scheme 26). 163 The reaction was conveniently achieved using inexpensive and bench-stable nickel salt Ni(DME)Cl 2 as the catalyst under economically robust undivided electrochemical cell setup. The versatile nickellaelectro-catalytic reaction conditions compatible with a wide variety of secondary alcohols including alicyclic, cyclic, benzylic and heterocyclic alcohols to give the desired alkoxylation products in excellent yields. Notably, the naturally-occurring alcohols menthol, cholesterol and b-estradiol were found to be compatible without racemization at the stereogenic centers. 4.3.4 Ferraelectro-catalyzed C-H activation. During the last decade, iron catalysts have been considered as an outstanding for sustainable molecular syntheses via C-H activation, because of its natural Earth-abundance, low toxicity and cost-effective nature. 34,164,165 Despite indisputable advances, the iron-catalyzed oxidative C-H transformation reactions strongly relied on superstoichiometric amounts of expensive 1,2-dichloroisobutane (DCIB) as the sacrificial oxidant. To overcome this major limitation, the Ackermann group disclosed the unprecedented ferraelectro catalytic approach for oxidative C-H activation. 166 Here, the regioselective ortho C-H arylation of amides 93 was achieved under DCIB-free reaction conditions using electricity as environmentally-benign oxidant (Scheme 27). Detailed experimental, spectroscopic, and DFT mechanistic studies yielded insights into an electrooxidative iron(II/III/I) manifold.Very recently, the Ackermann group reported the first example of organometallic C-H activation for C-N formation by nickellaelectrocatalysis. 158 Thus, the ortho-selective C-H amination of amides 75 with a variety of secondary amines 13 was achieved using the commercially available nickel salt Ni(DME)Cl 2 (Scheme 25).

        <p>Resource economy in molecular syntheses has gained significant momentum in recent years concerning the rising demand for sustainable strategies for molecular syntheses. The merger of electrochemistry with Earth-abundant 3d metal catalysis enabled the construction of challenging C-C and C-heteroatom bonds for complex organic molecules in a sustainable fashion under exceedingly mild reaction conditions. The metallaelectrocatalysis utilizes electro-oxidation/reduction in lieu of reactive chemical redox reagents, and thereby prevents undesired waste formation. Particularly, electricity from renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, features unique potential for the ideal step and redox economy. The potential of sustainable electrochemical 3d metal catalysis in molecular synthesis is herein highlighted with three key case studies. Thus, the recent developments of alkene difunctionalizations by manganese catalysts under electrochemical conditions set the stage for the syntheses of synthetically meaningful vicinally difunctionalized products (Case Study I). Electrochemical nickel-catalyzed crosscouplings proceeded under ambient reaction conditions to forge C-N, C-S and C-P bonds (Case Study II). Remarkably, the merger of 3d metal electrochemistry and C-H activation enabled excellent oxidant economy by using electricity as green oxidant and generates molecular hydrogen as the sole by-product (Case Study III). The metallaelectrocatalysis using 3d metal catalysts, such as cobalt, copper, nickel, iron and manganese, proceeded under mild reaction conditions with broad substrate scope. These metallaelectro-catalyzed C-H activations often proceeded in green reaction media, ensuring the high levels of sustainability. In sharp contrast to noble metal electrocatalyses, 103,107,110,111,167,168 most of the 3d metallaelectro-catalyzed organic syntheses could be accomplished in an user-friendly, undivided electrochemical cell setup. Likewise, the electrochemical cross-couplings by nickel catalyst involving cathodic reduction of the metal catalyst were conveniently performed in an undivided cell, provided that nickel electrodes were used (Case Study II). Given the unique features of 3d metallaelectrocatalysis in terms of resource economy, further advances are expected in this rapidly emerging research area, including enantioselective transformations, dual metallaelectrocatalysis, and electrocatalytic C-C and C-heteroatom activations.Resource economy in molecular syntheses has gained significant momentum in recent years concerning the rising demand for sustainable strategies for molecular syntheses.
