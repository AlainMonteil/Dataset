On the other hand, to evaluate the coordination reaction time between the probe and copper(II), as the Cu 2+ is added, the fluorescence intensity gradually decreased until a balance was reached within 15min (Figure S8).

In conclusion, we present a novel"turn-off"type AIEE fluorescence probe containing a pyridine-2,6dicarboxamide core and two TPE moieties linked via a phenylenediamine bridge, which acts as a selective sensor for copper(II) in THF/water mixtures, as well as in real water samples. Also the probe offers a convenient "naked-eye"detection method for Cu(II) ion detection and the detection limit is as low as 2.36×10 -7 mol•L -1 . UV-vis and NMR spectra shows that the probe adopts a 1:2 binding mode with the copper centre, with a binding constant of 3.3388×10 3 mol•L -1 , and the result is agreement with the single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. We believe our research provides an example of an AIEgen probe for Cu(II) detection in practical applications, and moreover, the basic molecular framework of the ligand can be further functionalized to make it specific for other analytes. Such studies are currently on-going in our laboratory. Experimental General: 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra (400 MHz) were recorded on a Inova-400 Bruker AV 400 spectrometer using chloroform-d solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. J-values are given in Hz. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were taken on a GCT premier CAB048 mass spectrometer operating in a MALDI-TOF mode. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a UV-2600 Milton Ray Spectrofluorometer. PL spectra were recorded on a Cary eclipse Hitachi 4500 spectrofluorometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi scanning electron microscope. X-ray Crystallography: Crystallographic data for TPE-An-Py were collected on a Bruker APEX 2 CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) in the ωscan mode. [36] The structures were solved by a charge flipping algorithm and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2.As shown in figure 2, the fluorescence intensity of probe TPE-An-Py exhibited a remarkable emission quenching at 598 nm accompanied by a colour change from bright to weak under UV irradiation (λ ex = 365nm). The recoveries were calculated in the range 106%~111% for lake water and 97%~108% in tap water for Cu 2+ . Thus, the high selectivity and specificity of the probe TPE-An-Py means it could be used for monitoring Cu 2+ in a water environment.
