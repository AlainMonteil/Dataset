        <p>This increasing demand is driving dairy processors to become more competitive and streamline processes to be more efficient. To achieve this, it is essential for dairy plants to implement real-time process monitoring to allow corresponding production lines to be controlled and optimised, while also ensuring the production of a high quality and consistent final product. The acquisition of real-time process information (i.e., operating conditions, quality attributes of processed materials) can be achieved by implementation of process analytical technologies (PAT) in the manufacturing processes. The concept of PAT was first introduced to the pharmaceutical industry by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 2004), with the aim of supporting innovation and efficiency in pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, and quality assurance.

In recent decades, the importance for real-time measurement of chemical composition of in-process materials has been recognised by dairy processors as an important component to ensure end products meet desired quality specifications (Munir et al., 2017). For example, the protein-to-fat ratio (PFR) of cheese milk governs the coagulation process, cheese yield and final composition of the cheese (Sturaro, De Marchi, Zorzi, &amp; Cassandro, 2015).

        <p>Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been identified as a powerful analytical technology for compositional analysis of a variety of dairy products, since its first application in the dairy industry in the late 1970s (Cattaneo &amp; Holroyd, 2013). This technique can overcome the disadvantages of timeconsuming and tedious laboratory analysis, offering a rapid (results derived in seconds), non-destructive (no sample damage), cost-effective (simultaneously measure multiple quality parameters) and environmentally-friendly (chemical-free and no waste disposal required) solution to meet the requirements of a fast-paced processing supply chain. In 2006, the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) together with IDF published an international standard, providing guidelines for the application of NIR spectrometry as an off-line analytical technology for quality measurement of several milk products (ISO &amp; IDF, 2006). This standard was substantially updated and revised in 2019 to cover a wider range of dairy samples in different forms (i.e., liquid, semi-solid and solid). In addition, a Bulletin of the IDF (No. 497/2019) entitled "Applications of NIR spectrometry for the analysis of milk and milk products" was recently released (Niemöller &amp; Holroyd, 2019). This document summarised unpublished calibration statistics originating from global dairy companies and NIR instrument vendors, to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on NIR performance in the dairy industry. To meet current process requirements of quality by design (QbD), the latest NIR instruments are equipped with features that are suitable for real-time (on-line or in-line) process monitoring.

        <p>Both NIR and MIR spectroscopy are considered as rapid and chemical-free technologies. Table 1 compares NIR and MIR spectroscopy. NIR spectroscopy is more attractive for on-line and in-line applications since: (i) the NIR region has higher energy than MIR (as known from Equation 1) resulting in a larger penetration depth into the sample; (ii) NIR light can pass through materials such as glass, films and plastic materials without losing much energy, giving a major advantage over the MIR in measuring samples through these materials (Lin, Rasco, Cavinato, &amp; Al-Holy, 2009); (iii) The NIR spectrum contains a large amount of information related to the overtone and combination bands of hydrogen bonds (i.e., C-H, O-H and N-H). Most organic materials are made of these bonds, allowing a wide range of organic samples in chemistry, pharmaceutical and agri-food industries to be suitable for NIR analysis (Manley, 2014). For example, the N-H vibration bands presented in the NIR spectrum of a milk sample are mainly corresponding to the protein molecules.Both NIR and MIR spectroscopy are considered as rapid and chemical-free technologies.

        <p>Nevertheless, NIR spectroscopy has its limitations. The NIR spectra are made up of overtones and combination bands of chemical bonds, the peaks are broad and overlapped which makes the spectral interpretation more difficult. NIR data exploration and interpretation rely heavily on the use of multivariate data analysis (chemometrics). The NIR technology cannot measure constituents/contaminations (e.g., melamine) that are lower than 0.1%, as a trace amount of contamination will have no measurable effect on the scatter properties of the samples (Norris, 2009).Nevertheless, NIR spectroscopy has its limitations.

        <p>The interactions between light and matter include absorbance, reflectance and transmittance, as shown in Fig. 2. When the light (located in the NIR region) is passing through the sample, some parts of the light can be absorbed by the sample causing molecular vibrations, and the rest of the light is either reflected back towards the sample or transmitted through the sample, or a combination of both depending on the sample properties (i.e. sample density and chemical compounds).The interactions between light and matter include absorbance, reflectance and transmittance, as shown in Fig. 2.

        <p>According to the specific light-output captured by the detector in an NIR instrument, NIR spectroscopy can be performed in transmittance, reflectance, and transflectance (a mixture of transmittance and reflectance) mode, as shown in Fig. 3. The transmittance mode measures the light transmitted through a sample, with the detector located at the opposite side of the light source. The reflectance mode measures the light reflected by the sample, with the detector located on the same side of the light source. For the transflectance mode, a gold reflector (functioning as a mirror) is placed at the bottom of the sample, the transmitted light will be reflected back once it reaches the gold reflector (Núñez-Sánchez et al., 2016). As the light travels through the sample twice, the optical pathlength is double the sample thickness.According to the specific light-output captured by the detector in an NIR instrument, NIR spectroscopy can be performed in transmittance, reflectance, and transflectance (a mixture of transmittance and reflectance) mode, as shown in Fig. 3.

        <p>In dairy applications, for example, NIR light can penetrate through skim milk liquid easily, thus, the transmission spectra will provide more detailed compositional information on the sample. Compared with whole milk that has a fat content of 3~5%, light scattering effect could be observed due to the presence of different fat globules (Chen, Iyo, Terada, &amp; Kawano, 2002), as a result, NIR spectrometers operating in either reflectance or transmittance can be considered for whole milk compositional measurement (Aernouts, Polshin, Lammertyn, &amp; Saeys, 2011). Milk powders have a strong diffuse reflectance of the light, as a result, the reflectance spectrum carries more sample information compared with the transmission spectrum. The transflectance mode is very useful in applications where there is a significant physical and chemical change in the in-process materials. For example, in the fermentation process of yoghurt, the rheology of the in-process materials changes from liquid milk to semi-solid gel after the addition of microorganism for a certain period of time (Grassi et al., 2013). It should be noted that the penetration depth of the light is also wavelength-dependent (Aernouts et al., 2011), therefore, the selection of an optimal measurement mode of a NIR analyser is mainly based on the physical and chemical properties of a target sample (i.e., sample thickness, liquid or powder, clear liquid or emulsion) and the instrument specifications (i.e., spectral range and resolution).

        <p>The spectra were collected using a FOSS-NIR 6500 system operating in the reflectance mode (FOSS UK Ltd., Warrington, UK). The spectral range is from 1100 nm to 2500 nm with a spectral interval of 2 nm. As observed in Fig. 5, the absorption bands in the NIR region are broad and overlapped. The water absorption bands due to the vibration of O-H bonds are found in the region of 1440-1470 nm and 1920-1940 nm (Manley, 2014). The protein absorption band at around 2172 nm can be attributed to the combination of C-O stretching, N-H bending and C-N stretching (Manley, 2014). The absorption band at 2274 nm is possibly due to C-H and O-H vibration from lactose (Holroyd, 2013).

        <p>An NIR spectrum generally consists of hundreds of wavelengths and the wavelengths are considered as variables. For example, there are 700 variables (wavelengths) in the NIR spectra of dairy powders as shown in Fig. 5. In addition, the spectra are very complicated due to the overlapping of the overtones and combination bands. Thus, multivariate data analysis (MDA) is required to extract meaningful information from the NIR spectra of the sample. Common spectroscopic data analytical approaches include spectral pre-processing, spectra exploration, regression (quantitative analysis) and classification (qualitative analysis), as summarised in Table 2. More details about multivariate data analysis and chemometrics in relation to spectroscopic data analysis can be referred to in papers by Rinnan, Berg, and Engelsen (2009), Roggo et al. (2007) and Xiaobo, Jiewen, Povey, Holmes, and Hanpin (2010).An NIR spectrum generally consists of hundreds of wavelengths and the wavelengths are considered as variables. For example, there are 700 variables (wavelengths) in the NIR spectra of dairy powders as shown in Fig. 5. In addition, the spectra are very complicated due to the overlapping of the overtones and combination bands. Thus, multivariate data analysis (MDA) is required to extract meaningful information from the NIR spectra of the sample. Common spectroscopic data analytical approaches include spectral pre-processing, spectra exploration, regression (quantitative analysis) and classification (qualitative analysis), as summarised in Table 2.

        <p>Before NIR spectroscopy can be employed in industry, a robust calibration model should be developed to ensure prediction results are accurate. A number of factors can influence the robustness of the model, i.e., the accuracy and reproducibility of the reference method, the sampling method used to collect representative samples, the spectra pre-processing methods, the quantitative or qualitative modelling methods.

        <p>Samples in the calibration set are used to develop the calibration model, an external set of samples are used to evaluate and validate the model performance. For quantitative modelling, the quality composition parameter (i.e., protein, moisture, fat and total solids) is the dependent variable Y (results obtained from the reference method), the spectral signal/intensity at each waveband is the independent variable X (X 1 , X 2 , …, X n ). For qualitative analysis (i.e., classification analysis), the sample class would be the dependent Once a robust calibration model is developed, it should be regularly validated and updated to ensure model prediction performance. A model that is developed on one NIR instrument might not be used directly in another similar NIR instrument due to variations in instrument components and the detecting environment. In this case, standardisation and calibration transfer techniques as mentioned in the review paper by Fearn (2001) can be applied to ensure model transferability for a wider model application.Samples in the calibration set are used to develop the calibration model, an external set of samples are used to evaluate and validate the model performance.

        <p>Currently, most of the NIR applications in the dairy industry are off-line or are at-line measurements. Moving NIR technology from a well-controlled measuring environment (samples are measured at static state and at a controlled temperature) to a more practical environment (samples are measured in flow conditions) can present many challenges, i.e., the effect of process conditions (e.g., temperature and flow) on the prediction performance and transferability of the calibration models. For example, the temperature of the samples and operating environment may vary during the production, which can influence the repeatability of the spectral signals collected, resulting in a reduction in the prediction accuracy of the calibration model. Therefore, it is essential to identify variables that might affect the spectra and these variables (i.e., temperature) must be considered when developing a calibration model.Currently, most of the NIR applications in the dairy industry are off-line or are at-line measurements.

        <p>Raw milk is the starting material of all dairy products. The changes in quality and composition of incoming milk can be due to seasonality, the animal feeding system used and stage of lactation, which can have a significant impact on the subsequent processes and products. As a result, continuous monitoring of incoming milk quality is required. Protein and fat are two nutritional components in liquid milk with high economic value. Bogomolov, Dietrich, Boldrini, and Kessler (2012) investigated the use of visible-NIR spectroscopy (TIDAS E, J&amp;M Analytik AG, Essingen, Germany, 400-1000 nm) to quantitatively analyse fat and total protein in bovine milk. Milk samples were prepared using cream (fat source), skim milk (protein source) and a 10%-solution of lactose and water. The samples had a protein content ranging from 2.6 to 3.2% and fat content ranging from 3.0% to 4.0%. PLS regression was conducted on the raw spectra, an excellent prediction performance (R 2 &gt; 0.94 and root mean square errors &lt; 0.05%) for the fat and protein content prediction was derived from the model, demonstrating the potential of NIR spectroscopy to be suitable for raw milk analysis either in the laboratory or in-line measurement.Raw milk is the starting material of all dairy products.

Lyndgaard, Engelsen, and van den Berg (2012) applied in-line NIR spectroscopy (Antaris MX FT-NIR Process Analyzer, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, 1000-2500 nm) for real-time measurement of the milk coagulation process. NIR spectra were collected during the coagulation process using a reflectance probe. PCA was applied to the spectral data to extract meaningful process information. Using component scores as a function of time, two kinetic models were developed, with one describing the whole coagulation process and the other describing three milk coagulation processes (k-casein proteolysis, micelle aggregation, and network formation). The models were successfully evaluated and validated using an additional 12 cheese batches to determine the cheese cutting-time. Nicolau, Buffa, O'Callaghan, Guamis, and Castillo (2015) used an in-line NIR light backscattering fibre optic sensor (CoAguLab, at 880nm, Reflectronics Inc., Lexington, KY, USA) to predict the clotting and cutting times during sheep cheese manufacture.

Svendsen, Cieplak, and van den Berg (2016) carried out seven milk fermentation batches at pilot scale using a 15 L in-house glass single-wall fermenter vessel.</p>
        <p>Batches 1-4 were maintained at nominal fermentation temperature of 35 °C, batch 5 was kept at 32 °C and batches 6-7 were conducted at 37.5 °C. A fibre optic reflectance probe (ABB Bomen, Quebec, Canada) was inserted in the fermentation broth for in-line and real-time acquisition of the NIR spectra (1000-1800 nm). The spectra were pre-processed by SNV to remove the scaling effect caused by sample differences, then modelled by PCA for each fermentation batch. In addition, an in-line pH meter was also placed in the fermentation broth for pH measurement, as it is currently used in the dairy industry for yoghurt fermentation monitoring. By comparing the pH profiles and the scores plot derived from the PCA modelling of the NIR data, it can be observed that NIR spectroscopy is preferable for process monitoring as it provides more information related to the physical (i.e., textural differences of gel formed)Batches 1-4 were maintained at nominal fermentation temperature of 35 °C, batch 5 was kept at 32 °C and batches 6-7 were conducted at 37.5 °C.

        <p>As reported in literature and from NIR companies' application notes, other applications of NIR spectroscopy in dairy processing include prediction of total solids, protein and the protein-total solids ratio after the final ultra-filtration process in whey protein concentrate (WPC) and milk protein concentrate (MPC) production (FOSS). In addition, an in-line NIR system (DA 7300, Perten Instruments, Stockholm, Sweden) was installed at the outlet of a butter churn for continuously measuring of moisture, butter-fat and colour during butter production. The real-time results could be used for quick adjustments of moisture content during butter production as well as for a complete documentation of the product quality (https://www.perten.com/Publications/Articles/DA-7300-In-line-NIR-for-butter-production).As reported in literature and from NIR companies' application notes, other applications of NIR spectroscopy in dairy processing include prediction of total solids, protein and the protein-total solids ratio after the final ultra-filtration process in whey protein concentrate (WPC) and milk protein concentrate (MPC) production (FOSS).

For a successful implementation of in-line NIR spectroscopy at an industrial level, the following challenges have to been addressed.</p>
        <p>(1) The NIR instruments need to be stable over a 10-year life time. They should also be able to cope with vibrations and variations in processing conditions (i.e., the temperature / humidity fluctuation of the process environment). Alternatively, the spectrometer can be placed in a protective cabinet with temperature control to reduce the effect of the process environment on the NIR signal.(1) The NIR instruments need to be stable over a 10-year life time.

        <p>(2) For those batch to batch type processes as mentioned in section 5. 3 and 5.4 (i.e., milk coagulation in cheese manufacturing, milk fermentation in yoghurt production), the cost of the individual NIR sensor should be taken into consideration, as a dairy processor may have many batches to be monitored at the same time. Alternatively, a multiplexed spectrometer which allows several process probes / sensors to be connected to the same spectrometer could be used for monitoring different batches.(2) For those batch to batch type processes as mentioned in section 5. 3 and 5.4 (i.e., milk coagulation in cheese manufacturing, milk fermentation in yoghurt production), the cost of the individual NIR sensor should be taken into consideration, as a dairy processor may have many batches to be monitored at the same time.

        <p>(3) For calibration development, the in-line sampling points must be as close to the sensor as possible.

        <p>Transferring calibration models between different on-line or in-line NIR instruments is also a challenge, as variations in instrument components (optics or new replacements) and detecting environment (temperature and humidity) may result in spectral differences between the same samples. Different standardisation techniques can be applied to adjust the calibration model by slope and bias correction, or to correct the spectra by spectral processing (i.e., SNV or MSC pretreatment) or standardisation (i.e., direct standardisation and piecewise direct standardization) (Fearn, 2001;Pu et al., 2017).Transferring calibration models between different on-line or in-line NIR instruments is also a challenge, as variations in instrument components (optics or new replacements) and detecting environment (temperature and humidity) may result in spectral differences between the same samples.

        <p>The higher demand for global consumption of dairy products requires dairy processors to increase process efficiency, product quality and yield. NIR spectroscopy has been seen as a fast, nondestructive and chemical-free process analytical technology for real-time measurement of a variety of dairy products, from liquid, semi-solid to solid samples. Successful implementation of NIR technology in the production lines can bring many benefits to the dairy industry by improving the knowledge and understanding of the process through real-time process monitoring. Additional personnel upskilling is required for development, evaluation and maintenance of robust calibration models at industrial level to ensure the performance of a NIR analytical solution. Also, future work on the connection and communication between the NIR measuring system and the control system are required to close the loop of 'process, monitoring and control', and thus to achieve the goal of quality-by-design by real-time and continuous process automation.The higher demand for global consumption of dairy products requires dairy processors to increase process efficiency, product quality and yield.
