        <p>Sample preparation is a critical step in the analysis of metals in environmental samples due to their low concentration and the complexity of sample matrix [1]. Liquid phase micro-extraction (LPME) of metals has gained increasing attention since introduced by Chamsaz in 2003 [2], as a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to classical liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) [3]. LPME has extensively been investigated in its three main modalities: single drop micro-extraction (SDME), dispersive liquidliquid micro-extraction (DLLME), and hollow fiber liquid phase micro-extraction (HFLPME) [4].Sample preparation is a critical step in the analysis of metals in environmental samples due to their low concentration and the complexity of sample matrix [1].

        <p>Ionic liquids (ILs) were incorporated to LPME by Liu et al., in 2005, as co-solvents in the organic solution, with the aim to enhance pre-concentration of metals [5]. ILs are organic salts formed by an organic cation and an organic or inorganic anion, which are liquid at a temperature lower than 100 C [6]. Those ILs liquid at working conditions are called room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) [7]. Their application in LPME is supported by their thermal stability, negligible vapor pressure, and high hydrophobicity. Based on these properties, they have been considered to be more environmentally friendly than conventional solvents [6].Ionic liquids (ILs) were incorporated to LPME by Liu et al., in 2005, as co-solvents in the organic solution, with the aim to enhance pre-concentration of metals [5].

        <p>Additionally, the structure of the cation and the anion in ILs can be finely tuned, adding functional groups for a specific task (TSILs) [8], and the estimated number of possible combination is bigger than 10 18 . Reported benefits of using ILs for LPME are a better selectivity and efficiency for metals preconcentration in shorter experimental times, together with a better environmental profile of the organic solution [9]. Despite they have been considered to be greener than molecular solvents due to their low vapor pressure, some ILs present toxicity for aquatic organisms [10]. This aspect must be considered in the selection and design of structures for development of new ILs with application in LPME. In order to overcome this drawback, deep eutectic solvents (DES) have also been tested in the LPME of metals, showing better stability during extraction, more accessible sources to precursors, lower cost, and lower toxicity than ILs [1,11]. DES were discovered by Abbot et al., in 2003, and they are the result of combining various hydrogen bond acceptors and hydrogen bond donors [11,12]. They have been considered by some authors as a sub-class of ILS, due to their similar characteristics and properties [13]. However, they can be considered as different category than ILs due to some unique properties as solvents [11].Additionally, the structure of the cation and the anion in ILs can be finely tuned, adding functional groups for a specific task (TSILs) [8], and the estimated number of possible combination is bigger than 10 18 .

        <p>Despite recent reviews on the application of ILs to LPME have been published, specific discussion on their application to metals determination has not been carried out since Stanisz et al. (2014) [14]. However, more than 50% of works about IL-LPME of metals for Environmental Analytical Chemistry have been published in the period 2015e2020, including the rising development of some subclasses of ILS as TSILs, or magnetic ILs among others, as well as DES.Despite recent reviews on the application of ILs to LPME have been published, specific discussion on their application to metals determination has not been carried out since Stanisz et al.

        <p>ILs are composed of an organic cation and an anion that can be either organic or inorganic. Cations are based on imidazolium, phosphonium, ammonium, pyrrolidinium and pyridinium; while the common anions are hexafluorophosphate, tetrafluoroborate, halides, alkylsulfates, alkylsulfonate, trifluoromethylsulfonate and bis[(trifluoro-methyl)sulfonyl]amide [15] (Fig. 1). Due to its hydrophobicity, PF 6ILs are composed of an organic cation and an anion that can be either organic or inorganic.

Due to its hydrophobicity, PF 6</p>
        <p>À has been the most frequently used anion; however it is highly toxic and leads to the formation of hydrofluoric acid in the presence of moisture, resulting in damage of glassware and steel parts [16]. ILs with this composition have been mainly used as co-solvents, partially substituting a molecular solvent in the organic solutions with good results, but they have been less used in last years. Hexylmethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C 6 mim][PF 6 ]) has been applied as solvent for complexing agents as ammonium pyrrolidine dithicarbamate (APDC), di-ethyl-di-thiocarbamate (DDTC), and 2-(6-methylbenzothiazolylazo)-6-nitrophenol [17e19]. Butylmethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C 4 mim][PF 6 ]) has been applied as a co-solvent of ethanol, using DDTC as complexing agent, and also as a solvent for dilution of L-cysteine [20e22].À has been the most frequently used anion; however it is highly toxic and leads to the formation of hydrofluoric acid in the presence of moisture, resulting in damage of glassware and steel parts [16].

        <p>However, in the last years the use of ILs not only as co-solvents, but also as extractants has gained relevance. In this regard, ILs can be classified in two groups depending on the characteristics of the anion. First, commercially available ILs as trioctylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquat ® 336) [23,24], and trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium chloride (Cyphos® IL 101) [25]. Second, these ILs have served as precursors for the targeted synthesis of new ILs for LPME, resulting in task specific ionic liquids (TSILs) [8], in which Cl À is substituted by an organic anion through metathesis reaction [24]. The use of TSILs has expanded the possibilities of ILs in LPME, because their structure can be predefined to improve extraction efficiency or selectivity in metal extraction.However, in the last years the use of ILs not only as co-solvents, but also as extractants has gained relevance.

        <p>In most of cases the organic anion of TSILs is based on an carboxylic acid containing other electron donor atoms, which improve the complexation capability of the IL [6]. These TSILs present irregular behavior at different sample pH due to their zwitterionic nature, and they have showed to be particularly efficient at basic pH (8e10) and highly saline waters [26]. TSILs applied in LPME of metals are shown in Fig. 2.In most of cases the organic anion of TSILs is based on an carboxylic acid containing other electron donor atoms, which improve the complexation capability of the IL [6].

        <p>In order to elucidate the influence of the ILs structure on the extraction capability, TSILs with a common anion have been applied in combination with different cations, mainly changing the length of the linear alkyl group or the central atom [27]. Normally, the cation is considered to control physical properties of the liquid [28]. However, Pirkwieser et In spite of the potential and applicability of ILs in LPME, there are still some aspects to be improved, mainly derived from their partial dissolution in the sample during extraction [30]. In the last years, the use of deep eutectic solvents (DES) has arisen to overcome this limitation (Fig. 3), improving their properties and environmental profile [1]. They were incorporated in the LPME of metals in 2016 [35,36]. Since then, they have been applied as solvent media for the microextraction of metals in different environmental samples. The first DES used in LPME of metals was the result of a combination of choline chloride and urea, which was applied as a solvent for magnetic nanoparticles and APDC, in the microextraction of Pb and Cd [35,36]. Phosphonium based ILs as benzyl triphenyl phosphonium bromide and Cyphos® 101 have been used as precursors of DES [37,38]. In combination with salicylate, these DESs act simultaneously as solvents and extractants [38]. This strategy has been also followed combining tetrabutyl ammonium bromide ((TBAB)eH 2 Oe (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ) and ammonium sulphate, or thiomalic acid and ferric chloride [26,39]. Finally, DESs containing metallic cations as Zn(II) in their structure have been prepared for micro-extraction of V(V) and Cd(II), combining ZnCl 2 with acetamide to dissolve APDC as complexing agent in the presence of Triton X 114 as a dispersing agent [40].In order to elucidate the influence of the ILs structure on the extraction capability, TSILs with a common anion have been applied in combination with different cations, mainly changing the length of the linear alkyl group or the central atom [27].

        <p>Regarding extraction mechanism of metals in IL-LPME, limited information is available [41]; however, two main mechanisms have been proposed: ionic exchange and ion association. In the first mechanism, metallic anionic species in solution are exchanged by the anion in the IL, as it happens with Ag, Cd, Hg and Pd in saline samples [42], where they appear as the corresponding negatively charged chlorocomplexes. This mechanism prevails when Cl À , PF 6 À , or Br À are used as anions, leading to the loss of ILs into the sample during extraction [41].

        <p>À , which is among the most commonly used anions in IL-LPME, but it presents some concerns related with the release of hydrofluoric acid into the samples in slightly acidic media. In ion association, the functional groups of the anion present ability to complex the free ion of metals [6], improving the efficiency and the selectivity of extraction, as well as reducing the loss of IL into the sample [30]. The development of TSILs based on organic anions favors the metallic complexation mechanisms. Despite both mechanisms can be observed when inorganic and organic anions are used, they are highly dependent on the speciation of the metal. In summary, the application of ILs in LPME of metals in environmental samples has experienced a great evolution in a short period. They were first applied as co-solvents to improve the characteristics of the organic solution, and they have evolved to play the double role of solvent and extractant, thanks to the discovery of new substances as TSILs, MILs and DESs.À , which is among the most commonly used anions in IL-LPME, but it presents some concerns related with the release of hydrofluoric acid into the samples in slightly acidic media.

        <p>ILs have been applied in the three main modalities of LPME for metals: single drop liquid phase micro-extraction (SDME), dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction (DLLME), and hollow fiber liquid phase micro-extraction (HFLPME); while DESs have been applied only in DLLME [1]. Different methods based on IL and DES-LPME have been developed to pre-concentrate metals from environmental samples, mainly natural waters (freshwater, seawater, saltwork) and sediment. These applications have focused both on total concentrations of metals and speciation studies, as described below.ILs have been applied in the three main modalities of LPME for metals: single drop liquid phase micro-extraction (SDME), dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction (DLLME), and hollow fiber liquid phase micro-extraction (HFLPME); while DESs have been applied only in DLLME [1].

        <p>The first configuration in which ILs were applied to liquid phase micro-extraction was SDME [5]. In SDME a drop of extracting solvent is suspended from a syringe into the aqueous sample containing the analyte. After extraction, the organic drop is retracted back into the microsyringe and injected into the detector for quantification of the analytes [9]. The droplet can be either disposed to the headspace or directly immersed in the sample, distinguishing two main SDME modalities: headspace SDME (HS-SDME) or direct immersion SDME (D-SDME) (Fig. 4a) [9]. The main advantage of using IL in SDME is an enhancement of stability of the drop during extraction.The first configuration in which ILs were applied to liquid phase micro-extraction was SDME [5].

        <p>. Cations [C 4 mim] and [C 6 mim] have been the most commonly used in this methodology due to a balance between hydrophobicity and viscosity, allowing enough stability of the organic solution without reducing diffusion of the extracted metal [5]. This methodology has been applied to the micro-extraction of Ag, Cu, Hg, Co and Pb in tap and lake water, and human hair and serum [43,44]..

        <p>Despite, it was the first developed IL-LPME, IL-SDME has had limited interest due to shortcomings related with lower efficiency than DLLME and HFLPME. In fact, new applications of IL-SDME for metals have not been found since the technique was revised by Marcinkowski et al., in 2015 [45].Despite, it was the first developed IL-LPME, IL-SDME has had limited interest due to shortcomings related with lower efficiency than DLLME and HFLPME.

        <p>DLLME of metals is based on the dispersion of micro-droplets of an organic solution containing the extractant into a sample containing the target metal [9]. This LPME mode uses a ternary solvent system, in which a dispersing solvent is added to the sample to keep the micro-droplets of extractant solution dispersed in the sample, which is placed into a conical tube. Then, a cloudy solution is formed, favoring a fast mass transfer of the analytes to the receiving solution. Centrifugating, the extraction solvent containing the analyte is separated from the sample and then, removed from the tube with a syringe for instrumental determination of the metal (Fig. 4b) [3]. Applications of IL-DLLME can be can be found in Table 1. In comparison with other IL-LPME, IL-DLLME requires shorter extraction times, as it happens when conventional solvents are applied. Sample amount required in this technique ranges from 2 mL to 20 mL, while the amount of IL applied is in the range 30e2000 mL.DLLME of metals is based on the dispersion of micro-droplets of an organic solution containing the extractant into a sample containing the target metal [9].

        <p>Although extensively applied, DLLME suffers from some limitations that need to be overcome, as the use of harmful chlorinated solvents like chloroform, chlorobenzene and carbon tetrachloride to stabilize the dispersion [46]. The use of a dispersant is particularly important in IL-DLLME due to the high viscosity of ILs [47]. According to green solvents assessment, acetone has been the primary choice in IL-DLLME followed by methanol, ethanol, and in less extent acetonitrile. Also surfactants as Triton X-114, Triton X-100 and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), have been applied as dispersants when highly viscous ILs are used in the extraction of saline samples [3]. In this sense, the development of new TSILs has allowed the development of dispersantless DLLME, in which the IL can also substitute the use of the dispersant [41].Although extensively applied, DLLME suffers from some limitations that need to be overcome, as the use of harmful chlorinated solvents like chloroform, chlorobenzene and carbon tetrachloride to stabilize the dispersion [46].

        <p>More attention has been paid to ILs acting as carriers, as Ali-quat® 336 for the extraction of Au from several water matrices, including mining waters [51]. Additionally, TSILs that incorporate organic anions as methyltrioctylammonium thiosalicylate ([N 1888 ] [TS]) for Co and Cd detection were applied [52,53]. ILs formed by combination of salicylate and the cations [HOC 2 OC 2 mim] and [HOC 3 mim] have been useful for Cu and Cd DLLME [31]. In the case of Cu extraction from blood and serum, the TSIL cetyl pyridinium naphthenate was applied in cloud-point DLLME, using the surfactant Triton X to facilitate the dispersion of IL in the sample, increasing the contact between IL and Cu [54].More attention has been paid to ILs acting as carriers, as Ali-quat® 336 for the extraction of Au from several water matrices, including mining waters [51].

        <p>A rising field of research in DLLME is the application of deep eutectic solvents, which reduce the use of a dispersant and limit the loss of IL into the sample during extraction. The first DES used in DLLME was choline chloride-urea (ChCl-urea), which was applied for dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the microextraction of Pb and Cd from river and seawater, as well as from the digested solutions of soil and hair samples [35]. APDC has been incorporated in DES solutions based on ZnCl 2 -acetamide to extract Cd and V from different types of waters as mining and wastewater [36,40]. The most recent development in DES-DLLME is the use of DES simultaneously as solvents and ligands. For instance tetrabutyl ammonium bromide-ammonium sulphate has been applied in the multi-elemental analysis of Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, and Zn from several environmental water matrices, and thiomalic-ferric chloride has been used in the determination of Cr in water samples [26,39].A rising field of research in DLLME is the application of deep eutectic solvents, which reduce the use of a dispersant and limit the loss of IL into the sample during extraction.

The most recent development in DES-DLLME is the use of DES simultaneously as solvents and ligands. For instance tetrabutyl ammonium bromide-ammonium sulphate has been applied in the multi-elemental analysis of Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, and Zn from several environmental water matrices, and thiomalic-ferric chloride has been used in the determination of Cr in water samples [26,39].</p>
        <p>Due to their chemical versatility, thermal stability and high viscosity ILs have been incorporated to in-situ, temperaturecontrolled or ultrasound assisted DLLME. Undoubtedly, ultrasound assisted DLLME (USA-DLLME) has appeared as a rising field of development in IL-LPME. It consists in the application of ultrasound energy to substitute the use of a dispersant, promoting the formation of micro-droplets of the extractant solution, improving the contact between the sample and the organic solution in times even shorter than 1 s [38]. [C 6 mim][PF 6 ] has been used as a medium with APDC and 2-(6-methylbenzothiazolylazo)-6-nitrophenol for the extraction of Cd and Pb from water samples and biological fluids [18,21,55,56]. Playing the double role of solvent and extractant, phosphonium based ILs Cyphos® 101 and Cyphos® 104 have been applied to the pre-concentration of Pb from human fluids [57], while ammonium based Aliquat® 336 has been used for extraction of Te, Cr, and Cd from several water matrices [47,58]. Also DES have been incorporated to USA-DLLME of Pb, Cd, Co, and Ni from drinking and environmental waters to favor the dispersion of DES, as it is the case of trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium chloridethiosalicylic acid [38].Due to their chemical versatility, thermal stability and high viscosity ILs have been incorporated to in-situ, temperaturecontrolled or ultrasound assisted DLLME.

        <p>In the case of in-situ IL-DLLME, a hydrophilic precursor of the IL is added to the sample to complex the metal and then, an ionic exchanger is added to the sample leading to the metathesis reaction to form the hydrophobic IL, which can be separated from the sample. This methodology was introduced in 2009 by Baghdadi et al. for Hg micro-extraction [59]. In the last year is has gotten renewed attention for pre-concentration of metals. DDTC was added as hydrophilic ligand for Ni, Zn and Cu in wastewaters, and later [C 4 mim][PF 6 ] was incorporated as ion exchanger [20]. Vidal et al. used the same strategy for Cr speciation using [C 6 mim][PF 6 ] as ion exchanger and changing sample pH [17]. This way, they could extract Cr (VI) pH 2, and total Cr at pH 5. Finally, micro-extraction of Cd and Pb from groundwaters has been carried out using L-cysteine as complexing agent and [C 4 mim][PF 6 ] as IL in vortex-assisted DLLME [21]. A main advantage of this methodology is that dispersant agents are rarely needed [60].In the case of in-situ IL-DLLME, a hydrophilic precursor of the IL is added to the sample to complex the metal and then, an ionic exchanger is added to the sample leading to the metathesis reaction to form the hydrophobic IL, which can be separated from the sample.

        <p>To improve the mass transfer of the metal between the sample and the organic phase, air assisted DLLME (AA-DLLME) of Cu was introduced by Du et al. minimizing the need of dispersant in a system composed of [C 6 mim][PF 6 ] and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, in the presence of Triton 100 X as emulsifier [19]. Similarly effervescenceassisted DLLME (EA-DLLME) using a ChlCl-phenol DES as extraction medium for Cu by 1,5-diphenyl carbazide has been reported [37]. These methodologies are simpler than USA-DLLME, and in the case of EA-DLLME, external sample agitation is avoided, facilitating the portability of the microextraction systems.To improve the mass transfer of the metal between the sample and the organic phase, air assisted DLLME (AA-DLLME) of Cu was introduced by Du et al. minimizing the need of dispersant in a system composed of [C 6 mim][PF 6 ] and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, in the presence of Triton 100 X as emulsifier [19].

        <p>Temperature-controlled DLLME (TC-DLLME) in which the IL is formed in the sample at a temperature of approximately 80 C [61], has showed to be effective in the pre-concentration of Hg(II) from tap, pond and wastewater with ILs N-octylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate ([OPy][BF 4 ]) and N-octylpyridinium trifluoromethylsulfonate ([OPy] [TfO]) [61,62].

        <p>Magnetic nanoparticles of Fe 2 O 3 were incorporated to the ILs applied in DLLME by Soylak and Yilmaz (2015), to avoid the need of centrifugation of the metal enriched IL and the sample [63]. Magnetic nanoparticles allowed the separation APDC after extraction of Cd using a magnet, simplifying DLLME. This idea has evolved to the recent application of magnetic ionic liquids to the extraction of metals, described in section 2. MIL trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium tetrachloromanganate ([P 66614 ][MnCl 4 ]) has been applied in the pre-concentration of Pb from organic matrices as bee products i.e.: honey, vinegar or beer [64]. FeCl 4 À has been used as anion in poly (ethylene glycol) bis (methylimidazolium) 2FeCl 4 À for the microextraction of K from oil [34], and for speciation of As(V) and As(III). In the last case, a TSIL trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium hexachlorodisprosiate was applied to extract As(III) and total As was extracted using trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium FeCl 4 [33]. This strategy was also used for speciation of Sb(III)/Sb(V), using ammonium diethyldithiophosphate for selective extraction of Sb(III) [32].Magnetic nanoparticles of Fe 2 O 3 were incorporated to the ILs applied in DLLME by Soylak and Yilmaz (2015), to avoid the need of centrifugation of the metal enriched IL and the sample [63].

        <p>Finally, an approach to automation of IL-DLLME of metals has been recently proposed by Hui et al. (2019), based on the use of a centrifugal microfluidic disk to enrich and detect Hg in water samples [65]. In this case, IL and the sample are separated, after extraction, by means of centrifugal forces of the spinning disk and capillary valves, that allow separating the supernatant. Automation can be consider as one of the challenges for IL-DLLME that can lead also to the development of portable sampling devices based on the use of ILs.Finally, an approach to automation of IL-DLLME of metals has been recently proposed by Hui et al.

        <p>In hollow fiber liquid phase micro-extraction (HFLPME), analytes are transported from the sample to an acceptor phase placed inside the lumen of the hollow fiber, through an organic solution immobilized in the pores of the fiber walls [6] (Fig. 4c). HFLPME can be used in a two-phase (2-HFLPME) mode when the acceptor solution in the lumen is the same organic solution in the fiber pores, or in a three-phase mode (3-HFLPME), in which the organic solution impregnates the pores, separating an aqueous acceptor phase from the sample, acting as a liquid membrane (Fig. 4c) [66]. Common HFLPME setups are: U-shape, dynamic, and solvent bar microextraction (SBME). Among them, SBME has gotten increasing interest in IL-HFLPME due to its simplicity, as the fiber ends are sealed and the solvent bar can be left freely tumbling in the sample [67]. Table 2, summarizes the application of IL-HFLPME to the microextraction of metals. While extraction times are longer than for IL-DLLME, several experiments can be carried out simultaneously, without intervention of the analyst. The amount of ionic liquid as acceptor phase in 2-HFLPME is between 70 mg and 220 mg, while in the case of 3-HFLPME has not been defined, but it is smaller, as it is exclusively impregnating the pores of the fiber wall.

        <p>As for the rest of LPME techniques, the first use of ILs in HFLPME was the partial substitution of the molecular solvent by imidazolium based ILs, mainly [C n mim][PF 6 ], to improve metal extraction by a ligand [3,6]. However, in the reviewed period the trend has been the application of commercial and synthesized TSILs, which can act as solvents as well as extractants. One of the advantages of using a HF to support the IL, is that it offers a better control of partial dissolution of the IL into the sample during extraction [29]. In fact, this phenomenon, so-called "leaching" is generalized for IL-LPME, and should be taken into account when deciding the type of IL, the LPME modality, and during optimization of the microextraction [6].As for the rest of LPME techniques, the first use of ILs in HFLPME was the partial substitution of the molecular solvent by imidazolium based ILs, mainly [C n mim][PF 6 ], to improve metal extraction by a ligand [3,6].

        <p>The commercial IL Aliquat® 336 has been applied in HFLPME of Ag ultra-traces in seawater samples, using a 2 phases mode, showing the capacity of ILs for the extraction of metals in the presence of a highly saline matrix, that limits the applicability of most of conventional ligands [24]. For this metal, Cyphos® 101 has showed to be selective for the extraction of AgCl n (nÀ1)-complexes at the natural pH of seawater [25]. This way, the speciation of silver associated to dissolved organic matter could be estimated. This IL has been useful also for the micro-extraction of priority and emerging pollutants as Cd, and Pd from saline and hypersaline waters [42]. The success of Aliquat® 336 and Cyphos® 101 for micro-extraction of metals, forming chloro-complexes in marine waters, is based on its capacity to exchange the Cl À of the IL by the negatively charged chlorocomplexes of Ag and Cd from the sample [68].The commercial IL Aliquat® 336 has been applied in HFLPME of Ag ultra-traces in seawater samples, using a 2 phases mode, showing the capacity of ILs for the extraction of metals in the presence of a highly saline matrix, that limits the applicability of most of conventional ligands [24].

        <p>The main development in IL-HFLPME has been the implementation of tailored ILs based on ammonium and phosphonium precursors, substituting the inorganic anion by an organic one. Derivatives of Aliquat® 336 in which Cl À has been substituted by methyl thiobenzoate ([MTBA]) or thyosalicylate ([TS]) have showed to be effective in the HFLPME of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb from tap and river water samples. Additionally, trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium anthranilate ([P 66614 ][Ant]) and trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium salicylate ([P 66614 ][Sal]) have been applied to Ag and Pt microextraction in the same matrices [29].The main development in IL-HFLPME has been the implementation of tailored ILs based on ammonium and phosphonium precursors, substituting the inorganic anion by an organic one.

        <p>Some new TSILs have been proposed specifically for the HFLPME of metals from saline and hypersaline samples, including saltworks. Pb, Cu, Cd, and Ag were selectively extracted with ILs based on 3hydroxy-2-naphtoate anion. In this case, ILs containing methyltrioctylphosphonium and methyltrioctylammonium cations showed to be sensitive to the saline matrix, offering poor results in seawater, while trihexyltetradecylphosphonium based IL kept the same efficiency as in non-saline samples [27]. Recently, methyltrioctilphosphonium hexylsulfanyl acetate ([P 1888 ][C 6 SAc]) and methyltrioctylammonium hexylsulfanyl acetate ([N 1888 ][C 6 SAc]) have been used for the selective microextraction of Ag, Ni, Cd, Cu and Zn species in the form of chloro-complexes from saltworks [30].Some new TSILs have been proposed specifically for the HFLPME of metals from saline and hypersaline samples, including saltworks.

        <p>In general, for IL-HFLPME the use of 2 phases configuration is preferred over 3-HFLPME, because ILs present high affinity for metallic species; and the release of metal from the organic solution to the acceptor phase is limited.In general, for IL-HFLPME the use of 2 phases configuration is preferred over 3-HFLPME, because ILs present high affinity for metallic species; and the release of metal from the organic solution to the acceptor phase is limited.</p>
        <p>Several instrumental techniques have been applied for metal determination after pre-concentration by IL-LPME. Selection of the instrumental technique is driven by the nature of the acceptor solution. In the case of two phases systems, it is an ionic liquid solution, and some adaptions have to be made in the instrumental technique for metal quantification.Several instrumental techniques have been applied for metal determination after pre-concentration by IL-LPME.

        <p>Atomic absorption is the most frequent option, with flame (FAAS) and with electro-thermal (ETAAS) atomization. In the case of FAAS, the volume of sample required is sometimes bigger than the IL used in microextraction. In this particular case the IL solution is diluted in an organic solvent as ethanol, methanol, or acetonitrile, reducing the viscosity of the sample and easing its injection [20,58]. To avoid dilution of the metal enriched IL solution, Yan et al. have proposed the use of micro-injection of the sample in thermospray flame furnace [69]. Using ETAAS, adaption of atomization programs can be enough in some cases [24]; however, molecular solvents can be added also in this case to reduce sample viscosity and to minimized background signal, or potential loss of the analyte together with IL during pyrolysis step prior atomization [57]. The strategy of diluting the IL phase prior injection has been extended to other instrumental techniques, as tungsten coil atomic emission spectrometry for Cr detection [17], or HPLC-UV determination of Pb, Cd, Co and Ni after extraction in DES trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium chloride and thiosalicylic acid [38]. In both cases acetonitrile was used as a diluent.Atomic absorption is the most frequent option, with flame (FAAS) and with electro-thermal (ETAAS) atomization.
