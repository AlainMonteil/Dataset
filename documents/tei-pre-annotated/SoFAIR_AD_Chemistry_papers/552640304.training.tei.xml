        <p>The concentrations of U in natural waters are usually low, being typically less than 4 μg/L in river water, around 3.3 μg/L in open seawater, and usually less than 5 μg/L in groundwater. Higher concentrations can occur in both surface water and groundwater and the range spans some six orders of magnitude, with extremes in the mg/L range. However, such extremes in surface water are rare and linked to localized mineralization or evaporation in alkaline lakes. High concentrations in groundwater, substantially above the WHO provisional guideline value for U in drinking water of 30 μg/L, are associated most strongly with (i) granitic and felsic volcanic aquifers, (ii) continental sandstone aquifers especially in alluvial plains and (iii) areas of U mineralization. High-U groundwater provinces are more common in arid and semi-arid terrains where evaporation is an additional factor involved in concentrating U and other solutes. Examples of granitic and felsic volcanic terrains with documented high U concentrations include several parts of peninsular India, eastern USA,</p>
        <p>Uranium is the 49th most abundant element in the earth's crust with a similar abundance to beryllium, tin and arsenic. It is relatively abundant in seawater: ranking 26th, similar to that of arsenic and vanadium. It is a very dense metal (19.1 kg/m 3 ), similar to gold, and has the greatest atomic number (92) of all the naturally-occurring elements in the periodic table.</p>
        <p>Uranium is lithophile, reflecting its tendency to remain close to the earth's surface and be strongly bound to oxygen. It occurs naturally in all soils, minerals, rocks and water. It can also be derived from a wide variety of anthropogenic sources including phosphate fertilizers, mine waste, fly ash from power plants, and military use. Uranium occurs in oxidation states III, IV, V and VI but the dominant forms in nature are IV and VI. Uranium is an actinide element with three naturally-occurring isotopes, all weakly radioactive. Isotopic mass is dominated by 238 U (99.27%), with a smaller abundance of 235 U (0.72%) and 234 U (0.0057%); radioactivity contributions of 238 U, 235 U and 234 U are 47.3%, 2.2% and 50.5% respectively. Uranium is one of the main contributors to the earth's natural radioactivity which supplies about half of the earth's heat. In refined forms, it has been used to make nuclear weapons and supply nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>Human exposure to environmental uranium has long been considered a radiological health risk, although there are few epidemiological studies that have been able to demonstrate resultant harm, even in occupational contexts (The Royal Society, 2001, 2002;van Gerwen et al., 2020). There has been increasing concern that the chemical effects of uranium also pose a health risk to exposed populations as with other trace metals. Drinking water is considered to account for about 70% of the U uptake in a standard human diet (Haneklaus et al., 2021). Impacts of chemical exposure include nephritis (kidney disease) and changes in bone structure (Arzuaga et al., 2010;Brugge and Buchner, 2011;Kurttio et al., 2002Kurttio et al., , 2005;;Milvey and Cothern, 1990;Weir, 2004). Ingested uranium is considered less toxic than inhaled uranium, in part due to a relatively low gastrointestinal absorption of uranium compounds (Keith et al., 2013); average uptake of ingested U is said to be only about 1% (Zamora et al., 1998). In blood plasma, uranyl forms a U-CO 3 complex in equilibrium with a non-diffusible uranyl albumin complex which is excreted under alkaline conditions. Complexes with other proteins such as transferrin, ferritin and metallothionein may also be of importance (Michon et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>Toxic effects of U have been found in animal species, including death at high exposures. Limited evidence in animal studies suggests that aqueous speciation plays a role in toxicity, with U-Ca-CO 3 complexes inferred to have reduced toxicity or bioavailability relative to other Cafree species (Ansoborlo et al., 2006). So far, evidence of chemical toxicity in humans is limited (Kurttio et al., 2006(Kurttio et al., , 2002;;Staines et al., 2004;WHO, 2017) and restricted to sub-clinical effects (Kurttio et al., 2005;Seldén et al., 2009;Zamora et al., 1998); evidence for the impact of U aqueous speciation on toxicity in humans is also lacking. There is no evidence that U is essential to humans.</p>
        <p>Globally, a wide variation is seen in the limits and guidelines imposed for U in drinking water, from 2 μg/L in Japan to 1700 μg/L in Russia (Sahoo et al., 2020). The WHO (1993) guidelines for drinking-water quality recognized U as a potential chemical hazard but concluded that insufficient data were available at the time to derive a realistic guideline value. Subsequent editions of the guidelines produced provisional guideline values which have been revised following increasing toxicological evidence. The fourth edition, incorporating the first addendum (WHO, 2017) has recommended a provisional guideline value of 30 μg/L. Both the EU Directive for U in water intended for human consumption and the US-EPA maximum contaminant level (MCL) for U in drinking water are also currently set at 30 μg/L, although the EU Directive has only been in place since 2021 (Council of the European Union, 2020) with two years for Member States to transpose to national legislation. The drinking-water standard for U in Canada is μg/L; that set nationally in Germany is 10 μg/L (Banning and Benfer, 2017). These guidelines/limits are based on the chemical toxicity rather than radiological hazard. The EU, US-EPA and WHO limits for U of μg/L equate to an activity of approximately 0.78 Bq/L, assuming natural U abundance. Calculations of radiological dose from drinking water using dose conversion factors for U indicate that the 0.1 mSv/yr individual dose criterion of WHO (2017) would only be breached at a U concentration of 100 μg/L or more. The WHO (2017) guideline values for radioactivity from 234 U and 238 U in drinking water are 1 Bq/L and Bq/L respectively. In addition, the EU limits on radioactivity in water intended for human consumption are set at 2.8 Bq/L and 3.0 Bq/L for 234 U and 238 U respectively (Council of the European Union, 2013). Assuming natural abundances, these latter equate to concentrations of approximately 212 μg/L for 234 U and 243 μg/L for 238 U, although it should be noted that for a concentration of 243 μg/L at natural abundance, the limit for 234 U will already have been exceeded since 234 U is much more radioactive than 238 U. Also, since the limits are set for isotopes individually, the aggregate activity of a concentration at natural abundance will be approximately twice as high because of the combined contributions of the isotopes. The WHO, EU and US-EPA guidelines/limits are therefore more stringent for chemical toxicity than for radiological hazard.</p>
        <p>Measurements of gross alpha activity in water give an indication of the presence of alpha emitters including 238 U and 234 U. The WHO (2017) radiological screening level for gross alpha activity in drinking water of 0.5 Bq/L would be equivalent to a U concentration of approximately μg/L, assuming activity is due only to U and that 238 U and 234 U are in secular equilibrium, with an aggregate activity of 0.0261 Bq/μg of U. Gross alpha activity is a screening method to prompt further investigation.</p>
        <p>In many countries the regulations and guidelines for U in drinking water are relatively new (e.g. EU Directive) and where this is the case, there has commonly not been a history of widespread U measurement or monitoring. This paper highlights locations with known high concentrations in water, and also reveals the large data gaps in many countries. We also review the principal processes controlling the fate of U in the natural environment, and how these can be quantified: a prerequisite for understanding risks to drinking water and establishing the safety case for the long-term safe storage of radioactive waste. A vast literature exists on the topic of U in water and the environment; this review does not claim to have been able to cover all of it. It does however, outline the spatial distributions of the documented high concentrations in water and attempts to capture and summarize their key controls and impacts.</p>
        <p>A wide variety of techniques has been developed to measure the concentration of dissolved U in natural waters and laboratory solutions, including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), fluorimetry, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), fission track, instrumental neutron activation, spectrophotometry, graphite furnace AAS, voltammetry, alpha spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy (Table 1).</p>
        <p>ICP-MS is arguably the most commonly used method today though laser fluorimetry is also widely used. Quadrupole ICP-MS offers rapid throughput, high precision and accuracy and low detection limits with a technique that can routinely analyze multiple elements across the mass range from Li to U. Use of a collision or reaction cell has been introduced to reduce spectral interferences. Developments in magnetic sector ICP-MS have also allowed greater discrimination of the elements via their mass/charge ratio to eliminate interferences suffered by quadrupole ICP-MS and provide improved detection limits, e.g. better than 10 -4 μg/ L for U (Z. Cheng et al., 2004). Laser fluorimetry is also rapid, sensitive and well-established. This involves excitation of uranyl by electromagnetic energy of suitable wavelengths and measurement of the decay in U phosphorescence following the cessation of the electromagnetic radiation usually in the presence of a fluorescence-enhancing reagent (Balaram et al., 2022). Ganesh et al. (2012) used the method with sodium pyrophosphate as the fluorescence-enhancing reagent and determined U in solutions with a detection limit of 0.2 μg/L. Light emitting diode (LED) fluorimetry is a variant of the method that offers reduced interferences and is field-portable (Balaram et al., 2022). Reduction of interference from fluorescence of organic compounds and hence improved sensitivity can be achieved by use of time-resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS), with complexation of U(VI) usually with phosphoric acid (Moulin et al., 1990).</p>
        <p>ICP-OES is a rapid, multi-element technique but with a detection limit for U typically around 20 μg/L, is normally insufficiently sensitive for routine analysis in natural waters without preconcentration. However, Singhal et al. (2012) analyzed U in water samples using ICP-OES without preconcentration by minimizing spectral interferences through optimization of chosen emission lines, and reported concentrations down to 8 μg/L. Li et al. (2021) also optimized spectral lines to improve detection of U in minerals. Chandrasekaran et al. (2011) used a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction method for analysis of aqueous samples by ICP-OES and reported a detection limit of 2 μg/L. Stucker et al. (2011) devised a method for evaluating U flux in groundwater at a U contaminated site over a 3-week field experiment using anion-exchange resins to adsorb U. Uranium was extracted using 1% nitric acid and measured by ICP-MS. Calculated flux-averaged U concentrations compared well with measured aqueous concentrations.</p>
        <p>Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS) has also been used for U analysis. This offers greater sensitivity than flame AAS and sensitivity has been improved further by resin preconcentration (Gupta et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>Raman spectroscopy is typically used as a rapid screening technique and is field-portable (Ruan et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>Fission track analysis of water samples has been carried out by irradiation of sample and standard in contact with a fission track detector and comparing track densities (Akram et al., 2004).</p>
        <p>An increasing effort has been focused on developing sensors and probes for U detection based on its optical (colorimetry, spectrophotometry, fluorimetry) and electrochemical (voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potentiometry) properties as well as the use of DNAzymes (Liu et al., 2007;Sun et al., 2022;X. Wu et al., 2019;Zhou et al., 2022). A membrane optical sensor (optode) formed by incorporation of a chromophore (2-(2-benzothiazolylazo)phenol (BTAP)) and uranyl into a plasticized cellulose triacetate matrix was used by Hassan and Amin (2017) for preconcentration and colorimetric determination of U(VI) in aqueous samples. A detection limit of 0.8 μg/L was achieved by the method. Serenjeh et al. (2016) measured uranyl in aqueous samples through its complexation by the chemical immobilization of arsenazo III on a transparent agarose membrane and determination by spectrophotometry. Byerley et al. (1987) separated U(VI) Korkisch and Gödl (1974), Boulyga and Becker (2002), Avivar et al. (2012), Qiao et al. (2018), Qiao and Xu (2018) by ion exchange and reacted with 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol with measurement by ion chromatography. Elhefnawy (2017) determined U (VI) in acid medium by complexation with midodrine hydrochloride and detection by spectrophotometry. The challenge is to achieve the required sensitivity, selectivity, ease of operation and cost. An azo ligand, selected on the basis of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and immobilized on a test strip shows promise in detecting U with nanomolar sensitivity and freedom from interference (Wu et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>For the measurement of isotopic ratios, thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) has good precision and accuracy and is used widely for both geochemical and nuclear applications. Many adjustments to the classical measurement procedure have been made to reduce mass fractionation, and improve precision for small quantities and the minor ratios 236 U/ 238 U and 234 U/ 238 U (Quemet et al., 2019;Richter et al., 2011;Suzuki et al., 2010). Magnetic sector ICP-MS is also used widely for U isotopic analysis. Boulyga and Becker (2002) measured U isotopes in water (and soil following digestion and separation) and reported detection limits of 0.2 pg/L 236 U in water (0.04 ng/kg in soil) when used with a low-flow micro-concentric nebulizer. ICP tandem mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS) is a relatively new technique that augments ICP-MS by addition of a further quadrupole mass filter before the collision/reaction cell, improving the discrimination of the mass/charge ratio and increasing abundance sensitivity (Balcaen et al., 2015;Tanimizu et al., 2013). The technique has been used to determine 236 U/ 238 U isotopic ratios in environmental samples (Diez-Fernández et al., 2020). Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) has also been used, principally for the investigation of the long-half-life radionuclides including 236 U (Fahey et al., 2016;Hain et al., 2022;Hotchkis et al., 2002).</p>
        <p>Gamma spectrometry has also been used for the measurement of U isotopic ratios in both environmental and industrial samples (Ebaid, 2010).</p>
        <p>The behaviour of U in both the environment and the laboratory is linked closely to its chemical speciation. This is unusually complex given the propensity of U to hydrolyze and to form complexes and solids with common macro-ions, notably CO 3 2-, Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Na + and PO 4 3-. Some of the established techniques for obtaining information on individual chemical species and molecular structures are listed in Table 2.</p>
        <p>Sample digestion of geological materials precedes analysis by many of the methods described for aqueous samples, including ICP-MS, ICP-OES and laser fluorimetry (Ramdoss et al., 1997). A method for complete digestion of soil for U investigation was described and used by Regenspurg et al. (2010). Soil was microwave digested at 100 • C using HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 followed by HF and H 3 PO 3 . Radhamani et al. (2010) used NaH 2 PO 4 and Na 2 HPO 4 salts in equal proportion to dissolve refractory non-silicate minerals prior to analysis by laser fluorimetry.</p>
        <p>A sequential extraction approach to ascertain metal partitioning, optimized for investigation of the actinides, was described by Schultz</p>
        <p>a Detection limits vary depending on factors including preparation, methods, instrument used</p>
        <p>Techniques for acquiring information on uranium speciation. provides a sensitive way of resolving possible aqueous and surface interactions in sediments and soils Dangelmayr et al. (2017) Raman and Infrared spectroscopy (including attenuated total-reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ATR FTIR)</p>
        <p>Of value for U(VI) species (not U(IV) species) in solid, solution and adsorbed phases but spectral overlap and matrix effects can complicate Richter et al. (2016), Lu et al. (2018), Müller et al. (2008) et al. (1998). The extraction comprised six operationally defined fractions (MgCl 2 water-soluble, NH 4 Ac-HAc carbonate, NH 2 OH.HCl-HAc metal oxides, H 2 O 2 -HNO 3 organic matter, HNO 3 acid-soluble, NaOH fusion or HNO 3 /HCl/HF/HClO 4 residual). This broadly follows the method devised earlier for trace-metal extraction by Tessier et al. (1979). Extraction of U by bicarbonate (pH 8.7-9) under anoxic conditions is a useful addition (Cerrato et al., 2013;Zhou and Gu, 2005). Tarafder et al. (2015) designed a field-laboratory method for U in solids using fluorimetry preceded by solvent extraction to remove Fe which strongly quenches the fluorescence. The detection limit for this method was 0.2 mg/kg and precision 2-3% RSD. Fedotov et al. (2019) pre-concentrated and separated U and Th from Pb in Roman lead shields for measurement of ultra-trace U using counter-current (liquid-liquid) chromatography coupled with quadrupole ICP-MS. The detection limit for U was 3 ng/kg (Table 3).</p>
        <p>Laser-ablation (LA) ICP-MS is a long-established method for characterization of solid surfaces such as minerals. Spatial resolution is typically 20-200 μm (Eggins et al., 1998;Gäbler, 2002). Magnetic sector LA-ICP-MS provides greater sensitivity and isotopic ratio capability (Table 3).</p>
        <p>Spectrophotometry with organic dyes has been used widely for U measurement in environmental samples. Spectrophotometry was used with arsenazo-III as a chromogenic reagent and perchloric acid as medium of measurement in geological standard reference materials (Khan et al., 2006). Uranium contents of 0.05 mg/kg and more were detected (Table 3).</p>
        <p>Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) is a quantitative or semi-quantitative technique in which samples are irradiated with a neutron flux in a reactor. No sample pretreatment is required and the method is simple, cost-effective and non-destructive. Landsberger and Kapsimalis (2013) analyzed NIST standard reference materials and found interferences (e.g. 24 Na, 38 Cl, 56 Mn), could be reduced by Compton suppression. Detection limits were as low as 0.015 mg/kg, performing best with the use of epithermal as opposed to thermal neutrons. Haddad et al. (2021) compared INAA with alpha and gamma spectrometry methods for analysis of U in soils. They concluded that INAA was the preferred method; alpha and gamma spectrometry tended to overestimate U contents relative to INAA (Table 3).</p>
        <p>X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) can be used in wavelengthdispersive (Pandey et al., 2020) or energy-dispersive (Kumar and Dhara, 2022) mode, involves minimal sample preparation (typically pelletization) and has detection limits in the mg/kg range. Sample handling requirements in ore fields and contaminated sites have popularized field-portable XRF which is a rapid screening and non-destructive method, albeit of reduced sensitivity.</p>
        <p>Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) is a long-established method for determining elemental concentrations at point locations in minerals with a spatial resolution of typically a few μm. Secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is more sensitive and determines either concentrations or isotopic ratios in minerals with a spatial resolution of typically ca. 1 μm (Luo et al., 2015) (Table 3).</p>
        <p>Uranium can form more than 250 primary and secondary minerals (the more common shown in Table 4) with the redox state of the surrounding environment being a primary factor controlling formation.</p>
        <p>Analytical methods for analysis of geological and other solid materials.</p>
        <p>Many of the uranium minerals are yellow or greenish in colour. U(VI) minerals are more numerous than U(IV) minerals and just one U(V) mineral, wyartite, has been identified so far (Burns and Finch, 1999). The U(IV) minerals are typically primary oxides or silicates (Bowell et al., 2011). The oxygen and silicate moieties form covalent bonds with U(IV) and the minerals are typically sparingly soluble (Cumberland et al., 2016). The main ores are uraninite (UO 2 ), coffinite (U(SiO 4 ) 1-x (-OH) 4x ) and brannerite (UTi 2 O 6 ) (Table 4). Uraninite can also occur in its oxidized or partly oxidized massive form, pitchblende (U 3 O 8 ). Uranium ore grade material typically contains more than 0.1% U 3 O 8 . Uraninite forms under high-temperature conditions and is present in igneous rocks and hydrothermal assemblages. It can also form at low temperature under reducing conditions in sediments, often in replacement of fossil material and intimately associated with organic carbon and pyrite (Cumberland et al., 2016). Coffinite can also occur as a secondary alteration mineral, often replacing uraninite in Si-rich, anoxic groundwater conditions (Warner et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>Other rarer U(IV) ore minerals include davidite ((La,Ce)(Y,U,Fe)(Ti, Fe) 20 (O,OH) 38 ), which forms under high-temperature high-pressure conditions and was reported at the Radium Hill complex in South Australia, and betafite ((Ca,U) 2 (Nb,Ti) 2 O 6 OH), found in Rössing, Namibia (Table 4). The U-REE-Ti oxides all form solid solutions (Bowell et al., 2011). Thucholite is a rare amorphous bitumen-bearing U(IV) mineral observed in association with uraninite in palaeoplacers and in sediments including black shales (Luo et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>Uranium(VI) minerals are most commonly replacements of primary U(IV) minerals and are notable by the number of hydrated minerals formed. The U(VI) minerals include hydrated uranyl phosphates, silicates, vanadates, carbonates, arsenates and molybdates (Table 4). The most common U(VI) minerals are autunite (Ca(UO 2 ) 2 (PO 4 ) 2 ⋅10-12H 2 O) and uranophane (Ca(UO 2 ) 2 SiO 3 (OH) 2 ⋅5H 2 O). The U(VI) minerals commonly occur in the alteration zones of primary U ore deposits as a result of hydrothermal alteration or weathering, including oxidation (Jerden and Sinha, 2006;Murakami et al., 1997;Pérez et al., 2000;Porcelli and Swarzenski, 2003). Carnotite has been commonly associated with calcrete and gypsum deposits in arid areas (Fujii and Swain, 1995). A variety of exotic metal hydrates are also found as efflorescences on mine walls in U-rich environments. Uranophane has also been found in association with corrosion of cement waste in nuclear installations (Kienzler et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>The U oxide hydrate mineral, schoepite, occurs naturally through weathering. The synthetic uranium mineral metaschoepite (Table 4), is readily produced by alteration of schoepite under pressure at low temperature and by precipitation from uranyl-bearing solutions (Cot-Auriol et al., 2021;Weller et al., 2000). Metaschoepite formation is significant in the context of corrosion of U-based nuclear fuel and in laboratory experiments where a Na-rich background electrolyte is used.</p>
        <p>Of the rock-forming minerals, U(VI) partitions strongly with phosphate, iron oxides and clay minerals. Concentrations of U in the range 20-300 mg/kg have been reported for phosphate ores from the USA (EPA, 1991). Smith et al. (1996) reported concentrations of 75-200 mg/kg in phosphate ores from Jordan. Weathered saprolite overlying the Coles Hill uranium deposit in Virginia, USA contains barium metaautunite, a U(VI)-bearing phosphate mineral formed by alteration of primary coffinite and minor uraninite (Jerden et al., 2003). Uranium contents up to 1300 mg/kg were found in the lower part of the weathering profile, indicating enrichment relative to the unaltered primary ore. Similar associations between U and phosphate have also been found in the Southern Karoo province of South Africa and the Northwestern province of Zambia (Sanding and Bruno, 1992). Uranium also has a strong affinity for hydroxyapatite (Arey et al., 1999;Jerden andSinha, 2003, 2006).</p>
        <p>Uranium is found in association with goethite, hematite, ferrihydrite, magnetite and ilmenite (Bargar et al., 1999;Duff et al., 2002;Lahrouch et al., 2021;Missana et al., 2003;Payne et al., 1994;Schindler et al., 2010;Wazne et al., 2003;Zhao et al., 2012). These associations are commonly attributed to sorption of the uranyl ion (U(VI)O 2 2+ ) to surfaces (Bargar et al., 2000), although U(VI) can also be incorporated within the mineral structures (Duff et al., 2002). The uranium content of secondary iron oxides was in the range 773-4540 mg/kg (up to 8 wt % UO 3 ) (Sato et al., 1997) downgradient of a U deposit in Australia.</p>
        <p>Similarly, contents up to 2000 mg/kg were found in iron veins from Israel (Ilani et al., 1987). The largest contents were found in hematite. Both U(VI) and U(IV) have been found in pyrite, where contents have been reported up to 1000 mg/kg (Qafoku et al., 2009) (Table 5).</p>
        <p>Both U(IV) and U(VI) have been found to substitute for Ca 2+ in structural sites of calcite. Sturchio et al. (1998) reported contents of 5-35 mg/kg, principally as U(IV), in calcite from Zn ore deposits. Kelly et al. (2003) reported a U range of around 80-500 mg/kg U(VI) in a stable structural position in a natural calcite speleothem. U(VI) can also sorb to calcite surfaces (Ma et al., 2014). A very small U content (0.023 mg/kg) was found in marine foraminiferal tests cleaned to remove clay and oxides (Delaney and Boyle, 1983) (Table 5).</p>
        <p>Small amounts of U (&lt;1 mg/kg) are also typical in quartz from magmatic and metamorphic rocks (Table 5). However, larger contents have been found in macrocrystalline quartz and chalcedony in agates associated with late-stage or post-volcanic alteration or weathering (Götze et al., 2015). The U occurrence in agates was inferred as surface-bound uranyl and U contained within radiation-induced structural defects. Large contents of U have also been found in opal, e.g. 207 mg/kg (Neymark and Paces, 2000) or up to 20,000 mg/kg (Schindler et al., 2010). Opal forms as a low-temperature silica precipitate in freshwater environments (Neymark and Paces, 2000), as a wood replacement (Castor and Henry, 2000), from remains of diatoms and radiolaria in a marine environment (Bradtmiller et al., 2010) or as a product of low-temperature alteration of volcanic rocks (Schindler et al., 2010). Bright green fluorescence of uraniferous opal is well-recognised (Othmane et al., 2016;Schindler et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>Uranium is also concentrated in primary magmatic silicates, oxides and phosphates, especially zircon, titanite, monazite and allanite (Table 5). These occur in granitic rocks as accessory late-stage minerals (Porcelli and Swarzenski, 2003) and sedimentary rocks derived from them. Filippidis et al. (1997) reported a content of 157 mg/kg U in zircon from black heavy-mineral-bearing sands; Chentsov (1961) reported much larger contents of 1600-1860 mg/kg for zircon in granite and Moncur et al. (2011) up to 4000 mg/kg in detrital till. Amphiboles and micas in igneous rocks can also contain relatively large U contents (Table 5).</p>
        <p>Uranium ore deposits consist most commonly of uraninite (UO 2 ), pitchblende (U 3 O 8 ) and/or coffinite (U(SiO 4 ) 1-x (OH) 4x ) and their alteration products. Gangue minerals are typically quartz or carbonates (Dahlkamp, 2009). The ores may be monometallic or may occur combined with other amorphous trace metals (Co, Ni, Cu, Pb, Zn and Mo, V) as sulphides or arsenides. Pyrite and Fe oxides are ubiquitous (Dahlkamp, 2009).</p>
        <p>The largest deposits of economic U ore occur in Australia, Kazakhstan and Canada (NEA and OECD, 2020) (Fig. 1). Primary uranium minerals rarely occur in sufficient quantity in igneous rocks to reach economic grades; for that to occur, redistribution via hydrothermal or low-temperature fluids is necessary (Pownceby and Johnson, 2014). Uranium ores can be categorized broadly into igneous-type, hydrothermal-type or sandstone-type deposits (Andersen et al., 2017). Within these categories, a number of discrete geological settings have been described. The three most significant in terms of ore tonnage are unconformity-related, Fe ore-Cu-Au deposits and sandstone-hosted deposits (Cuney, 2008;Dahlkamp, 1993;NEA and OECD, 2020).</p>
        <p>Among the highest-grade and largest deposits in the world are the unconformity-related U ores. These occur at the unconformity between sandstones and underlying older metamorphic rocks. The two largest U deposits in the world occur in the McArthur River mine, Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, Canada (Chi et al., 2018;Cuney, 2005) and the Ranger deposit, McArthur Basin, Northern Territory, Australia (Fig. 1). The Athabasca Basin hosts the only known high-grade U ore (&gt;1% and up to 20% as U 3 O 8 ) (Chi et al., 2018;Dahlkamp, 2009). Operations at both mines have been suspended (Cameco, 2021).</p>
        <p>In the Athabasca Basin, redox processes have played a large role in determining U distributions. Organic-rich Palaeoproterozoic metasedimentary basement rocks underlie the unconformity, with relatively undeformed continental Palaeo-Mesoproterozoic sediments above (Bruce et al., 2020). Hot (160-220 • C), acidic, oxic, basinal brines (about 1540-1590 Ma age, Alexandre et al., 2007;Chi et al., 2018) are inferred to have migrated to the underlying reduced basement rocks, setting up a redox gradient with reductive immobilization of U ore at the unconformity and associated with reactivated basement faults (Cuney, 2005). Ore deposits may straddle the unconformity but are typically within the crystalline basement below, potentially extending some hundreds of metres below (Bruce et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Other large unconformity-related deposits in Australia include Jabiluka, Naberlek and Koongarra in Northern Territory and Kintyre in Western Australia (Dahlkamp, 2009;Pownceby and Johnson, 2014). Here too, U ore is emplaced through oxidizing hydrothermal fluids permeating the unconformity (Li et al., 2016). In these high-grade unconformity-related ores, mineral assemblages are typically dominated by uraninite, pitchblende, coffinite and brannerite (Bowell et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>Iron ore-Cu-Au assemblages in granite breccia are also a major locus of U mineralization. The Olympic Dam complex in South Australia is the best-known example and the largest resource of low-grade U in the world (Fig. 1). The deposit (around 0.05% U 3 O 8 ) hosts around 66% of Australia's U resources (Mudd, 2014), typically as brannerite. Hydrothermal fluids remobilized granite-hosted U and deposited it in greater concentration in quartz-hematite breccia. Olympic Dam is also the fourth largest copper deposit in the world and the majority of the revenue from the mine is generated from copper. Today, Olympic Dam is the only operational U mine in Australia.</p>
        <p>Uranium ores can also be hosted by sandstones, often arkosic, of continental or marginal marine origin. Examples of mined resources include Inkai, Kazakhstan and Smith Ranch-Highland, Wyoming, USA. Sandstone-hosted ore deposits are typically of low to medium grade (0.05-0.4% U 3 O 8 ). Uranium from proximal or parent U-bearing rocks (e. g. granite, pegmatite or black shale) or from intercalated volcanic beds (Abzalov, 2012), can be mobilized in oxic conditions as U(VI) until encountering anoxic conditions downgradient, at which point U is reduced and immobilized as U(IV). The U minerals commonly occur as roll-front deposits, the term reflecting the potential for reoxidation and mobilization in a dynamic system (Langmuir, 1978). The deposits are typically arcuate in cross section, and sinuous or irregular in plan view. Forms reflect the interactions of groundwater flow paths with the surrounding rock and may cut across bedding planes. Intermontane basins are a common environment for roll-front deposits and the occurrences can be laterally extensive. The Inkai deposit of Kazakhstan extends for some 100 km (Cuney, 2008). Uranium minerals in roll fronts have been identified typically as uraninite, pitchblende and coffinite, although U (IV) adsorbed to amorphous metal oxides or organic matter also occur (Bhattacharyya et al., 2017). Sandstone-deposited U ore may also be in tabular form, in basal channels where U may be immobilized in the presence of organic matter such as lignite (e.g. Monument Valley, Colorado Plateau, USA), or as deposits in fault zones, e.g. Arlit deposit, Niger, (Fig. 1) (Abzalov, 2012). The U mineralization in sandstone-hosted deposits can be accompanied by other redox-controlled trace elements including Se, Mo and V (Bullock and Parnell, 2017;Reynolds and Goldhaber, 1983). Most of the world's sandstone-hosted deposits date to around 850-540 Ma (Jaireth et al., 2016). Uranium deposits may also occur in quartz-pebble conglomerates. These are deposits from alluvial fans or braided streams where detrital uraninite was deposited as placers, concentrated by gravity. These are the oldest U deposits, identified in eight locations globally, including the Huronian Supergroup, Ontario, Canada and the Witwatersrand Supergroup in South Africa. These types of U deposit predate the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) at around 2.4 Ga and were transported at a time when atmospheric oxygen was inferred to be absent. They are restricted to Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic ages. The GOE marked the appearance of atmospheric oxygen and therefore a shift in the redox status and hence mobilization mechanisms of U (Cumberland et al., 2016;Holland, 2005). The subsequent increase in U(VI) mobilization was linked with oxidative weathering.</p>
        <p>In granitic rocks or around their margins, U can occur in veins and stockworks and grades are low to medium, ranging up to a few percent (Dahlkamp, 2009). The deposits derive from late-stage magmatic fluids circulating in fractures and joints. This type is responsible for much of the U mineralization occurring in Europe (e.g. France, Germany, Czech Republic) where U minerals are hosted by Variscan peraluminous leucogranites (Dahlkamp, 2016), emplaced during extensional tectonism in the late Carboniferous/early Permian. Uranium mineralization has much less association with granitic rocks of the Caledonian and Alpine orogens in Europe (Dahlkamp, 2016). Uranium deposition is believed to be due to the mixing of oxic fluids leaching uraninite from granites with reducing groundwater from nearby sedimentary basins (Cuney, 2008). The mineralogy is typically dominated by uraninite. The largest resources across Europe occur in veins in the Massif Central, Armorican Massif and Vosges of France, the Iberian Meseta of Spain and the Bohemian Massif and Erzgebirge of Central Europe (Dahlkamp, 2016).</p>
        <p>As U is a lithophile element, its content in the crust is higher than in the mantle (2.8 mg/kg and up to 0.022 mg/kg respectively, Table 6). Uranium contents of rocks are typically around 1-4 mg/kg (Drever, 1997;Hess et al., 1985;Taylor and McLennan, 1985) although as detailed in Section 3.2, larger contents can occur in granitic rocks, pegmatites, organic-rich-rocks, argillaceous sediments (clays, shales) and Fe-and PO 4 -rich rocks (Table 6).</p>
        <p>In igneous rocks, U is an incompatible element as it does not fit readily into the crystal structure of many rock-forming silicates. Contents increase in acidic rocks through fractional crystallization. Relatively large U contents can be found in granites, especially peralkaline types. In peralkaline rhyolites, U can be present in glass, from which the U is readily released on devitrification (Cuney, 2008). Peralkaline nepheline syenites can also have large contents. These are the products of extreme fractional crystallization of highly evolved magmas and can accumulate incompatible elements and volatiles under closed-system conditions. Similar accumulations can also occur in late-stage pegmatites, commonly as uraninite. Popit et al. (2004) noted ranges for felsic igneous rocks of 3-4 mg/kg compared to intermediate igneous rocks (around 1.5 mg/kg), basic igneous rocks (around 0.6 mg/kg) and ultrabasic rocks (around 0.03 mg/kg). Langmuir (1978) reported contents in granite of 2.2-15 mg/kg. Simpson et al. (1979) found a range of &lt;1-67 mg/kg for granites of various ages across the British Isles; of these, largest contents are present in the Variscan granites of south-west England. The U in British granites is concentrated in zircon, monazite and uraninite as primary magmatic minerals, but also redistributed in hydrothermal veins and secondary minerals such as kaolinite and Fe oxide (Poole, 2001;Simpson et al., 1979). Contents of 20-54 mg/kg were reported from the Stripa granite, Sweden (Andrews et al., 1989) (Table 6), where uraninite was found to be the main U mineral. Peralkaline nepheline syenites from the Ilímaussaq intrusion of southern Greenland have reported contents of 32-338 mg/kg (Sørrensen, 1992). Associated hydrothermal veins contain pitchblende while skarns produced by contact metasomatism contain uranopyrochlore and betafite.</p>
        <p>In sedimentary rocks, the largest U contents are typically found in organic-rich deposits, including black shale, peat and coal, and in phosphorites. Accumulations of U can exceed those in parent igneous or metamorphic rocks. The organic matter can produce reducing conditions favouring the precipitation of U(IV) minerals such as coffinite, U (SiO 4 ) 1-x (OH) 4x (Xu et al., 2015) and a 238 U-heavy form of biogenic uraninite containing 'non-crystalline' U(IV) (Stylo et al., 2015). However, not all analyses support this reductive mechanism (Cumberland et al., 2018). Uranium can also bind strongly to organic matter as both U (IV) and U(VI). A U content of 56 mg/kg was reported for a black shale from the Appalachian Basin, USA (Leventhal et al., 1986) and 10-56 mg/kg were found in Cretaceous oil shales from northern Negev, Israel (Ilani et al., 1987). Bottrell (1993) found U contents in the range 5-10 mg/kg in UK Carboniferous shales, while values of 10-60 mg/kg were reported by Ball et al. (1992) (Table 6). Carboniferous black shales in south-west England have contents of 5-21 mg/kg (Ball and Miles, 1993).</p>
        <p>Contents of U in the range 0.2-9 mg/kg were found in peats variably impacted by inputs from agricultural drainage in Florida, USA (Zielinski et al., 2000). The U was considered dominantly partitioned with organic carbon. Holocene peat deposits from Scotland have contents in excess of 200 mg/kg (Read et al., 1993). Contents up to 4000 mg/kg were found in Swiss peats (Regenspurg et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>Eocene lignite deposits formed in palaeochannels in Gunbarrel Basin, Western Australia have U contents up to 5870 mg/kg (Table 6). Original U sources were taken to be nearby lamproite and carbonatite intrusive rocks with redistribution following weathering (Douglas et al., 2011). The U is principally associated with organic matter in the deposits, though minor coffinite and uraninite are present. Large contents are also found in coal, e.g. 66-288 mg/kg (Bowen, 1979;Dai et al., 2015;Galhardi and Bonotto, 2017).</p>
        <p>Elevated U contents can be found in argillaceous deposits but these tend to be lower than organic-rich types. Argillaceous marine deposits in the range 2-14 mg/kg are typical (Bowie et al., 1979;McManus et al., 2005) (Table 6).</p>
        <p>Uranium is present in large concentrations in phosphorites. These Prich deposits form in shallow continental shelves with restricted circulation (Cuney, 2008). One of the best-known examples is the Late Cretaceous uraniferous phosphorite belt of the Middle East which extends from Turkey to Morocco via Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and Egypt. These deposits contain typically 120-130 mg/kg U (Dahlkamp, 2009). Sedimentary phosphorites consist in large part of francolite, a carbonate-rich fluorapatite (Ca 10 (PO 4 ) 6-x (CO 3 ) x (F,OH) 2+x ).</p>
        <p>Uranium contents of continental red-bed sandstones can also be relatively large in places, likely dependent on associations with Fe oxides and/or phosphate minerals. In the oldest red beds known, Palaeoproterozoic deposits of the Francheville Basin, Gabon, have contents in the range 0.43-75.6 mg/kg with higher values in the finer fraction (Bankole et al., 2016). In the continental red-bed Devonian sandstone of Scotland, contents up to 1300 mg/kg have been found in phosphate-rich horizons (Michie, 1970). In the red-bed Triassic Sandstone of England, a range of 0.5-11 mg/kg has been reported (Table 6), again with highest values in finer-grained horizons (Cuttell et al., 1988). Weibel and Friis (2004) observed phosphatic coffinite in the mineralized cores of reduction spots in the Triassic (Bunter) Sandstone of Germany.</p>
        <p>Limestones typically contain relatively small amounts of U unless associated with mineralization. An average U content of 1.3 mg/kg was quoted for limestones by Eisenbud and Gesell (1997) (Table 6). Ivanovich and Alexander (1985) determined average values of 2.03 mg/kg for the English Chalk. Contents of 0.05-6.3 mg/kg were given for the Chalk by Murphy (1998), but pure carbonate samples were usually found to have &lt;1 mg/kg with higher values in marls and hardgrounds. These may have contained U-bearing phosphate.</p>
        <p>By contrast, contents can be extremely large in calcrete deposits from U mineralized areas. Ranges in valley-fill and playa calcretes of the Archaean Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia have in the range of 10-10,000 mg/kg U and associated large contents of V. The U occurs almost invariably as carnotite (Table 4) and is present as void and fracture coatings and finely disseminated grains in playas. The calcretes, formed by evaporation, include calcite and dolomite with lesser amounts of aragonite, clays including sepiolite and occasional gypsum and halite. Oxic evaporitic conditions favoured the precipitation of uranyl vanadate (Butt et al., 1977).</p>
        <p>Red-bed tidal-flat and alluvial-fan deposits from Baja California were found to have U contents of 1.8-4.3 mg/kg (Zielinski et al., 1983). The U was concentrated either in the rare refractory minerals or adsorbed to more widely disseminated detrital magnetite grains or authigenic mineral surface coatings. The quartz and feldspar minerals forming the bulk of the rock had small U contents (Zielinski et al., 1983).</p>
        <p>Average contents of U in soil are around 2 mg/kg (Dissanayake and Chandrajith, 2009). The median content of U in 5700 surface soils from England and Wales was 2.2 mg/kg (Rawlins et al., 2012). Unfertilized soils from Florida, USA, were reported to contain 0.3-0.9 mg/kg U (Zielinski et al., 2006) (Table 6). Soils from control areas not affected by U mining activity in southern China had contents of 2.1-3.1 mg/kg (Shi et al., 2021). Contents of 1.62-19.8 mg/kg were found in soils over metamorphic rocks (schist/gneiss) from Himachal Pradesh, India (Singh et al., 2001) reflecting increased U content of bedrock sources. Small increases have been recorded in phosphate-fertilized soils: Zielinski et al. (2006) reported a range of 1.0-1.4 mg/kg in fertilized soils from Florida, USA, slightly above the 0.3-0.9 mg/kg baseline range.</p>
        <p>Jordan &lt;48-1068 Xoubi (2015) Strong binding of U to soil organic matter means that significant enrichments can be observed in organic-rich soils, in both natural and contaminated settings. Uranium contents of 25-4000 mg/kg were found in Swiss natural organic-rich wetland soils, U correlating well with soil organic carbon content (Regenspurg et al., 2010). Contents of 3.78-281 mg/kg were found in industrially contaminated organic-rich wetland soils of South Carolina, USA (Kaplan et al., 2017). Contents in the range 2-3280 mg/kg were also reported in peat from Colorado, USA in areas close to old mine workings (Owen and Otton, 1995). These studies typically show U(VI) dominance, despite often reducing conditions, and a strong association of the uranyl with the humic fraction.</p>
        <p>Large U contents can be seen more generally in soils proximal to U mining or mineralized areas. For example, in areas close to abandoned U mines, contents of 1.44-416 mg/kg have been reported in China (Shi et al., 2021), &lt;25-337 mg/kg in Portugal (Neiva et al., 2014) and 111-1690 mg/kg in England (Corkhill et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>Lanzoni (2019) reported concentrations of dissolved U up to 0.007 μg/L in snowfall and up to 0.10 μg/L in rainfall from the San Luis Valley, Colorado, USA (Table 7). Post et al. (2017) found 0.031 μg/L U in rainwater from Burundi. Specific events can lead to anomalous concentrations of U in rainfall. For example, the breakup of the Helens in 1980 (Sakuragi et al., 1983).</p>
        <p>Uranium concentrations of typically less than around 4 μg/L have been reported in river water. A worldwide average of 0.3 μg/L has been reported (Mangini et al., 1979). A range of 0.23-3.5 μg/L was found in rivers of Germany (Mangini et al., 1979), while Regenspurg et al. (2010) found 2.4 μg/L in the Dischmar River of Switzerland. Indian rivers have a typical range of 0.92-5.37 μg/L (Singh et al., 1996). Concentrations in the River Clyde of Scotland were &lt;0.02-1.24 μg/L (Smedley et al., 2017). The Yellow River, China, provides about 1% of the global dissolved flux of U to the sea, probably its single largest source, with monthly samples taken in 2010 at Lijn close to the estuary ranging from 3.85 to 7.57 μg/L (Juanjuan et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>Concentrations can be higher in small-order streams, depending on local geology and land use. For European first-order streams, the FOREGS (Forum of European Geological Surveys) geochemical database provides a range for U of &lt;0.002-21.4 μg/L (Salminen et al., 2005).</p>
        <p>Distributions are strongly controlled by geology and by streamwater pH, higher concentrations occurring in relatively alkaline streams. Highest values are observed in: (i) the Baltic countries, with dominant rock types including marl, limestone, dolomite and phosphorite; (ii) northern Poland on superficial deposits; (iii) Hungary on Alpine rocks; (iv) the southern Iberian Peninsula on Variscan granites; (v) southern Italy on alkaline volcanic rocks, and (vi) southern Germany on Mesozoic rocks (Fig. 2). Isolated high concentrations are also seen in areas of known U mineralization, e.g. Essone river valley, France; southern Polish border; Badajoz, south-west Spain. Low concentrations occur over much of Scandinavia, which is characterized by Precambrian Shield and Caledonide bedrocks, as well as the UK, which also includes Caledonides, and Denmark which has superficial deposits over Precambrian Shield formations. Low concentrations are also seen over Variscan formations of the north-west and central Iberian Peninsula, Massif Central and northern France, and south-west England.</p>
        <p>In the Clyde catchment around Glasgow, Scotland, mapping of U in streamwaters (&lt;0.003-10.8 μg/L) also showed a strong geological control, with pH having an influence. Lowest U concentrations occurred in upland areas in the north-west of the catchment (Fig. 3). These overlie basaltic rocks of the Clyde Plateau Volcanic Formation and the upland soils are commonly peaty; streams in this area are the most acidic of the catchment (pH 4-7) and carbonate poor. Streams overlying Ordovician and Silurian rocks at the southern end of the catchment also had low U concentrations. Highest concentrations were in streams over Devonian red-bed sandstone and Carboniferous Scottish Coal Measures Group. The former contains iron oxides and some phosphate minerals; the latter is an organic-rich deposit. Concentrations in the Clyde river waters generally reflected diluted forms of the contributing streams (Smedley et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>In streams from Germany, Birke et al. (2009) found a range of 0.007-43.7 μg/L (Table 7). Highest concentrations were in mining areas and relative highs were also associated with streams over Triassic red-bed Bunter and Keuper sediments. In France, slightly high U concentrations (2.4-5.7 μg/L) were found in streams passing through a peat bog (water pH ca. 6) downgradient of former U mines. However, in these the dominant U fraction was found to be in the particulate and colloidal rather than dissolved fraction (Phrommavanh et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>In the Yukon, Canada, streamwater U concentrations are reported in the range &lt;1-340 μg/L, the concentrations influenced by the presence of mineralized bodies, including the Coffee Au-sulphide deposit and Casino Cu-Au-Mo porphyry deposit. Both these areas had U concentrations in surface water usually above 15 μg/L (Skierszkan et al., 2020a). Two samples of surface water in a U mineralized area, El Allouga mine, Sinai, Egypt had concentrations of 600-1130 μg/L (Ramadan et al., 2022). Application of phosphate fertilizer has often been cited as a contributory source of U in surface waters (e.g. Schnug and Lottermoser, 2013) (Section 5.3). Concentrations greater than 2 μg/L in the Birke et al. (2009) study were prevalent in agricultural areas. Drainage from phosphate-fertilized peats in the northern Everglades, USA, showed increased concentrations (0.3-2.4 μg/L) compared to unfertilized peat (&lt;0.1 μg/L) (Zielinski et al., 2000), again suggesting an additional phosphate fertilizer source. Concentrations of U in runoff from agricultural pastureland elsewhere in central Florida were lower than for the peat study (Table 7) but still higher than for natural grassland sites. The low overall dissolved concentrations were considered to be due to sorption of U to organic carbon in the soils (Zielinski et al., 2006).</p>
        <p>Uranium concentrations in alkaline and saline lakes from the central Rift Valley of Ethiopia have concentrations in the range 0.2-73.5 μg/L (Rango et al., 2010). Values were &lt;10 μg/L in all but one sample. This had a pH of 10 and alkalinity as HCO 3 of 38,600 mg/L. Mono Lake, California, USA, had concentrations of around 554 μg/L (Simpson et al., 1982). Hyperalkaline groundwater-fed soda lakes from eastern Mongolia also had a range of 57-1490 μg/L with a typical pH of 10 Linhoff et al., 2011). High U concentrations were attributed to evaporation; the original U source was inferred to be alkaline rhyolites.</p>
        <p>High concentrations of U have also been found in some acid mine drainage. Hejiacun U mine in Hunan Province, China, produces acid mine drainage with U concentrations in the range 0.014-1370 μg/L and associated high concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cd, Cu, As, Ni and Zn. Black shales of the region host pyrite along with autunite, cuprouranite and uraninite. Concentrations of U were observed decreasing along a 1.2 km stretch of stream flowing downgradient from the mine adit discharge point, with pH rising from 2.76 to 7.77 along the stretch (Peng et al., 2009).</p>
        <p>Uranium concentrations in the range 6000-14000 μg/L were also found in surface drainage from Poços de Caldas U Mine in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The water had a pH of 2.7 with high concentrations of SO 4 , F and Fe. Dissolved U was mainly in the form UO 2 (SO 4 ) 3 4- (Ladeira and Gonçalves, 2007). Similarly, drainage from Curilo U mine, Bulgaria, had a pH of 2.5-4.0 with high concentrations of U (100-2750 μg/L) and other dissolved metals (Groudev et al., 2007). Lower but still elevated concentrations (0.26-18.5 μg/L) were found in the Tinto River, Spain in water affected by acid mine drainage from the Iberian Pyrite Belt (Hierro et al., 2013). Seasonal variability in U concentrations of surface waters has been observed in response to cyclical changes in physico-chemical conditions (pH, redox) caused for example by varying inputs of rainfall and temperature-dependent biological activity (Ma et al., 2011;Mochizuki et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Supply of U to seawater derives from river inputs as well as potentially from groundwater. In open seawater, U behaves conservatively and occurs as uranyl (U(VI)), mainly complexed with carbonate and Ca/ Mg. Under these conditions, uranyl has a long residence time of some hundreds of thousands of years (Barnes and Cochran, 1990;Henderson and Anderson, 2003). In open seawater, U is present in concentrations of around 3.3 μg/L (Table 7). Its removal from solution occurs via reduction to U(IV) and sequestration in reducing organic-rich sediments or carbonates (Andersen et al., 2017;Klinkhammer and Palmer, 1991;Mangini et al., 1979;Russell et al., 1994). Uranium is also removed from solution as U(IV) in high-temperature hydrothermal zones at mid-ocean ridges (Chen et al., 1986).</p>
        <p>Reducing organic-rich, U-rich sediments occur in anoxic basins and pelagic and estuarine environments. Nonetheless, the reduction from U (VI) to U(IV) can be slow and not necessarily within the anoxic water column. Anderson et al. (1989) noted U concentrations in a Black Sea profile of 1.31-2.13 μg/L, varying with salinity, but with the lowest values in the deepest part at 2000 m depth. No inflection in concentrations was visible at the O 2 /H 2 S interface, and U was maintained as U (VI) throughout the profile. Similar observations were made for the Cariaco Basin (Anderson, 1987). Estimated U residence times in the anoxic, sulphidic bottom waters in both areas were inferred as a thousand years or more, much longer than would be anticipated for reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) in the water column (Anderson, 1987;Anderson et al., 1989). Accumulation of U(IV) in the sulphidic bottom sediments (Degens et al., 1977) was attributed to slow kinetics of U(VI) reduction to U(IV), the process taking place within the sediments rather than the overlying water column (Anderson et al., 1989). Diffusion of U across the sediment-water interface has also been shown by enrichments in marine porewaters from organic-rich sediments (Klinkhammer and Palmer, 1991). Reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) was inferred as coincident with SO 4 reduction, resulting ultimately in the formation of uraninite, possibly via a U(V) metastable phase. Sanders et al. (2017) noted a U range of 0.90-5.95 μg/L (salinity-corrected) in estuarine waters off New South Wales, Australia. The U correlated positively with dissolved Fe, suggesting that reductive dissolution of Fe oxides released U, causing increased concentrations in solution relative to seawater. Concentrations in a transect across the Alafia River/estuarine mixing zone of Tampa, Florida, USA were in the range 0.86-3.97 μg/L, also indicative of non-conservative mixing, with U possibly contributed from dissolution of carbonate rocks, discharge of groundwater and/or from local phosphate mining (Swarzenski and Baskaran, 2006). Relatively high concentrations (3.85-7.57 μg/L) were also recorded in the Yellow River estuary, China, and attributed to desorption of U from loess river-bed sediments (Juanjuan et al., 2014). Swarzenski et al. (2004) noted a U range of 0.056-3.22 μg/L across the Amazon estuary with net loss of U, attributed to sorption to metal oxides. Sarin and Church (1994) also noted losses of U due to sorption to Fe oxides or reduction to U(IV) in the Delaware estuary, USA. Charette and Sholkovitz (2006) reported slight net U loss from estuarine water from Cape Cod, USA. Similarly, Hierro et al. (2013) concluded that U in acidic mine-affected river water adsorbed to Fe oxides in estuarine waters on mixing with seawater. Estuaries have been inferred as either net sources or net sinks of U depending on redox conditions, pH and seasonal variability (Hierro et al., 2013;Juanjuan et al., 2014;Sanders et al., 2017), the dominant processes being site-specific (Swarzenski and Baskaran, 2006).</p>
        <p>Groundwaters can contain substantially higher U concentrations Fig. 2. Uranium concentrations in European streamwaters (FOREGS) (Salminen et al., 2005). Geochemical Atlas of Europe; copyright © 2005 the Association of the Geological Surveys of The European Union (EuroGeoSurveys)/the Geological Survey of Finland. than adjacent surface waters (Table 8). Concentrations in groundwater significantly above the provisional WHO (2017) guideline value (30 μg/L) have been reported in numerous countries, including India, Australia, Canada, USA, as well as locations in South Korea, Burundi, China, Cyprus, Iraq, Portugal, southern Finland and South Africa (Fig. 4). In many other countries, concentrations in groundwater close to the WHO guideline value have also been found. Reporting has been sporadic: in many countries, U in water has not been measured routinely because of a lack of regulation until recently.</p>
        <p>Distributions in India are among the best-documented, with numerous groundwater studies having been carried out over several decades. A recent national compilation of 54,618 analyses of groundwater in India has given a range of U concentrations of ≤0.2-4918 μg/L (median 1.9 μg/L) (Sahoo et al., 2021). Concentrations substantially above 30 μg/L have been reported in Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Haryana, Karnataka, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and West Bengal. Large areas of peninsular India have high concentrations in groundwater from areas of Archaean granitic and Proterozoic granitic gneiss basement.</p>
        <p>In northern Rajasthan concentrations of 2.54-133 μg/L were reported by Rani et al. (2013a), almost all being greater than 30 μg/L. A range of 11-63 μg/L was found in Uttar Pradesh (Kumar et al., 2015) and 0.8-72 μg/L were found in Tamil Nadu (Adithya et al., 2019). Uranium concentrations in the range 0.2-68 μg/L (Brindha et al., 2011) and 7-370 μg/L (Keesari et al., 2014) have been reported in groundwater from granitic rocks in Nalgonda district of Telangana; 22% and 68% respectively were above 30 μg/L (Brindha et al., 2011;Keesari et al., 2014). The granites of the district are also relatively enriched in U (Table 6).</p>
        <p>In Karnataka, a range of 0.3-1443 μg/L was reported by Babu et al. (2008) and of 1-5995 μg/L by Srinivasan et al. (2021). Here, 78% were &gt;30 μg/L. Higher values were observed in the dry season than during the monsoon. High concentrations are associated with granite bedrock, in Archaean rocks of the Dharwar craton (Srinivasan et al., 2021). Concentrations of 0.2-589 μg/L were also reported for groundwater from granitic areas in Karnataka; 30% were greater than 30 μg/L and most were less than 130 μg/L (Lapworth et al., 2021). Coyte et al. (2018) found high concentrations in groundwater from granite and metamorphic basement rocks from Rajasthan and Gujarat.</p>
        <p>In Rajasthan, 33% of groundwater samples exceeded 30 μg/L and in Gujarat, the exceedance was 5%. The high concentrations were associated with high alkalinity under oxic conditions. A statistically significant decrease in U concentration with depth was observed in Gujarat samples. The groundwaters also had high F, salinity and nitrate concentrations.</p>
        <p>High concentrations also occur in large regions of Punjab, either in association with granitic basement aquifers or the Quaternary alluvial Indo-Gangetic plains. Kochhar et al. (2007) found high concentrations and DPHE, 2001). Many of these groundwaters are strongly reducing.</p>
        <p>High U concentrations (0.1-556 μg/L) were noted in groundwater from the Indus basin of Punjab, Pakistan. Concentrations were highest in Lahore district. Relative highs were also seen in Sindh, Pakistan (range 0.8-59 μg/L). Groundwater was pH-neutral to alkaline (7.1-9.0), and appeared to be oxic (low Mn concentrations) where U concentrations were highest (Ali et al., 2019). Concentrations tend to be lower (&lt;30 μg/L) in groundwater from the Miocene-Pleistocene sedimentary aquifers of the Siwalik Group of Himachal Pradesh, northern India (Rani et al., 2013b;Singh et al., 2001).</p>
        <p>In South Korea, the Icheon granite has associated groundwater U concentrations of 0.02-1640 μg/L, 11% of samples exceeding 30 μg/L (Jo et al., 2011). Groundwater is mostly slightly acidic although the pH range is 5.38-8.15; groundwater is oxic (NO 3 -bearing). A similarly large range of concentrations (&lt;0.01-3610 μg/L) was also reported by Shin et al. (2016) for a wider area of granitic rocks of South Korea; some 4% exceeded 30 μg/L. Concentrations of 0.54-263 μg/L were found in groundwater from the Okchun area of South Korea where black shales and granite occur; higher concentrations were found in hot springs than cold springs in the area (Lee et al., 2001).</p>
        <p>In the Datong Basin, China, groundwater U concentrations of &lt;0.02-288 μg/L, 24% above 30 μg/L, were reported by Wu et al. (2014).</p>
        <p>Groundwater is from a Quaternary alluvial aquifer and is alkaline (pH 7.36-9.58, HCO 3 up to 1500 mg/L) and oxic. In the Quaternary alluvial aquifer of the Huhhot Basin of China, a much lower range of &lt;0.01-53 μg/L was reported (Smedley et al., 2003). These are also alkaline, but are predominantly strongly (SO 4 -) reducing. In north-east China, concentrations in the range 0.18-453 μg/L have been found above sandstone-hosted and granitic U mineralized areas of the Erlian Basin (B. Zhang et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>In Mongolia, groundwaters from Dornogobi Aimag Province alluvium have U in the range &lt;0.24-429 μg/L, 36% of analyzed samples being above 30 μg/L. Higher concentrations were present in shallow (&lt;10 m) than deeper (&gt;50 m) groundwater sources. Groundwater pH was 6.4-9.7. Uranium covaried with Mo and As as well as Mn (Nriagu et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>In Western Australia, the Yilgarn Craton has high recorded U groundwater concentrations close to palaeochannel-related U mineralization where the dominant mineral is carnotite hosted by calcrete.</p>
        <p>Uranium concentrations up to 696 μg/L occur in and around the U mineralized areas. The main source of U is granite (Butt et al., 1977;Noble et al., 2011). Around the Koongarra uranium deposit, concentrations up to 440 μg/L occur in groundwater above the deposit although they are lower (&lt;30 μg/L) both upstream and downstream of it (Payne, 1991;Payne and Airey, 2006;Yanase et al., 1995) (Section 8.2).</p>
        <p>In the USA, high U concentrations have been documented in a number of areas, including the High Plains aquifer, Central Valley of California, Carson Desert of Nevada, New Mexico, New England and Florida, as well as localized occurrences in areas of known U mineralization. The USGS National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) survey of groundwater showed a range up to 550 μg/L, concentrations were found to be significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0001) in dry areas (range &lt;0.21-550 μg/L) than humid areas (range &lt;0.006-440 μg/L) (Ayotte et al., 2011) (see also Fig. 18, Section 8.5).</p>
        <p>In the Central Valley, concentrations of &lt;0.5-5400 μg/L have been found (Nolan and Weber, 2015); concentrations up to 5400 μg/L were also reported for the area by Fujii and Swain (1995). Complexation with CO 3 and PO 4 were suggested as mechanisms for U mobility in these groundwaters. Concentrations up to 550 μg/L have also been reported for groundwater from Quaternary aeolian, lacustrine and alluvial deposits of the Carson Desert of Nevada, USA (Welch and Lico, 1998). High values were taken to be due to evaporation although additional release from metal oxides under mildly reducing conditions (likely Mn-reducing, with dissolved oxygen concentrations &lt;1 mg/L) was also proposed. The sediments were derived ultimately from granitic and tuffaceous rocks and these might be the original sources of U. The similarities in geological setting with sandstone-type U deposits were noted by Welch and Lico (1998).</p>
        <p>The major Plio-Pleistocene High Plains aquifer encompasses eight states across central USA from South Dakota to Texas. Sediments comprise mainly alluvial deposits. Groundwater U concentrations in the range &lt;0.5-2670 μg/L were reported by Nolan and Weber (2015). High concentrations of NO 3 were also reported. Linhoff et al. (2016) found a U range of &lt;0.2-1820 μg/L in groundwater from Miocene alluvial, lacustrine and tuff fan deposits of the Española Basin, New Mexico. pH was in the range 5.8-9.6 and HCO 3 18.3-2380 mg/L. High concentrations of U were associated with highs of F (&lt;1-6.5 mg/L), Mo (&lt;1-136 μg/L), V (&lt;1-373 μg/L) and As (&lt;0.2-89.5 μg/L). TDS was typically high (7-11,350 mg/L). Aquifer sediments are weathered from volcanic precursors and U roll-front deposits occur in the vicinity; both were considered likely origins of the aqueous U (Linhoff et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>In Texas, mixed Cretaceous sediments of the Edwards-Trinity aquifer, largely comprising sand but including limestone and evaporite, have oxic groundwater with pH in the range 6.07-7.6 and U concentrations of &lt;1-154 μg/L (Hudak, 2018). Some 29% of sampled wells had U concentrations greater than 30 μg/L. The aquifer is hydraulically connected to the Mio-Pliocene High Plains aquifer in its northern 8).</p>
        <p>margins (Barker et al., 1994).</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, Gross and Brown (2020) found over 100 private water-supply wells with U concentrations greater than 30 μg/L (range &lt;1-3170 μg/L, median &lt;1 μg/L). High concentrations were in groundwater from bedrock including granite, gneiss and pelite, but also included mafic rocks, e.g. norite.</p>
        <p>In and around Greenville County, South Carolina, high U concentrations (up to 7780 μg/L) have been found in groundwater from granitic and granite-gneiss basement rocks (Orloff et al., 2004;Warner et al., 2011). Sources were inferred to be primary uraninite and secondary coffinite in the granite matrix and fractures. Secondary calcite and Ca zeolite were also present. Uranium concentrations correlated with groundwater pH and alkalinity and were highest where pH was in the range 7.25-8.25 and HCO 3 greater than 55 mg/L (Warner et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>In Florida, NAWQA data indicate occurrence of groundwater with concentrations greater than 30 μg/L (Figs. 4 and 18). Concentrations are elevated in superficial deposits compared to underlying limestone and pumping-induced drawdown to the main Florida limestone aquifer may be responsible (Ayotte et al., 2011). Shallow groundwater from Florida in superficial deposits containing weathered phosphate minerals is also reported to contain U at concentrations in the range &lt;1-460 μg/L (Missimer et al., 2019). Jerden and Sinha (2003) reported three analyses for groundwater, each with U &lt; 15 μg/L, in the Coles Hill U deposit of Virginia, USA. The site contained a reduced primary ore zone of uraninite and coffinite with a shallow oxic weathered zone with U phosphate mineralization. The low solubility of Ba meta-autunite was inferred as the cause of the low concentrations. In contrast, high U concentrations (95-333 μg/L) were reported in shallow groundwater from an unconfined alluvial aquifer contaminated from a former uranium ore processing plant at Rifle, Colorado, USA (Anderson et al., 2003).</p>
        <p>In Canada, the Lac du Bonnet granite of Manitoba hosts groundwater with U concentrations of &lt;0.5-837 μg/L. Wells are shallow and many have been used for drinking water. Groundwater is oxic and alkaline (HCO 3 up to 1000 mg/L) and with pH of mostly 8.0-8.5; groundwater is calcite-saturated (Gascoyne, 1989). Uranyl carbonates are taken to be the dominant species with U derived from the granitic rocks (U typically 6.5 mg/kg) (Gascoyne, 1989). In the Yukon of Canada, U in groundwater was found to be higher in rocks dominated by gneiss and schists than granite bedrocks. The former contained carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite, ankerite, siderite) and these were considered instrumental in increasing U mobility by facilitating the formation of dissolved Ca-U-carbonate species. Granitic bedrock had &lt;1 wt% carbonate, with lower groundwater Ca concentrations, alkalinity and undersaturation with calcite (Skierszkan et al., 2020a). The area is also mineralized, hosting the Coffee Au-sulphide deposit and the Casino Cu-Au-Mo porphyry deposit.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Cramer (1986) reported U concentrations only up to 11.9</p>
        <p>μg/L in groundwater from the unconformity-type U deposit of Cigar Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada. Groundwater was mostly pH-neutral with low alkalinity (HCO 3 4-125 mg/L); the groundwater sampled in this study was anoxic due to flow restrictions caused by clays overlying the U deposit.</p>
        <p>In Argentina, concentrations in the range 1.45-365 μg/L were found in Córdoba Province (Nicolli et al., 1989), 8.8-97 μg/L in Valle de la Cruz, Córdoba (Matteoda et al., 2019) and 6.2-250 μg/L in La Pampa Province (Smedley et al., 2002). Groundwaters in these areas are from Quaternary loess deposits with interbedded rhyolitic or dacitic volcanic ash and occur under oxic and alkaline conditions (Section 8.4).</p>
        <p>In Namakwaland, South Africa, Makubalo and Diamond (2020) reported U concentrations in the range 1.3-5100 μg/L in groundwater from mixed Quaternary alluvium and metamorphic aquifers (most were &lt;400 μg/L). High values were attributed to evaporation and release from secondary U mineralization; groundwater had salinity values up to seawater concentrations. In northern Burundi, groundwater has been found with U up to 734 μg/L. Of 66 groundwater samples analysed, 29% were &gt;30 μg/L (Post et al., 2017). The aquifers were granitic and metamorphic bedrock and weathered granitic sand. Groundwaters had a range of redox conditions, demonstrated by variations in Fe, Mn, NO and NH 4 but the highest U concentrations were present where these were oxic (Post et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>In southern Finland, concentrations up to 3400 μg/L have been found in groundwater from granite (Prat et al., 2009). High concentrations are also found in proximity to the Palmottu U deposit where deposits of uraninite with alteration rims of coffinite occur within micaceous gneiss and granite. Groundwater concentrations in the range 2.2-765 μg/L were found, highest values in oxic groundwater above the ore body, with low values at depths greater than 150 m under reducing conditions (Ahonen et al., 2004). In a deposit from the Helsinki area, concentrations up to 14,870 μg/L were recorded (4.5% of groundwater samples were greater than 1000 μg/L) (Asikainen and Kahlos, 1979).</p>
        <p>Bedrock hosts were granites, amphibolites and migmatites.</p>
        <p>In Norway, concentrations up to 170 μg/L were found in a few samples of groundwater from granite in the Iddefjord, Oslofjord area (Banks et al., 1995). In Switzerland too, highest concentrations (up to μg/L) were found in groundwater associated with granite and gneiss bedrocks (cantons of Valais, Graubünden, Fribourg and Ticino), though here 99.7% of analyses were below 30 μg/L (Stalder et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>In Cyprus, groundwater samples have been found with U concentrations of 0.15-39.1 μg/L in groundwater from ophiolite and from sedimentary rocks (Charalambous et al., 2013). In Britain, concentrations of U are usually low but with a small number of occurrences above 30 μg/L (&lt;0.002-67.2 μg/L; Fig. 5). Highest concentrations are found in oxic zones of red-bed sandstone aquifers of Triassic and Devonian age as well as some Precambrian bedrocks. Relatively low concentrations are found in groundwater from the Variscan granites of south-west England (Shand et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>In Iraq, 0.1-98 μg/L U were found in groundwater from an unconfined Quaternary gypsiferous alluvial fan deposit. U concentrations were lower in deeper groundwaters from an underlying confined aquifer (greater than around 150 m deep). Mobilization of U was linked to carbonate and phosphate complexation under oxic conditions (Alkinani et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>In Egypt, occurrences of a limited extent occur in places linked to U mineralization. Examples with near-neutral pH include El Atshan (U concentration 519 μg/L) and El Allouga mines (U concentration 90-500 μg/L) (Dabous et al., 2002;Ramadan et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>Acid mine drainage with high concentrations of U has also been found to affect some groundwaters. Arnold et al. (2011) reported concentrations up to 69,000 μg/L in mine dripstone waters with pH ca. 2.5 in Königstein, Saxony, Germany. Galhardi and Bonotto (2017) found concentrations of 16.1-2370 μg/L in groundwater in the approximate pH range 3-6 in a coal-mining area of southern Brazil.</p>
        <p>Soil and sediment porewaters commonly have close associations with organic matter, either through complexation in solution or the solid phase (Haas and Northup, 2004;Regenspurg et al., 2010). Porewaters to 20 cm depth in lake sediments from the U-mining-contaminated Bentley and Bow Lakes of Bancroft area, Ontario, Canada, had U concentrations of 10-1300 μg/L and 10-460 μg/L respectively. Porewaters were reducing in both profiles but the U peaks were attributed to complexation with dissolved organic matter (Novotnik et al., 2018). Uranium(VI) in oxic soil porewater (range 0.55-14.3 μg/L) from Broubster, Scotland, was also inferred to be complexed with fulvic acid at pH 5.75-6.48 (Read et al., 1993).</p>
        <p>Soil porewater with U concentrations of 2.4-71 μg/L was reported in Swiss organic-rich wetland soils having U contents up to 4000 mg/kg. The porewater was anoxic; U was present dominantly in the solid phase, partitioned with the solid organic matter (Regenspurg et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>Similarly, Kaplan et al. (2017) found U concentrations of 0.47-59.5 μg/L in soil porewaters from wetlands of Savannah River site, South Carolina, USA. Porewater was mildly acidic (pH 5.2-6.9) and U concentrations were highest in more oxic conditions (Eh &gt; 400 mV). Nonetheless, U as U(VI) partitioned dominantly with the sediment fraction (K d values were 2100-6900 L/kg), mainly bound to organic matter.</p>
        <p>Estuarine porewaters have been found with up to 33.7 μg/L U ( Barnes and Cochran, 1993). In the reducing sediment profile of the Amazon Estuary, Brazil, dissolved concentrations increased in response to release from Fe and Mn oxides undergoing reductive dissolution, below which concentrations diminished as a result of microbially-mediated SO 4 reduction (Barnes and Cochran, 1993). Several other studies have shown depletion of dissolved U in estuarine sediments under Fe-and Mn-reducing conditions, suggesting loss to sediments by reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) and sorption to Fe, Mn oxides and organic matter (Charette and Sholkovitz, 2006;Swarzenski et al., 2004;Windom and Niencheski, 2003).</p>
        <p>In oxic, alkaline conditions (pH 7.2-8.8, HCO 3 49-1010 mg/L), porewaters extracted from loess silty aquifer sediment from La Pampa, Argentina, had U concentrations in the range 0.8-119 μg/L (Smedley et al., 2002). Aqueous U speciation was inferred to be dominated by U-carbonate complexes.</p>
        <p>Uranium mines occur in some 20 countries but the five largest producers: Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, Namibia and Uzbekistan, accounted for 83% of world production in 2018 (NEA and OECD, 2020). During the period 1945-1990, the three principal suppliers were USA, Canada and GDR (East Germany). Demand from the former GDR was largely from the former Soviet Union (Kazakhstan) until GDR mines closed on German reunification and supplies localized to Soviet (Kazaksthan) sources (Wellmer and Scholz, 2017). Traditionally, U mining involved open pit or deep mines but some of the largest producers, especially in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and USA, now use in-situ leaching (ISL) (referred to as in-situ recovery, ISR, in the USA). More than 90% of USA U production and around half of global output derives from ISL (Brown et al., 2016;Mudd, 2014). Sandstone-type roll fronts, which typically have low-grade U (&lt;0.1% U) and a suitable U mineralogy and permeable rock type, are the only ore deposits suitable for U extraction by ISL (Abzalov, 2012). Roll fronts also tend to be contained by confining layers of low hydraulic conductivity, thereby facilitating ISL. A typical ISL site operates for one to three years and recovers about 60-80% of the U. The circulating fluid may be amended with acid (H 2 SO 4 ), alkali (Na 2 CO 3 ) or oxidants (H 2 O 2 ) to enhance leaching. Heap leaching is a variant that may be suitable for smaller sites.</p>
        <p>In principle, ISL can also have the lowest environmental impact (Fig. 6) as U is extracted in aqueous form and so does not involve excavations, tailings piles, ponds or the dispersal of radioactive dust. Nonetheless, it usually involves the injection of substantial quantities of lixiviants, for example sulphuric acid, to mobilize the U (and other trace metals) and uncertainty remains about the effectiveness of postextraction remediation (Schneider et al., 2001).</p>
        <p>Small amounts of U are also produced as a by-product of Cu, Au and P mining (e.g. Durand, 2012) (Section 9.3). As a result of the requirement for production of 235 U exclusively from mined uranium, large quantities of waste 238 U (depleted) are stored worldwide. In this respect, uranium is an unusual waste product.</p>
        <p>The two main uses of U are as a fuel for electricity generation in nuclear power plants and in the production of nuclear weapons. Uranium was also exploited as a colouring agent until the 1940s (Campbell et al., 2015). For the production of U fuel rods, the proportion of 235 U is enriched to around 3-5% to improve the fission process (Mudd, 2014). Depleted U (DU) is a by-product of the nuclear enrichment and nuclear reprocessing industries and is used in armour-piercing munitions and as armoured vehicle cladding. DU munitions have been used in both Gulf Wars and in Serbia, Kosovo and Syria. Experiments on soil columns with buried DU munitions identified corrosion and after 3 years, leaching of up to 0.6% of the corroded DU mass (identified by the 235 U/ 238 U ratio); leaching rates of up to 1 mg/week U to the soil were inferred by the third year (Schimmack et al., 2007). Recently-deposited DU metal has been found to sorb weakly to soil surfaces compared to the natural U and may therefore be relatively mobile (Harguindeguy et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>Uranium is also enriched in fly ash. Dai et al. (2015) reported a range of 135-1890 mg/kg U in Chinese coal ash samples. This can be mobilized in the atmosphere via coal combustion or in some areas may be incorporated into construction materials (Jambhulkar et al., 2018;Papastefanou, 2010). Fallout of fly ash from coal-fired power stations has been detected in shallow soils locally (Papp et al., 2002).</p>
        <p>Animal manure has been found to contain up to around 2.6 mg/kg U (Kratz and Schnug, 2006). In contrast, rock phosphate used in fertilizer production contains up to 245 mg U/kg (Table 9). China is by far the largest phosphate rock processing country in the world, mining more than 48% of global rock phosphate in 2018 (Shang et al., 2021). It is looking to increase domestic U production by using this unconventional resource even though many of the local rock phosphate deposits do not contain large U contents (&lt;30 mg/kg U). Mines in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces are the most promising with up to 480 mg/kg U found in the Leibo deposit in Sichuan (Ye et al., 2019). Morocco is currently the country exporting the largest amount of rock phosphate and also has the largest reserves estimated at 75% of global reserves (Shang et al., 2021). Natural rock phosphate (e.g. Ca fluorapatite) has a low solubility in water and so is processed with strong acids to make a more soluble fertilizer (Hamamo et al., 1995). There are about 400 phosphoric acid plants in operation worldwide producing about 90 million tonnes/yr of which about 85% is used for fertilizers. Processed phosphate fertilizers can contain around 20-500 mg U/kg (average 100 mg/kg) (Taha et al., 2018). A survey of P-fertilizers in Germany found an average of U content of 58 mg/kg (n = 303) (Schnug and Haneklaus, 2015). P-fertilizers can also contain appreciable amounts of other contaminants such as Cd (Kratz et al., 2016), F and Ra. The production of fertilizers from phosphate ore also produces phosphogypsum as a waste by-product. This may be composed of gypsum (CaSO 4 ⋅2H 2 O) or calcium sulphate hemihydrate (CaSO 4 ⋅0.5H 2 O) with admixed sulphuric or phosphoric acid, depending on the raw material and processing method (Rutherford et al., 1994;Saenko et al., 2021). The U content of phosphogypsum also depends on the production process: gypsum production has been shown to result in a U content of some 5-25 mg/kg while the hemihydrate process produces a product with some 5-100 mg/kg (Rutherford et al., 1994). Some countries (e.g. USA) have recovered U from phosphogypsum, and could again, depending on the prevailing economic conditions (Haneklaus et al., 2017;Steiner et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Although phosphate fertilizers and their by-products provide a measurable input of anthropogenic U to the environment, the magnitude of their overall impact is unclear. The degree of fertilizer U retention in soils depends on the texture, mineralogy, and especially on the organic matter and clay content (Rothbaum et al., 1979) but, in general, it can be expected to be high. However, some studies have found U not to accumulate significantly in fertilized agricultural soils. Hamamo et al. (1995) found little difference between long-term fertilized soils and unfertilized soils in Illinois, USA (range 4.2-4.9 mg/kg). Others have demonstrated a difference. Unfertilized soils in the UK showed slightly smaller U contents than fertilized soils, with ranges of 2.33-2.52 mg/kg (mean 2.44 mg/kg) and 2.25-3.11 mg/kg (mean 2.88 mg/kg), respectively (Rothbaum et al., 1979). Zielinski et al. (2006) studied phosphate-fertilized pastureland in Florida, USA and found slightly higher U contents in soils in the top 15 cm than in deeper soils, and also compared with local native pasture (Table 6). In addition, 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios were distinct, being close to 1.0 ± 0.05 values in shallow soil extracts suggestive of a fertilizer signature (Zielinski et al., 2000), compared to higher activity ratios (mostly &gt;1.1) in extracts from greater than 15 cm deep and in native soils. Soil U content also correlated well with P content. Nonetheless, all soil U contents were small at less than 1.4 mg/kg and a simple mass balance suggests that the increase in total soil U would in any case be undetectably small. A similar conclusion was reached by Liesch et al. (2015) but they nevertheless found a small increase in median U concentrations in groundwaters when comparing agricultural (0.9 μg/L) to non-agricultural (0.7 μg/L) areas in Germany, a finding that may or may not be related to the use of P fertilizers. Other studies have also demonstrated increased concentrations of U in surface water, agricultural drainage and shallow groundwater, and have implicated phosphate fertilizers (Barišić et al., 1992;Lyons et al., 2020;Schnug and Lottermoser, 2013). Changes in U concentrations in drainage waters are more sensitive to fertilizer inputs than changes in total soil contents.</p>
        <p>Increases in U concentrations in surface waters downstream from P fertilizer factories have been observed in Sichuan, China (Wang et al., 2019) and southern Spain (Martinez-Aguirre et al., 1994) but the increases are also generally small in comparison with the natural variation and are not sufficient to lead to exceedances of the drinking-water guideline values.</p>
        <p>Numerous U contaminated sites have been the subject of extensive research and remediation over several decades (Dinis and Fiúza, 2021;Gavrilescu et al., 2009). Examples of well-documented sites include US Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford site, Washington; DOE Rifle site, Colorado; DOE Savannah River site, South Carolina; Monticello Superfund site, Utah; Oak Ridge processing facility, Tennessee and numerous former mine sites. Methods of remediation of U contaminated land have been reviewed extensively by Campbell et al. (2015). Traditional remediation methods include excavation and disposal and pump-and-treat, but potentially less expensive and less disruptive alternatives include in-situ barriers and in-situ treatments. These include physical barriers, reactive barriers, U mineral precipitation, sorption to organic matter or metal oxides, co-precipitation with metal oxides, microbial remediation and substitution in silicates and carbonates (Duff et al., 2002). Physical covers designed to prevent water infiltration and release of Rn gas may be used. A barrier involving layers of earth, geotextile membrane and liner has been used at the Monticello site (Campbell et al., 2015). Permeable reactive barriers investigated for U remediation include zero-valent iron (ZVI) (Fiedor et al., 1998;Morrison et al., 2002), phosphate (Arey et al., 1999;Pan et al., 2016;Simon et al., 2008) and Fe(III) (Duff et al., 2002). These barrier methods typically have a high U removal efficiency, albeit concerns include reduced aquifer permeability following precipitation of Fe(III) oxides and the potential for subsequent U remobilization.</p>
        <p>Reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) for incorporation into a low-solubility U (IV) mineral can involve either natural attenuation or amendments using abiotic reductants, e.g. sulphide compounds, or electron donors for biotic processes. Experiments at the Rifle field site, Colorado, involved addition of acetate and resulted in removal of U(VI) through initial Fe reduction involving Geobacteracea, with subsequent SO 4 reduction achieved by Desulfobacteraceae (Williams et al., 2011). Simultaneous addition of acetate and Fe(III) was found the be a promising approach (Zhuang et al., 2012). Again, concerns include aquifer clogging by reaction products and biomass and the long-term stability of the reduced forms (Campbell et al., 2015). Laboratory experiments have investigated use of amorphous FeS (Hua and Deng, 2008) and H 2 S (Hua et al., 2006) as abiotic reductants. Experiments at the DOE Hanford site have shown that phosphate addition is a promising remediation amendment (Knox et al., 2008;Wang et al., 2017). Natural attenuation has been tried at numerous sites, including Hanford and Rifle, though the results have commonly proven disappointing (Maher et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>Constructed wetlands have also been employed in U remediation for sites with low to moderate contamination. These can alter the ambient pH and redox conditions with assistance from microbes and wetland plant species. The approach has been tried successfully in experimental studies with Phragmites, Typha and Carex riparia (Groza et al., 2010), and operationally at Ranger mine, Australia using Eleocharis (spike rush) and Nymphaea sp. (water lilies) (Ring et al., 2004) and with varying success, at the WISMUT Pöhla site, Germany using 'Aquamats' and reactive filters (Kunze et al., 2007). Physical and chemical treatment plants can be added inline to boost remediation effectiveness (Campbell et al., 2015) and to provide a backup in case of fluctuations outside of the regulatory tolerances (Kunze et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>Uranium mining and waste site remediation depends on local aqueous and solid conditions and effective methods differ according to local site conditions. Remediation of U typically also requires remediation of associated radionuclides, e.g. 226 Ra, and non-radioactive solutes such as As, Ni, V, Mo, F, SO 4 and NO 3 , which often require differing remediation strategies. One approach being explored for old tailings sites as well as the Fukushima nuclear accident site is the use of geopolymers to solidify the toxic material and thereby reduce the leakage of radioactivity. Geopolymers are synthetic cement-like materials that can offer improved physical and chemical characteristics over ordinary Portland cement for the long-term immobilization of a wide range of radioactive elements including U. They also offer a low carbon footprint compared to conventional Portland cements. One such geopolymer is made from calcined kaolinite ('metakaolin') treated with phosphoric acid (T. Zhao et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>The recent widespread use of horizontal drilling and high-volume hydraulic fracturing ('fracking') to exploit unconventional hydrocarbon reserves in U-rich marine black shales has led to concerns over the unintentional release of naturally-occurring radioactive materials (NORM) associated with the flowback and produced fluids. Radium has received the most attention but U has also been of potential concern. Fortunately the strongly-reducing nature of many of these reserves means that U mobility is severely restricted and that U does not reach detrimental concentrations (Nelson et al., 2015). Mining for U, REE and P can also lead to possibly high exposures of NORM.</p>
        <p>The three natural U isotopes, 238 U, 235 U and 234 U, have long halflives of 4.47 × 10 9 years, 7.04 × 10 8 years and 2.46 × 10 5 years respectively. The 238 U and 235 U isotopes are each parents in two separate decay chains, and the 234 U isotope is a daughter in the 238 U series (Vengosh et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>A 234 U/ 238 U activity ratio, AR, of 1.0 indicates a condition of secular equilibrium. This occurs in a closed system or where conditions are geochemically undisturbed for at least 1 Ma according to the nuclides' respective half-lives (Andrews et al., 1989). In secular equilibrium, the daughter 234 U decays at the same rate as the 238 U parent and the rate of production of 234 U will be equal to its rate of decay (i.e. the activity of 238 U is equal to the activity of 234 U). 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios other than 1 indicate conditions out of secular equilibrium.</p>
        <p>The radioactive decay of the 238 U isotope to 234 U, via the short-lived 234 Th (half-life 24.1 days) and 234 Pa (6.74 hours), involves in turn the emission of one alpha particle and two beta particles. In minerals, this causes damage to the crystal structure. The 234 U atom recoils as a result of the energy produced by alpha decay and this may translocate the atom to a different position in the crystal structure or eject it completely from the mineral into solution. The distance translocated can be 30-40 nm in silicate minerals (Brown et al., 2016). The intermediate 234 Th atom can etch a track in the crystal and increase the leaching potential in the zone of the track (Fleischer, 1982;Fleischer et al., 1972). Daughter 234 U is thereby more easily leached. Moreover, the ionizing alpha particle released from 234 U can also attract two valence electrons from the parent to balance its 2+ charge (producing a helium atom), leaving the daughter 234 Th with two fewer valence electrons. As a result, the 234 U atom produced will be hexavalent rather than tetravalent, with consequent increased mobility (Andrews et al., 1989). The total activity of 234 U in the system will be composed of the component supported by secular equilibrium and the recoil-derived excess which will decay over time. Both 235 U and 238 U are bound strongly to the crystal structure relative to 234 U (Stirling et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>Excesses of 234 U in water can therefore be attributed to alpha-recoilrelated release and selective leaching (Andrews et al., 1989;Porcelli and Swarzenski, 2003). The variation in the 234 U/ 238 U ratio can be a useful indicator of hydrological and geochemical processes including as a tracer of groundwater provenance and an indicator of mixing, weathering, groundwater/surface-water interactions, redox processes and pollution (Brown et al., 2016;Riotte and Chabaux, 1999;Zielinski et al., 2000).</p>
        <p>The 234 U/ 238 U activity ratio is constant in the open ocean at 1.14 (Anderson et al., 1989;Swarzenski et al., 2004). In more restricted marine conditions, ratios can vary according to river and groundwater inputs and redox transformations (Anderson et al., 1989). In surface water, 234 U/ 238 U is usually &gt;1: the average ratio of the riverine flux to the oceans is 1.25 (Henderson and Anderson, 2003).</p>
        <p>The ratios in groundwater are also commonly &gt;1 (Cowart and Osmond, 1980;Coyte et al., 2018;Porcelli and Swarzenski, 2003;Priestley et al., 2018). Groundwater ratios from deep aquifers may be much higher (Andrews et al., 1989). 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios vary as a function of redox conditions and groundwater residence time (Lee et al., 2001). In oxic conditions, relatively high dissolved U concentrations can potentially exist, with secular equilibrium values of 234 U/ 238 U. Under reducing conditions, release of 234 U via alpha recoil is favoured, thereby increasing the 234 U/ 238 U ratio in the groundwater (Osmond et al., 1983). In addition, if groundwater residence time is extended, recoil-generated 234 U can increase, leaving an increased 234 U/ 238 U activity ratio. An activity ratio of &lt;1 is uncommon in groundwater except near ore bodies (Yanase et al., 1995). This may result from 234 U losses from a weathered mineral, with subsequent mineral weathering reducing the ratio in solution (Porcelli and Swarzenski, 2003;Yanase et al., 1995)</p>
        <p>Variations in the 238 U/ 235 U ratio can also be of help in understanding geochemical processes in aqueous systems. The isotopic composition may be expressed in absolute ratios as 238 U/ 235 U or as a relative per mil deviation, δ 238 U. The different half-lives of 238 U and 235 U have resulted in the 238 U/ 235 U ratio changing over geological time from around 3 to around 138 over the 4.5 × 10 9 years of earth history (Andersen et al., 2017). Fractionation of the isotopes occurs via non-radioactive physico-chemical processes in low-temperature environments, principally associated with microbially-mediated reduction of U(VI) to U(IV), with overall preferential reduction of 238 U relative to 235 U (Stirling et al., 2015). Microbially-driven redox changes have been shown to fractionate the ratio by some 1‰ or more (Stylo et al., 2015). Wang et al. (2015) found U(IV) to be around 1.6‰ heavier than U(VI) from experiments with the species in aqueous form (in acidic conditions). Preferential removal of 238 U in the solid phase as U(IV) leaves a U(VI) residual solution that becomes isotopically lighter, in a Raleigh-type distillation process. Abiotic reduction has shown less evidence of fractionation, or a slight increase in the lighter isotope in the reduced U(IV) form (Andersen et al., 2017). Natural 238 U/ 235 U fractionation is limited without redox changes. The ratio is not strongly fractionated by sorption reactions (Brown et al., 2016). Sorption of U(VI) to birnessite has shown only a small, approximately 0.2‰, reduction in 238 U/ 235 U ratio in the sorbed U compared to the aqueous U (Brennecka et al., 2011). Similarly, no 238 U/ 235 U isotopic fractionation was observed in desorption experiments with unconfined Quaternary floodplain sediments from Rifle, Colorado (Shiel et al., 2013). Some small fractionation may occur through preferential leaching of U-rich minerals (Murphy et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>The dominant role of the U(IV)/U(VI) transformation, both oxidation and reduction, as the driver for changes in the 235 U/ 238 U ratio has led to its use as a redox proxy: a recorder of past changes in redox conditions, and implicitly in the organic-richness of palaeo-environments (Abshire et al., 2022;Andersen et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2021;Lau et al., 2019;Weyer et al., 2008). Recent applications have addressed the timings of ocean anoxic events (OAEs) (Clarkson et al., 2018;McDonald et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>Although minute quantities of 236 U occur naturally, 236 U is a constituent of spent nuclear fuel and its presence in environmental samples is an indicator of anthropogenic U. It has been detected widely in small amounts but not sufficient to seriously disrupt natural ratios, except potentially locally around nuclear power plants and weapons sites (Andersen et al., 2017). Naturally-occurring U ores have 236 U/ 238 U atom ratios &lt;10 -9 (Murphy et al., 2015). The presence of 236 U/ 238 U ratios above this may indicate local inputs of anthropogenic U from spent fuel.</p>
        <p>The spatial distributions of U described above ultimately arise from the operation of chemical processes at the atomic scale and over varying time scales, often under the influence of fluid flow, principally of water. The principal processes involved are surprisingly similar in the various environments. Given the importance of U to the nuclear industry and the environment, its chemistry has been studied extensively and documented in many settings, as the studies referenced above indicate. A large body of information has accumulated aided by the ever-increasing scope of sophisticated analytical measurements, databasing and modelling. The aim is to understand reasons for the distributions observed and ideally, to be able to predict future changes, including under changing environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>The two principal oxidation states -U(VI) and U(IV) -are found in oxidizing and reducing conditions, respectively. The uranyl ion, UO 2 2+ , is the stable species of U(VI) in oxidized environments. The two strongly-bound O atoms present in the UO 2 2+ ion are arranged in an axial (vertical) orientation with 5-8 H 2 O molecules attached in the equatorial plane (Kubicki et al., 2009;Müller et al., 2019). Grenthe et al. (2021) favour the structure with five water molecules as this is supported by EXAFS data and quantum chemical calculations. The U 4+ cation is only stable under strongly reducing conditions with the central cation surrounded by 9 ± 1 water molecules, a conclusion also supported by EXAFS data and quantum chemical calculations (Grenthe et al., 2021;Shor et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Both these cationic species are very susceptible to hydrolysis (loss of protons from bound water molecules) and are only found in extremely acidic solutions. More commonly, they are found in their hydrolyzed forms or complexed with other ligands, especially oxygen-containing ligands such as carbonate, phosphate and silicate as well as a broad range of organic ligands, large and small. Ternary complexes such as Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 also form and are very stable (Kubicki et al., 2009;Oher et al., 2020;Shang et al., 2020;Shang and Reiller, 2020). At high U concentrations, this tendency to hydrolyze can lead to polynuclear species, colloids and ultimately, well-defined and rather insoluble minerals such as schoepite or metaschoepite. Most of the ligands that U binds strongly to in solution can also form corresponding U minerals and it is this duality in the role of ligands that adds to the complexity of U chemistry.</p>
        <p>The U(V) oxidation state is transient but the UO 2 + aquo ion has been identified in the laboratory and can be stabilized by various organic ligands and concentrated carbonate solutions (Mizuoka et al., 2005). It has five water molecules in its first coordination sphere. The water molecules are strongly polarized, leading to a particularly strong tendency to hydrolyze (Atta-Fynn et al., 2012;Grenthe et al., 2021). U(V) occurs naturally but rapidly disproportionates to U(IV) or U(VI) and so is now considered unstable and rare. This contrasts with Langmuir's (1978) assertion that it 'has an appreciable field of stability in reduced waters below pH 7'. Uranium(V) can be stabilized briefly by complexation. The UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 5-species has been found to be stable for 2 h in aqueous solutions and for up to 2 weeks when sealed in a cuvette (Kubicki et al., 2009). U(V) species may also be important intermediaries in the reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) by microbes. The Fe (III)-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR1 has been shown to produce U(V) stabilized for up to 120 h (Vettese et al., 2020). U(V) species may also appear as transient species during the reduction of U (VI)-Ca-CO 3 complexes by zero-valent iron (Tsarev et al., 2017). These considerations notwithstanding, the redox chemistry of U in the environment is overwhelmingly about the interplay of the U(IV) and U(VI) oxidation states.</p>
        <p>Thermodynamic databases encapsulate in a quantitative way the chemical reactions that give rise to the varied suite of U-containing gaseous, solution, mineral and surface species that define the behaviour of U in the environment. Together with the appropriate speciation software, they enable predictions about the behaviour of U to be made for a wide variety of environments: natural, laboratory and industrial. We summarize some of the more important publicly-available databases suitable for environmental applications in Table 10 and provide some idea of the scope of the databases by tabulating the total number of species and number of U species included in each database.</p>
        <p>The chemistry of U is particularly complex and thermodynamic data have been derived from a large number of detailed laboratory studies over many years. One of the first systematic compilations for U was by Langmuir (1978). The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) Thermochemical Database (TDB) is now the most comprehensive source of critically-reviewed thermodynamic data (Martinez et al., 2019;Ragoussi and Costa, 2019). This project has reviewed data for U and associated elements on a rolling basis since 1986. The reviews by Grenthe et al. (1992) and Guillaumont et al. (2003) were pivotal in defining the stability of many of the key U species, and the most recent review published in 2021 (Grenthe et al., 2021) has updated these. The electronic database derived from the latest work, the TDB-e database, is based on selected data that are deemed to be highly reliable and well-documented and is deliberately conservative. Therefore, while it provides an excellent foundation, the TDB-e database is notably incomplete (Mühr-Ebert et al., 2019) and often needs to be supplemented to make it suitable for environmental applications. Fortunately, this has been done by others, most recently with the PRODATA database (Reiller and Descostes, 2020) which has been developed specifically for mining applications but should nevertheless have a wider role in environmental studies.</p>
        <p>Other modern databases extending the 'official' NEA TDB-e database include those from the ThermoChimie, NAGRA/PSI, JAEA TDB and THEREDA projects (Table 10). There are other more specialized databases such as SOLTHERM for geothermal systems (Alsemgeest et al., 2021), ColdChem (Pitzer) for low temperatures (Toner et al., 2017), CEMDATA for cements (Lothenbach et al., 2019) and phreeqc.dat for gases (Peng-Robinson) (Appelo et al., 2014;Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013). However, none of these databases includes U species. The program 
            <rs type="software">SUPPHREEQC</rs> has also been developed for generating customized PHREEQC-format databases for high temperatures and pressures from the SUPCRTBL database (G. Zhang et al., 2020).
        </p>
        <p>The PHREEQC-format electronic databases cited above do not include the uncertainties in their data although this could in principle be added as comments. However, none of the popular speciation programs would be able to use these data directly to propagate errors. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations would certainly be feasible and the program 
            <rs type="software">MCPhreeqc</rs> (AMPHOS21, 2011) has been designed to do just this. Alternatively, the 
            <rs type="software">PhreeqcRM</rs> interface to 
            <rs type="software">PHREEQC</rs> (Parkhurst and Wissmeier, 2015) would be ideal for developing customized MC software. Although uncertainty data are not included in the electronic databases, some of the supporting information for the databases does provide this. The NEA-TDB (Grenthe et al., 2021) is notable in this respect.
        </p>
        <p>Some databases maintain an internal consistency: true 'databases' in the sense defined by Hörbrand et al. (2018), while others do not. Overall, the published electronic databases show a somewhat confusing mixture of common and unique data with differing quality standards for inclusion (Lu et al., 2022;Meeussen et al., 2009;Reiller and Descostes, 2020;Wang et al., 2019). Some of these databases are open-source, some proprietary, some actively maintained, others not. Most can in principle be modified or extended to include new data. The original databases are closely linked to the software that uses them but the 
            <rs type="software">PHREEQC</rs> format has become the de facto interchange format; all the databases in Table are available in this format and can be used with the popular 
            <rs type="software">PHREEQC</rs> software (Lu et al., 2022;Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013). Depending on the database used, 
            <rs type="software">PHREEQC</rs> can use the ion-association (extended Debye-Hückel, B-dot or Davies equations), Pitzer or SIT (Specific Ion Interaction Theory) models to account for non-idealities in solution (the variation of activity coefficients), and either an enthalpy or a polynomial expression to account for the temperature dependency of log K's.
        </p>
        <p>The llnl.dat database, which was compiled by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, uses an extended Debye-Hückel model with the B-dot extension, as well as a detailed model for the activity coefficient of CO 2 (aq). The database has been designed specifically to cover a wide range of temperatures and ionic strengths (including seawater). Other approaches designed for medium to high ionic strengths are the Pitzer approach (up to 6 mol/kg water) and the SIT approach (up to mol/kg water). The SIT approach is favoured by the NEA TDB and its siblings. The Pitzer and SIT approaches use semi-empirical corrections to the Debye-Hückel equation through a set of specific ion-ion interaction parameters between pairs or triplets of ions. The Pitzer approach attempts to maintain internal consistency and replaces many of the weak complexes between major ions seen in the other databases with a set of interaction parameters. However, in most cases these parameters are only known for a relatively small subset of major-ion species. The THEREDA database is the most complete Pitzer database and includes parameters for a relatively large number of major ion-U interactions.</p>
        <p>For users not closely associated with a specific database, it can be difficult to know which database is best to use for calculations. The first consideration is matching the suite of elements and species of interest to those in the available databases. The second consideration is the appropriate choice of activity model based on the ionic strength of interest as outlined above. Additional factors include the perceived quality of the database, its completeness and transparency. Detailed comparisons between databases are non-trivial because of the lack of use of established conventions for the naming of species, e.g. IUPAC or CODATA for chemical species and IMA/CNMNC for mineral names (Warr, 2021). Solution species are defined by their chemical formulae but the order of components (e.g. elements), their grouping and the use of parentheses is variable, e.g. Si(OH) 4 or H 4 SiO 4 . The same mineral may be spelt or labelled differently and may be specified by a chemical formula or a mineral name. A given mineral may actually refer to different polymorphs (e.g. alpha or beta forms) which can have notably different properties, e.g. amorphous or crystalline. Mineral formulae can sometimes even be mistaken for solution species. Uranium suffers from these inconsistencies more than most elements because of the large number of species and minerals involved. The lack of canonical naming means that a simple lexicographic comparison of species by name is not possible and that switching or merging of databases can require significant changes to scripts.</p>
        <p>There have been attempts to include sorption processes in generic databases but the task is daunting and progress has been rather slow (Brendler et al., 2003;Jung et al., 2001;McKinley and Scholits, 1993;Payne et al., 2011; van der Lee and Lomenech, 2004). Notable achievements include the SDB by the Japanese Atomic Energy Agency, JAEA (Sugiura et al., 2020) and the RES 3 T (Rossendorf Expert System for Surface and Sorption Thermodynamics). As with minerals, there is no uniformity in the naming of surface species. In 2011, the JAEA database (Version 3) included 46,669 K d values of which some 4231 were for U on non-cementitious substrates. By 2017, this had increased to 62,977 K d 's. However, K d values are highly conditional not only on the substrate, e.g. its specific surface area (Mendez et al., 2020;Payne et al., 2011), but also on the solution composition (e.g. pH, PCO 2 , redox, ionic strength, etc.) which makes estimating K d 's for varying conditions, as required in many simulations, difficult.</p>
        <p>The RES 3 T system adopts a more fundamental approach in that it concentrates on surface complexation data for pure minerals rather than whole soils and sediments. It is being actively maintained and as of 15 May 2022 has data for 150 minerals and 7448 surface-complexation reactions including many for U. This provides the prospect of modelling the behaviour of U in a wide variety of soils and sediments using a linear additive approach but leaves unresolved the challenge of identifying the quantities and detailed properties of the model components present in the system of interest (Davis et al., 2004). There are presently no data for metal-ion binding to humics in the database. At a more fundamental level, there can be significant interactions amongst the components leading to non-additive behaviour and kinetic effects (Reiller, 2012;Weng et al., 2008a). Ternary (mineral-humic-metal) interactions are likely to be significant in many environmental settings which has led to various modelling approaches (Bryan et al., 2012), although none specifically targeting U speciation. Since the derivation of surface-complexation parameters inevitably involves a detailed solution speciation, e.g. for calculating the activity of the uranyl ion, maintaining consistency between the sorption and aqueous databases requires</p>
        <p>Dzombak &amp; Morel surface species a Count of species defined by species type: aq = aqueous; min = mineral; gas and ads = adsorbed species. "Minimum solubility" is the concentration of U in a strongly reducing system expressed as log 10 (dissolved U in mol/kgw): U T = 1e-3 mol/kgw, NaCl = 1e-2 mol/kgw, 20 • C, pH 7, PO 2 (g) = -70 atm.</p>
        <p>special care and could, in principle, necessitate a reanalysis of the original sorption data.</p>
        <p>As the scope of quantum chemical modelling increases, especially of DFT, it is likely that these methods will provide increased support for the choice of the most stable species and ultimately, the derivation of log K's and other thermodynamic properties of solution, mineral and surface species, parameters that are often difficult or impossible to measure experimentally. Recent work deriving thermodynamic properties of some uranyl-phosphate aqueous species (Jackson et al., 2013) and uranyl-carbonate minerals (Colmenero, 2020) are examples. Similar calculations have already been used to help constrain the choice of surface species (Hiemstra, 2018;D. Pan et al., 2022) and to design novel uranium adsorbents (W.-W. Zhao et al., 2022). These methods are particularly useful when combined with spectroscopic techniques such as attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR IR), EXAFS and XANES, which can help to corroborate the derived molecular structures.</p>
        <p>In oxidizing waters, the uranyl ion, UO 2 2+ , is dominant but as noted above, this readily hydrolyzes and forms a large set of unusually strong complexes with a wide variety of common ligands (Grenthe et al., 2021;Langmuir, 1978). These include OH -, CO 3 2-, PO 4 3-, SiO 4 2-, F -, Na + , Ca 2+</p>
        <p>and Mg 2+ . U(VI) and U(IV) chloride complexes can even be formed under extreme conditions (Hennig et al., 2005;Timofeev et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>The speciation embedded within a thermodynamic database is often best-illustrated in terms of species-pH plots and Eh-pH predominance diagrams. All calculations here and in the rest of this review were made with

            <rs type="software">PhreePlot</rs> (Kinniburgh and Cooper, 2004). We have primarily used the PRODATA database as this is a modern database that extends the NEA TDB-e with species that are of potential environmental significance. Reiller and Descostes (2020) give a detailed discussion of the development of this database, its relationship with other databases and how they resolved issues of internal consistency. Fig. 7(a,b) shows a species-pH plot for U (10 -6 mol/kg water or 2.4 μg/L) in oxidizing and reducing freshwaters respectively, containing the major ligand-forming elements with a Mg/Ca molar ratio of 1 and exposed to atmospheric CO 2 . In Fig. 7(a), three uranyl-carbonate complexes dominate the U speciation above pH 6 and above pH 7.5, two U-Ca-CO 3 ternary complexes are dominant. Even below pH 7.5, uranyl complexes with P and F are more dominant than the bare UO 2 2+ ion.
        </p>
        <p>The redox conditions imposed for the reducing case (Fig. 7(b)), namely a fixed O 2 (g) partial pressure of 10 -70 atm, are sufficient to reduce U(VI) to U(IV) below pH 8 but not to reduce CO 2 (g) to CH 4 (g). Above pH 8, U(VI) becomes increasingly important and the ternary U-Ca(Mg)-CO 3 complexes dominate in both oxidizing and moderately reducing freshwaters up to about pH 9.5, after which UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 4-becomes dominant. In even more reducing waters, CO 2 (g) is reduced to CH 4 (g) and the U-CO 3 complexes become insignificant. Speciation of seawater-like solutions (Fig. 7(c)) over the pH range pH 8-9.5 is broadly similar to the oxidizing freshwater case described above but with the U-Mg-CO 3 ternary complex playing a more important role. At the natural seawater pH of 8.1, according to this speciation, U speciation in seawater is dominated by a mixture of the charged species MgUO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 2-, CaUO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 2-, UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 4-and the neutral species, Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 . This speciation is similar to that shown in Shang and Reiller (2020) except that the MgUO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 species is included here following the most recent update to the PRODATA database. Bernhard et al. (2001), Vercouter et al. (2015) and Reiller and Descostes (2020) have stressed the importance of these ternary complexes in environmental applications, especially where the dissolved organic carbon concentration is low. Jo et al. (2022) provide a recent review of the stability of all the major (Mg, Ca, Se, Ba) ternary alkaline earth-U-CO 3 species. There is still some uncertainty about the relative abundance of these species with some speciation calculations for seawater showing Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 as the dominant species (Endrizzi et al., 2016;Endrizzi and Rao, 2014;Li et al., 2017;Wu et al., 2016). It is also known that Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 forms a strong association with Na + in solution, effectively making quaternary species possible (Li et al., 2017;Wu et al., 2016). In summary, while the importance of uranyl carbonate species has been appreciated for a long time (Langmuir, 1978;Hostetler and Garrels, 1962), it is only relatively recently that stability constants for all the commonly-found Ca-Mg ternary complexes have become available (Grenthe et al., 2021;Jo et al., 2019;Mühr-Ebert et al., 2019;Shang and Reiller, 2020), and even now some uncertainty remains. Note that given the strength of U-CO 3 interactions, U-CO 3 species can be significant under neutral and even mildly acidic conditions which highlights their importance not only in the environment but also in laboratory experiments carried out under open-atmosphere conditions.</p>
        <p>Below pH 6-7, the CO 3 2-activity diminishes rapidly and other ligands such as OH -, PO 4 3-, SiO 4 2-, SO 4 2-and even F -, if present, combine with the uranyl ion. The bare uranyl ion, UO 2</p>
        <p>, therefore only becomes significant below pH 7, or at even lower pH values, when the concentrations of these ligand-forming anions are low. Uranyl phosphate species do not appear in these diagrams but where P is enhanced due to pollution, mining or natural mineralization, soluble P species can become important especially below pH 7 (Wang et al., 2019). Uranium can also be precipitated as U-phosphate solids under aerobic P-rich conditions with a high U loading. This can also occur via the bioprecipitation of U-P minerals mediated by various organisms which secrete extracellular acid and alkaline phosphatases (Kulkarni et al., 2013(Kulkarni et al., , 2016;;Nilgiriwala et al., 2008).</p>
        <p>Uranyl sulphate species can be significant in acidic sulphate-rich natural waters such as those arising from acid mine drainage (Arnold et al., 2011;Ladeira and Gonçalves, 2007). At higher U concentrations, polynuclear species such as (UO 2 ) 2 CO 3 (OH) 3 -can play a significant role especially above pH 6, a feature that may be important in experimental studies. Other complexing ligands such as EDTA may be relevant at contaminated sites.</p>
        <p>Eh-pH diagrams are used to show the impact of varying redox potential (Eh) and pH on U speciation and incidentally provide a useful way to compare databases. Diagrams based on the 12 databases included in Table 10 are shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(a) shows the predominant species for a simple U-C-Na-Cl system where the precipitation of all minerals has been suppressed, while in Fig. 8(b), the same systems are considered but all minerals that show supersaturation are allowed to precipitate. The upper boundary of these diagrams shows where the oxygen fugacity is above atmospheric (0.21 atm) and the lower boundary is for an oxygen fugacity of 10 -70 atm, below which the methane partial pressures can become very large. Trying to maintain a fixed PCO 2 above pH 10 leads to high carbonate concentrations.</p>
        <p>Although the calculated aqueous speciation varies considerably in detail between the various databases (Fig. 8(a)), the major features are common to all databases, namely in oxidizing waters (Eh &gt; ca. 0.5 V): (i) UO 2 2+ dominates from pH 3-6; (ii) above pH 9, the carbonate species, UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 4-, dominates, and (iii) between pH 6-9, the speciation is much more variable with a variety of hydrolyzed uranyl and carbonate species predominating. The speciation under reducing conditions is quite variable. The databases show UO 2 + and U(OH) 4 dominating under most pH conditions but some databases, notably Minteq and its derivatives, include U(OH) 5 -at high pH. Uranyl carbonate species dominate the speciation at higher pH's. If Ca and Mg had been present in these simulations, the ternary species would likely be present as indicated in Fig. 8. Reduction of U(VI) generally occurs over the Eh range +0.25V to -0.2V which straddles the suboxic-anoxic boundary (Borch et al., 2010) and is similar to the active redox zones of As and V. In an increasingly reducing environment, U(VI) reduction occurs just after Fe 3+ reduction but before SO 4 2-reduction. A more complete redox sequence is:</p>
        <p>with the precise order depending on the redox reaction considered and the extent of mineral precipitation. All such considerations take place against the background that most redox reactions are kinetically-controlled and that thermodynamic equilibrium between redox species is often not attained.</p>
        <p>All the databases show supersaturation with one or more minerals under strongly reducing conditions at ambient temperatures (ca. pe + pH &lt; 7 or 17*Eh + pH &lt; 7) even, as here, where the total U concentration is only 10 -6 mol/kg water (Fig. 8(b)). The supersaturated minerals are either uraninite (UO 2 (cr)), or in the case of the NEA TDB-e and THEREDA databases, the more soluble 'amorphous' form, U(OH) 4 (am). The amorphous form may be a nano-particulate version of uraninite or closer to the poorly-defined 'non-crystalline' U(IV) precipitates generated by microbes (Alessi et al., 2014b). EXAFS shows that these non-crystalline forms do not have the U-U pair correlations at ca. 3.8-3.9 Å characteristic of UO 2 (cr), perhaps due to co-precipitated impurities such as P or Fe (Alessi et al., 2014a(Alessi et al., , 2014b)). The ratio of uraninite to non-crystalline UO 2 formed depends on the other ions present during formation: low concentrations of U plus environmentally-relevant concentrations of sulphate, silicate and phosphate favour the formation of non-crystalline UO 2 (Stylo et al., 2013). U(OH) 4 (am) can also be produced by the rapid reduction of U(VI) in the laboratory but care has to be taken during solubility measurements to avoid any partial oxidation to U(VI) since this can lead to anomalously high estimates of U(IV) solubility (Rai et al., 1990). Because of the generally slow kinetics of uraninite dissolution and precipitation in the natural environment, it is usually considered inappropriate to use solubility data for crystalline uraninite, UO 2 (cr) in modelling; some amorphous form is preferred (Alessi et al., 2014b;Richter et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>Three of the databases (PRODATA, ThermoChimie and THEREDA) include Na-UO 2 minerals, namely Na-compreignacite or clarkeite, which can also precipitate under oxidizing conditions. With higher U concentrations, aqueous polynuclear uranyl species become important and more minerals begin to precipitate across the whole range of Eh. This includes schoepite under oxidizing conditions and a range of mixedvalence U oxide minerals such as UO 2.34 (s) and UO 2.67 (s) as the environment becomes increasingly reducing. As the complexity of the water chemistry increases, so the number of possible solution and mineral species increases rapidly.</p>
        <p>The propensity of U to precipitate as a wide variety of highly insoluble solids is well known and is widely used in the extraction and purification of U for industrial use. As outlined above, this can occur even with micromolar concentrations of U and major ions. Uranium can also bind to a wide variety of mineral surfaces. Given the high ratio of minerals/U found in sediments and soils, these reactions can dominate U behaviour. These interactions may simply involve U binding to the surface of minerals (sorption; Payne and Waite, 2022), or more complex interactions involving incorporation into the subsurface structure ending up as a solid solution or co-precipitate, or even being intimately bound to an organic component. Chemical analyses show that many minerals contain minor amounts of U (Table 5).</p>
        <p>Unlike the 'on-off' nature of mineral precipitation, sorption reactions occur on most surfaces to some extent, the overall amount depending on the surface area involved (Mendez et al., 2020) and the strength of the interaction. These reactions can be highly selective and so are particularly important for trace metals such as U. This highly selective sorption contrasts with the rather non-specific binding by cation exchange as seen on the basal planes of permanently-charged phyllosilicate clays. These cation exchange reactions are important for the major elements, Ca, Mg, Na and K but much less so for trace elements such as U. Sorption reactions are normally rapid, occurring in minutes to hours, and reversible, whereas the kinetics of mineral precipitation/dissolution and solid solution reactions are much more variable and are likely to depend strongly on particle size, structural features and environmental factors. Such differences can provide an empirical basis for speciating trace metals in soils and sediments based on their selective dissolution in various reagents, e.g. the three-step BCR procedure (Dhoum and Evans, 1998). A bicarbonate-based extraction procedure seems particularly appropriate for determining sorbed U in oxidized sediments (Seder--Colomina et al., 2018;Stoliker et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>The speciation of U in reduced sediments is more problematic and may benefit from a strong anion exchange resin to separate dissolved U (VI) and U(IV) (Stoliker et al., 2013) or an anaerobic 1.0 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.7) extraction to separate biogenically-produced non-crystalline UO 2 from crystalline uraninite (Alessi et al., 2012;Cerrato et al., 2013). The inclusion of an oxidant such as potassium persulphate can also help to resolve the solid forms based on the kinetics of oxidative Fig. 8. Eh-pH predominance diagrams for U calculated using the 12 databases tabulated in Table 10. These diagrams are for relatively simple systems with a total U concentration of 10 -6 mol/kg water in 0.01 mol NaCl/kg water and under a fixed PCO 2 of 10 -3.4 atm, close to atmospheric conditions, shown here assuming (a) no precipitation of minerals and (b) precipitation of any supersaturated minerals included in the indicated database. This illustrates both the chemical speciation of U and the scope and selectivity of the databases.</p>
        <p>dissolution (Cerrato et al., 2013). Alternatively, a strong acid (H 3 PO 4 -HF-H 2 SO 4 ) extraction followed by a U(VI) specific analytical method can help to speciate the U (Luan and Burgos, 2012).</p>
        <p>The solubility of the various UO 2 (s) phases is important since they are often suspected of controlling U solubility in reduced waters and sediments. Also, selective dissolution with various organic ligands can help to separate the more soluble biogenic non-crystalline UO 2 forms from chemogenic ones (Chardi et al., 2022) and can thus contribute to understanding the solid phase speciation of U in sediments.</p>
        <p>The multiplicity of possible mineral-U reactions, and their overlap, often makes it difficult to determine the most important reactions taking place. It is always going to be difficult to detect trace U minerals at the ppm level. The use of XAS (XANES, EXAFS) has been particularly useful in determining the binding environment of U in minerals (Bargar et al., 1999;Fuller et al., 2002;O'Loughlin et al., 2003;Rossberg et al., 2009;van Veelen et al., 2012) but the methods are not sensitive enough to analyse U in minor phases such as in sediments with average U contents. Nevertheless, with more contaminated sediments, such as at old mine sites, where bulk U concentrations can exceed 400 mg/kg, EXAFS has proven very valuable in identifying the U-binding phases. For example, Lahrouch et al. ( 2021) used EXAFS combined with other mineralogical and geochemical techniques on samples of granitic waste rock and mine drainage to show that the U was closely associated with iron oxides, particularly with 2-line ferrihydrite. They were even able to identify ternary Fhy-U-P and Fhy-U-C(carboxylate) complexes in the most contaminated samples. EXAFS also identified Fhy and chlorite as the dominant U phases in some Canadian mine wastes (Othmane et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>The oxides of Fe, Al and Mn are ubiquitous in nature and strongly bind U and many other trace elements. Iron oxides are particularly abundant and reactive and so it is not surprising that there have been numerous studies of the interactions of U with Fe oxides. Iron oxides also undergo redox transformations under similar conditions to that of U. The most abundant iron oxides are ferrihydrite, goethite and hematite under oxidizing conditions, and magnetite and green rusts under reducing conditions. Ferrihydrite is an intrinsically heterogeneous, highsurface-area, metastable form of iron oxide that is favoured in situations where iron oxides have formed relatively recently, as in many soils and sediments, and especially where active weathering is taking place or where redox conditions have fluctuated. It also often forms coatings on other minerals. Iron oxides are also readily synthesized in the laboratory and so have served as model oxides which have been widely used in the development of surface complexation models to quantify sorption (Table 11).</p>
        <p>Systematic laboratory studies of U sorption by iron oxides (Table 11) mean that the principal factors controlling the sorption of U by oxides are now quite well understood, at least under oxidizing conditions. pH is the main variable and so the sorption is often reported as a %U adsorbed versus pH curve with U sorption increasing rapidly over the range pH 4-6 (Hiemstra et al., 2009;Kobayashi et al., 2020;Waite et al., 1994). The actual pH range showing this rapid rise (the 'edge') depends on the total amount of U present and the solid/solution ratio. The PCO 2 , which controls dissolved carbonate concentrations, can be another key variable (Fig. 9). Other variables are the specific surface area of the mineral, the concentrations of competitors, ionic strength and temperature. The minimum dissolved U concentration in these studies is in the range 10 -9 to 10 -8 M or about 0.24-2.4 μg/L at a pH close to pH 7. While % sorption-pH plots are popular, they can disguise important features especially when the sorption is above 90%. Plots of log(dissolved U)-pH or of the distribution coefficient-pH can be more revealing and are better suited for archiving purposes.</p>
        <p>When a U-containing solution is exposed to the atmosphere, CO 2 (g) is absorbed and carbonate ions are formed. This results in the formation of dissolved uranyl carbonate species, as discussed above (Section 7.3) and leads to a sharp decline in uranyl activity and hence U sorption. Other co-ions can also lead to a decrease in U sorption, as demonstrated for P sorption on goethite at high pH (T. Cheng et al., 2004) and Si sorption on ferrihydrite (Gustafsson et al., 2009) but here the effects due to complexation in solution must be combined with those due to competition for surface sites and the possible formation of ternary surface species. The presence of Ca above pH 7 decreases U sorption by ferrihydrite probably due to the formation of stable U-Ca-CO 3 ternary species in solution (Fox et al., 2006). These are not favourably adsorbed for both charge and coordination reasons. Payne et al. (1996) noted a strong positive influence of PO 4 sorption to ferrihydrite at pH &lt; 7, with increased sorption of U attributed to the formation of ternary surface complexes with UO 2 2+ and PO 4 3-. These were concluded to be inner-sphere surface complexes at least up to about pH 8. Payne et al. (1994) also noted a reduction in U sorption affinity following the aging of ferrihydrite to more crystalline forms. The mechanisms of U sorption have been studied extensively with EXAFS and FTIR spectroscopy and by modelling (Table 11). EXAFS is able to reveal bond lengths and provides support for the nature of U binding, including the presence of ternary complexes such as surface-U-CO 3 species. Aging of ferrihydrite to hematite has been found to result in incorporation of U into the hematite structure, with EXAFS and XANES data suggesting incorporation by replacing octahedrally coordinated Fe (III) (Marshall et al., 2014). Surface complexation (i.e. electrostatic) models are required for a detailed understanding since the variable sorption of ions, including H + , leads to a change in the surface potential and surface charge and so affects further sorption. Even the sorption of UO 2 2+ will itself change the surface potential although because it is normally only present at very low concentrations, it is unlikely to be a major potential determining ion.</p>
        <p>As shown above (Section 7.1), the predominant U species in solution changes from a cation under acidic conditions (UO 2 2+ ) to an anion at high pH, e.g. UO 2 (OH) 3 -, or to UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 4and CaUO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 2-in the presence of CO 2 (g) and Ca (Wazne et al., 2003). The point of zero charge (pzc) of ferrihydrite is pH 8.1 and so above this pH, the surface charge becomes negative which combined with the dominance of anionic U species in solution results in a repulsion that tends to inhibit sorption. The pzc's of other iron oxides are also generally in the range pH 7-9.5 (Kosmulski, 2009). The most successful surface-complexation models for describing this sorption quantitatively are the Diffuse Layer Model (Mahoney et al., 2009;Waite et al., 1994), the CD-MUSIC model (Gustafsson et al., 2009;Hiemstra et al., 2009) and the Extended Triple Layer Model (Kobayashi et al., 2020). These differ in the location of the sorbed charge, the way that this interacts with the surface charge and the change in water dipoles in response to sorption. The latter two models attempt to reconcile their simplified structural models with information obtained from spectroscopy and molecular modelling. This also helps to constrain the number of adjustable parameters during model fitting. These studies indicate that the binding of U is predominantly as a bidentate inner-sphere species.</p>
        <p>It has been found that in the presence of CO 2 (g) and high pH, although dissolved carbonate reduces sorption, it is necessary to include one or more ternary surface-U-CO 3 complexes in the model to explain all of the experimental data (Rossberg et al., 2009). Ignoring such species would require either an adjustment to the log K's of solution U-CO 3 species (Hsi and Langmuir, 1985), which is undesirable, or accepting a poorer fit to the observations. The relative importance of these ternary species remains one of the differences between existing models (Kobayashi et al., 2020). Differences between predictions from the different models and experiment generally tend to only become apparent in more complex systems, particularly where the model is tested outside its range of calibration. Somewhat surprisingly, this can include sorption under CO 2 -free conditions at high pH (Kobayashi et al., 2020). Where a sorption model is required for a range of three or more orders of magnitude in dissolved U concentration, the intrinsic</p>
        <p>Sorption-pH edges, pH 3.5-10, U T = 10 -6 M, I = 0.02, 0.1 and 0.5. PCO 2 = 10 -3.5 atm DLM with single site and three adsorbed U species including a U-CO 3 species Fitted model for hematite was the same as for Fhy after scaling for their different specific surface areas (x5) heterogeneity of ferrihydrite might also need to be considered, most simply by resolving into high-and low-affinity sites (Dzombak and Morel, 1991;Mendez and Hiemstra, 2020;Waite et al., 1994). This separation does not necessarily imply that there are just two distinct classes of sites but is an efficient and practical way of capturing the apparent heterogeneity.</p>
        <p>The effect of the sorption of other ions such as the strongly-bound phosphate ion is largely untested but laboratory experiments have shown that it can increase U sorption by iron and aluminium oxides at neutral to acidic pH's through the formation of a ternary U-P surface complex (T. Cheng et al., 2004;Guo et al., 2009;Payne et al., 1996). Anecdotal evidence from U transport studies with phosphate-amended sediments supports this, at least in the short-term (Mehta et al., 2015). The impact above pH 8 is less clear.</p>
        <p>Sorption of U to iron-oxide minerals under reducing conditions is more difficult to study and is complicated by reductive dissolution, particularly of ferrihydrite which can transform to more stable minerals including goethite, magnetite and green rust. Green rust's major role may also be to catalyze the reduction of U(VI) to U(IV), producing highly insoluble UO 2 nano particles (O'Loughlin et al., 2003). Uranium is also reduced and strongly sorbed by zero-valent Fe which can be incorporated into a permeable reactive barrier to restrict the mobility of soil or groundwater U or used in nanoparticle form as an adsorbent (X. Zhao et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Aluminium oxides and hydroxides such as boehmite (γ-AlOOH) and gibbsite (α-Al(OH) 3 ) are common minerals in soils and also strongly sorb a wide variety of trace elements including U (Karamalidis and Dzombak, 2011). Most side-by-side comparisons on a weight-weight basis suggest sorption is slightly less strong for Al minerals than for Fe minerals (Wang et al., 2022). The Al minerals are not sensitive to changes in redox which makes their contribution to U binding under moderately reducing conditions, where Fe oxides are unstable, that much more significant. However, they have not received the attention of Fe oxides, probably because the U binding is less strong, perhaps aided by the fact that they are not so brightly coloured and so less visible in soils and sediments! Aluminium oxides are relatively soluble under both moderately acidic and moderately alkaline conditions, which makes them more difficult to study over a wide pH range. They are also more amenable to crystallization and transformation than iron oxides: there is no stable Al equivalent of ferrihydrite, for example.</p>
        <p>As a result, the surface acidity of Al oxides is not as well resolved as for iron oxides with pzc's of gibbsite varying from pH 8.7 to 11 (Adekola et al., 2011), indicating a net positive surface charge below pH 9 or so. There can also be considerable hysteresis in acid-base titrations of gibbsite (Adekola et al., 2011) exacerbated by mineral dissolution below pH 5 and above pH 8.5. There is minimal U sorption below pH 4 but this increases rapidly with increasing pH (McKinley et al., 1995;Sylwester et al., 2000). ATR FTIR and EXAFS of U sorbed to gibbsite suggest the formation of an inner-sphere bidentate ternary surface-U(VI)-CO 3 species when equilibrated with the atmosphere (Jo et al., 2018), and the formation of polynuclear species or surface precipitation of U in the absence of substantial carbonate, even at micromolar U concentrations (Froideval et al., 2006;Gückel et al., 2012;Kowal-Fouchard et al., 2004;Müller et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>Manganese oxides and oxyhydroxides are redox-active and readily undergo oxidative precipitation and reductive dissolution. They tend to be an order of magnitude less abundant than iron oxides but bind cations more strongly than Fe oxides (O'Reilly and Hochella Jr, 2003;Trivedi and Axe, 1999). Uranium is strongly bound to biogenic and chemically-precipitated manganese oxides, making them a potential sink for U(VI) in the natural environment (Wang et al., 2013a), and as a possible adsorbent in U(VI) recovery schemes (Al-Attar and Dyer, 2002;Ren et al., 2020). Natural and synthetic Mn oxides exist in many forms with a corresponding range of surface acidities (Cristiano et al., 2011;Tan et al., 2008), specific surface areas (Ren et al., 2020) and crystal structures (tunnels and layers). They are normally negatively charged above pH 1.5-6 and bind U as a bidentate complex with the maximum loading directly related to their specific surface area (Ren et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Sorption of other trace-metal cations to synthetic hydrous Mn oxides tends to increase up to about pH 7-8 and then remains constant up to pH 10 (Tonkin et al., 2004) but for U in the presence of CO 2 (g), the maximum sorption is at pH 6 and thereafter diminishes, reflecting the increasing role of dissolved uranyl carbonate species as with Fe oxides (Han et al., 2007). There is a small isotopic fractionation (ca. 0.2‰) during sorption, with the lighter 235 U being favourably adsorbed (Brennecka et al., 2011), a feature also observed in marine ferromanganese crusts (Goto et al., 2014). Sorption of metal ions to Mn oxides often leads to the co-release of Mn 2+ to solution which points to a more complex mechanism than for Fe oxides.</p>
        <p>Silica (SiO 2 ) comes in various polymorphs ranging in solubility from about 6 to 14 mg/L SiO 2 for quartz to 70-150 mg/L SiO 2 for amorphous silica at 25 • C. It is relatively stable and insensitive to changes in both pH and Eh. Quartz can adsorb U (Prikryl et al., 2001) but is unlikely to be a major adsorbent because of its low specific surface area (&lt;1 m 2 /g). However amorphous Si, with a specific surface area of several hundred m 2 /g, can adsorb U quite efficiently (Hou et al., 2021;Kowal-Fouchard et al., 2004;McKinley et al., 1995) and natural opal, a form of amorphous silica, is known to sometimes contain large contents of U (Table 5) (Massey et al., 2014b;Neymark and Paces, 2000). The U in opals and agates may be present as concentric bands showing green luminescence. The U in opals may sometimes be associated with Fe or Ca impurities. TRFLS has shown that the U in opals derived from mineralized rhyolitic lavas in Mexico was sorbed as U-phosphate or polynuclear U-OH species trapped on the internal surfaces of the opal (Othmane et al., 2016). However, pure, synthetic opals can also incorporate U into their structure (Massey et al., 2014b;Schindler et al., 2017). Like the other oxides, U adsorbs to the surface of amorphous SiO 2 via an inner-sphere, bidentate surface complex (Pan et al., 2021;Reich et al., 1998;Sylwester et al., 2000). Using EXAFS, Sylwester et al. (2000) also detected U-U coordination at a pH of about 6.5 and at micromolar U concentrations on amorphous silica. This signal is characteristic of a polynuclear species or of a surface precipitate, albeit in this case, not of schoepite. The stability of U in these forms of microcrystalline silica, including their thermal stability, has led to interest in their use for long-term storage of U-rich wastes.</p>
        <p>Other metal oxides also adsorb U and can have superior mechanical properties to the common Fe, Al and Mn oxides for industrial use. For example, an experimental plant was operated in Japan from 1981 to 1988 using a hydrous titanium dioxide sorbent to sorb U from seawater. However, low sorption capacities of approximately 0.1 mg of U/g of sorbent led to the discontinuation of this project (Abney et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>Clay minerals generally have high specific surface areas and so would be expected to adsorb U. However, ion exchange on the exterior basal surfaces and interlayer spaces would be expected to be rather unselective and hence of minor importance, especially when U is complexed with carbonate. Sorption by clays is therefore dominated by inner-sphere complexes with aluminol, silanol, Mg and Fe sites located at the edges (Catalano and Brown, 2005;Chisholm-Brause et al., 2004;D. Pan et al., 2022;Zhang et al., 2018) and the sorption bears some similarities to that found on the corresponding oxides. Maximum sorption occurs at about pH 6-7 and is lower in the presence of CO 2 (Marques Fernandes et al., 2012;Pabalan and Turner, 1997). Pan et al. (2022) found a reversible increase in U(VI) sorption on phlogopite with temperature (25-65 • C), and above pH 10, a marked increase in U uptake probably due to the precipitation of a solid such as metaschoepite. In the presence of high concentrations of Ca, the formation of Ca-UO 2 -CO 3 complexes further suppresses U sorption (Joseph et al., 2011;Stockmann et al., 2022). The edges show pH-dependent charging behaviour and for montmorillonite, the surface potential of the edge sites is complicated in that there is an interaction with the adjacent negatively-charged basal sites, the so-called 'spillover effect'. This is a significant feature of modelling ion sorption at the edge sites and its inclusion has enabled U sorption to be predicted accurately for a wide variety of conditions using a single-site/three-species sorption model (Tournassat et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>The aluminol sites bind U more strongly than the silanol sites on montmorillonite but are different from those on a gibbsite surface for which there is no spillover effect (Turner et al., 1996). Unlike recent models for U sorption on oxides, there is no evidence that ternary surface-U-CO 3 complexes are significantly involved (Stockmann et al., 2022;Tournassat et al., 2018), a conclusion supported by molecular dynamics simulations for kaolinite (Kerisit and Liu, 2014) but contrary to some earlier models (Marques Fernandes et al., 2012). Molecular dynamic calculations also suggest that polynuclear surface complexes may be significant on montmorillonite above pH 8 but these have so far not been identified experimentally (Catalano and Brown, 2005;Zhang et al., 2018). Bachmaf and Merkel (2011) found that kaolinite adsorbed U more strongly than montmorillonite above pH 5, an observation attributed to the greater abundance and activity of aluminol sites on kaolinite. TiO 2 impurities (especially anatase) are common in kaolinite and these may also influence the sorption of U (Bachmaf and Merkel, 2011;Payne et al., 1998).</p>
        <p>Industrially, kaolinite has been investigated for the removal of U impurities from phosphoric acid (40% P 2 O 5 ) produced during fertilizer manufacture. Activating the kaolinite by heat treatment (700 • C) improved the removal efficiency up to about 70% (Taha et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>Given the global extent of limestone-rich natural environments, the interactions of U with Ca, Mg and CO 3 are of particular importance. Uranium forms solid solutions with carbonate minerals such as calcite, aragonite and vaterite, giving U concentrations in carbonate rocks typically in the range 0.1-10 mg/kg (Kelly et al., 2003) (Table 5). Minor minerals such as apatite and pyrite can also contribute to the U content of carbonate sediments. Although carbonate minerals are not normally associated with high-U groundwaters, the release of U from the dissolution of carbonates has been implicated as the source of U in some German groundwaters following treatment and reinjection of CO 2 -rich groundwater into shallow Quaternary sediments (Banning et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>Calcite is the most abundant carbonate mineral worldwide but the large UO 2 2+ cation fits better into the octahedrally-coordinated environment of aragonite than that of calcite. The coordination of U in aragonite matches that of the UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 4-ion which favours U incorporation into aragonite (Smrzka et al., 2019) but this does mean that U can be released from aragonite if it recrystallizes to calcite (Lachniet et al., 2012). The incorporation in aragonite can be achieved both abiotically (Chen et al., 2016;Reeder et al., 2001) and biotically (Drysdale et al., 2019). The U content of aragonitic fossil corals has been used in various palaeo-environmental reconstructions (Gothmann et al., 2019;Smrzka et al., 2019). The U contents of marine foraminera are believed to reflect past seawater U concentrations (Russell et al., 1994) and the U content of an annually-banded stalagmite showed a variation related to the monsoonal cycles (Johnson et al., 2006). However, unlike for foraminifer and corals, the U/Ca ratio in bivalves does not appear to be simply related to ocean chemistry (Gillikin and Dehairs, 2013). The smaller U 4+ ion found in reduced environments is more readily incorporated into calcite and can lead to U concentrations in calcite of up to 35 mg/kg (Sturchio et al., 1998).</p>
        <p>Originally it was thought that the UO 2 2+ cation was too large and of dissimilar coordination to substitute for Ca 2+ in the calcite structure but EXAFS evidence now suggests that natural calcite can grow sufficiently slowly for U to be incorporated in a relatively stable position (Kelly et al., 2003). Synthetic calcites grown rapidly in the laboratory are more likely to concentrate U in defects and other disordered sites. Uranium can also be adsorbed onto pre-existing mineral carbonate surfaces with preferential binding to step edges over flat surfaces (Reeder et al., 2004;Rihs et al., 2004). Molecular dynamics calculations suggest that an outer-sphere complex is most likely (Doudou et al., 2012) indicating rather weak and non-specific binding. The overall extent of sorption is likely limited by the relatively low specific surface areas of natural calcites (&lt;1 m 2 /g) (Cubillas et al., 2005) and their low affinity for U (Tran et al., 2021). The indirect effects of calcite in blocking access to potential high-affinity sorbing sites, such as those on the edges of phyllosilicate minerals, combined with its role in maintaining high concentrations of neutral Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 or negatively-charged UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 4-dissolved species, are likely to be more important than its direct role as an adsorbent (Dong et al., 2005). Uranium can also form many carbonate-containing minerals, such as liebigite, Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 ⋅10H 2 O (Alwan and Williams, 1980), but these are relatively soluble and are unlikely to control U concentrations in most natural waters. However, there may be exceptions (Nolan et al., 2021). They are occasionally found as secondary minerals in U-rich environments such as oxidized ore bodies and as efflorescences on mine walls.</p>
        <p>Uranium is a common minor component in phosphate minerals such as apatite, hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite and in phosphate-rich rocks (Table 5), especially those of 'younger' (Ordovician-Neogene) marine sedimentary origin (Sun et al., 2020). Phosphate forms strong bonds with both U(VI) and U(IV) and is responsible for the reversible sorption of U to primary phosphate minerals such as natural and synthetic apatite (Thomson et al., 2003) and amorphous calcium phosphate (Mehta et al., 2016), as well as the less-reversible uptake by derivatives such as bone charcoal (Fuller et al., 2003) and synthetic Cu-substituted hydroxyapatite (Szenknect et al., 2020). Dissolution of phosphates can also affect U indirectly through the formation of autunite-type minerals and ternary Fhy-U(VI)-P complexes on minerals such as ferrihydrite (Lahrouch et al., 2021). It also enhances the production of non-crystalline UO 2 during U(VI) to U(IV) reduction (Alessi et al., 2014b). Phosphate groups on cell walls are also able to sorb uranium ('biosorption') and certain fungi are able to use phosphatases to precipitate various exotic U-P minerals on hyphal surfaces (Liang et al., 2015). Phosphate minerals, directly or indirectly, can therefore aid the immobilization of U in many ways.</p>
        <p>Dissolved U(VI) is rapidly immobilized in a wide range of natural and synthetic sulphide minerals (Descostes et al., 2010;Ma et al., 2015;Wersin et al., 1994;Xiao et al., 2017). Amorphous FeS has been found to rapidly reduce U(VI) to a reduced UO 2 , U 4 O 9 or U 3 O 8 solid phase with a consequent lowering of U solubility and release of Fe 2+ (Hua and Deng, 2008). Hyun et al. (2012) showed that the reduction and formation of uraninite could be initiated by sorption to a fine-grained mackinawite (FeS). Fine-grained mackinawite is an early product of sulphide reduction and not only instigates U reduction but can provide a redox buffer against future oxidation of the reduced U phases. However, when there is a large amount of oxygen available, the reverse may happen: oxidation of FeS can catalyze the oxidation of non-crystalline U(IV) (Loreggian et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>The reactivity of crystalline pyrite (FeS 2 ) is low but fine-grained pyrite is considerably more reactive, and in natural pyrite is increased by the presence of trace-element impurities such as As (B. Ma et al., 2020). Uranium(VI) can also adsorb to pyrite surfaces and transform to UO 2 (s) especially in the pH range around 5-7 (Descostes et al., 2010;Wersin et al., 1994), but U(IV) can also be precipitated as a hyperstoichiometric UO 2+x solid (Bruggeman and Maes, 2010;Descostes et al., 2010). The surface of pyrite can adsorb a wide variety of ions including H + and Fe 2+ which compete for surface sites and can reduce U sorption.</p>
        <p>7.6. Natural organic matter (NOM)</p>
        <p>Natural organic matter is found in almost all natural waters, sediments and soils and gives rise to their brown colour. This ubiquity combined with their inherently high and selective metal-binding capacity makes them important materials in the speciation of all trace metals, including U, in natural environments.</p>
        <p>Given this intrinsic reactivity towards a wide range of ligands, it is not surprising that U binds very strongly to many NOMs ranging from humic-type compounds and cell surfaces to synthetic organics (Davis et al., 2000;Gustafsson et al., 2009;Higgo et al., 1993;Lofts et al., 2015;Reiller and Buckau, 2012). The uranyl ion, UO 2 2+ , is one of the most strongly bound divalent cations, and normally binds more strongly to NOM than Cu 2+ and even Pb 2+ (Milne et al., 2003). This binding is important since it can affect U toxicity and mobility as well as presenting the possibility of using these materials for the extraction of U from water or for immobilizing U in contaminated soils.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, given the complexity of uranium chemistry and the experimental difficulty of determining the individual activities of U species, most of the present understanding of humic-metal ion interactions has come from laboratory studies not directly involving U, although some reviews have targeted U and other radionuclides specifically (Reiller, 2012;Reiller and Buckau, 2012).</p>
        <p>Sometimes NOM can be responsible for the natural accumulation of U to high levels. For example, Lefebvre et al. (2022) describe a small, pristine alpine wetland catchment in southern France where U has accumulated to concentrations of up to 1000-5000 mg/kg in the shallow, organic-rich soils. They used a variety of techniques including isotope ratios, μ-XRF, SEM-EDX, EPMA, XANES and EXAFS to identify the nature of the U and concluded that it was predominantly U(VI) bound to NOM (HA). It appears that the U had accumulated over the course of some 14,500 years as a result of the prolonged input from some unidentified but probably mineralized source in the adjacent granitic landscape.</p>
        <p>NOM is often operationally divided into dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM). The distinction between the two is based on some form of separation: filtration, centrifugation, or dialysis, and can depend on environmental conditions such as pH. An alternative classification is based on chemical extraction. The most reactive components of the NOMs found in soils and natural waters are humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA). These are the relatively stable end products of the decomposition or oxidation of fresh organic. They are separated from each other by their solubility under acid and alkaline conditions: HA is soluble in alkali but insoluble ('flocculated') in acid, while FA is soluble ('dispersed') in both alkali and acid. Humin is the organic fraction that is insoluble in both alkali and acid. It is relatively unreactive.</p>
        <p>An estimate of the DOM concentrations in natural waters can be made using various empirical relations including those based on UV-Vis spectroscopy (Li and Hur, 2017). The Cu complexation by DOM-containing natural waters suggested that the effective FA concentration was 65% of the DOM concentration but only after the impact of measured EDTA and NTA concentrations, a feature of some urban waters, had been included (Ahmed et al., 2014). Soil and sediment organic C is made up of approximately 40% FA + HA with HA/FA ca. 3 (Ukalska-Jaruga et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>Measuring the free UO 2 2+ ion concentration in the presence of NOM-U species is difficult, especially at trace concentrations. Several approaches are possible (Pesavento et al., 2009). One is to use the Donnan Membrane Technique (DMT) which has two aqueous compartments separated by a cation-exchange resin. The donor side contains the free metal ion of interest and its complexes while the acceptor side contains the metal ion at some fixed activity, possibly including a ligand with well-known properties to increase the sensitivity of the method. Pure minerals, such as UO 2 (s), are also able to 'fix' activities in solution and if the solubility product was well known, could in principle be used to fix the uranyl activity. Cations transfer across the resin until a Donnan equilibrium is achieved. This may take many days and so more rapid, dynamic variations have been devised (Marang et al., 2006). Reiller et al. (2011) used such a technique to derive NICA-Donnan parameters for U(VI) binding to Gorleben HA and an insolubilized HA. Another approach is the Diffuse Gradient in Thin film (DGT) method which relies on the diffusion of the free metal ion through a gel and onto a resin that acts as a sink for the ion. This has also been applied to U binding by HA/FA solutions (J. Zhao et al., 2020). HA and FA are variously described as colloids, polyelectrolytes or as a polydisperse mixture of molecules with a variable molecular weight. They have a variable net negative charge under all conditions. This charge arises from the dissociation of a wide variety of weak acid sites broadly classified as 'carboxylic-type' sites and 'phenolic-type' sites (Milne et al., 2001;Reiller and Buckau, 2012). The separation into HA and FA relates to more fundamental structural features; FA generally has a slightly higher charge and lower average molecular weight than HA and these properties tend to keep it in solution rather than in an aggregated state. There are more carboxylic-type sites than phenolic-type sites, especially in FA's that contain a greater number of oxygen-containing groups than HA's. Carboxylic-type sites are likely to dominate U binding especially under acidic conditions (Schmeide et al., 2003). Metal-ion binding generally increases with increasing ionic strength (Kinniburgh et al., 1999) but the effect is rather small, especially for FA, and is not universally observed (Glaus et al., 1997).</p>
        <p>Humic substances have almost linear proton titration (charge-pH) curves and while they vary in detail when derived from different sources, they also show broadly similar charging behaviour (Milne et al., 2001) and cation binding (Milne et al., 2003). In simple systems, the binding of most multivalent cations increases monotonically with increasing pH. UO 2 2+ would be expected to be bound very strongly by both HA and FA based on its tendency to hydrolyze (Milne et al., 2003) and this has indeed been observed (Glaus et al., 1997;Reiller et al., 2011). At a molecular level, EXAFS has demonstrated the similarity between the binding of U to HA and to various uranyl carboxylates (Denecke et al., 1997).</p>
        <p>Modelling the binding of uranium to NOM is complex. Prerequisites for capturing metal-ion binding behaviour over a wide range of environmental conditions must consider that: (i) there is an intrinsic binding heterogeneity of NOM and this heterogeneity is a priori unknown both in form and in detail (requires a multisite model); (ii) different ions behave differently and there is site competition between them (requires a multicomponent model); (iii) binding of ions involves variable charging of the NOM and associated electrostatic interactions (requires an electrostatic model); (iv) humic substances adsorb to mineral surfaces but this varies with solution chemistry (requires a ternary model), and (v) there may be kinetic effects with some of the bound ions slowly becoming irreversibly bound to the humic substance (kinetic model).</p>
        <p>The heterogeneity is most readily seen in the almost linear proton titration curves over a broad range of pH (pH 3-10). This cannot be described with a single-site model, i.e. with one log K. It can be explained either by assuming a small number of discrete proton-binding sites with varying log K's, or by assuming some form of continuation distribution, or distributions of sites. A number of models of varying complexity and scope have been developed for describing metal-ion binding by such heterogeneous humic substances, but the two most successful are Model VI/VII of Tipping (Tipping, 1998;Tipping et al., 2011) and the NICA-Donnan model of Kinniburgh et al. (1999). The former is an example of a discrete site model incorporating multidentate binding and specifically designed for humic materials, while the latter is a general-purpose continuous distribution model based on monodentate binding. In practice, proton charging curves and metal-ion binding can usually be described almost equally well with either model. An elementary analysis of the proton charging curve indicates some form of bimodal distribution and so the continuous distribution approach works best if binding is described as the sum of two distributions corresponding to a spread in log K's for the carboxylic-type and phenolic-type sites described above. In the NICA-Donnan model, these distributions are based on Sips distributions (Koopal et al., 2020). There is considerable overlap of the two distributions at near neutral pH's.</p>
        <p>The different behaviour of different ions is reflected in the 'non-ideal' behaviour of the ions: it is not possible to simulate the behaviour of one cation by simply adjusting the log K of another cation as in the competitive Langmuir isotherm. The affinity distributions are not fully correlated and a single cation-specific shift of the median log K simply does not work. Also, the binding isotherms remain nonlinear at very low metal concentrations, a feature that is uniquely characteristic of NOM, and difficult to reproduce with many models. Bidentate binding at high loadings and high pH, a feature confirmed for Pb binding using EXAFS (Xiong et al., 2013), may also account for some of the apparent non-ideality seen in the NICA-Donnan approach. Furthermore, while there are similarities in behaviour between different humic substances (HS), there are also important differences and so optimization of at least some of the isotherm parameters will be required for accurately describing interactions with specific HS's (Xiong et al., 2013). Equally, parameters derived from the analysis of specific HS's may not be appropriate for generic modelling.</p>
        <p>The variable charging induced by different cations is revealed in the non-stochiometric nature of the binding: for example, binding a divalent cation, such as Cd 2+ , on a H + -saturated sample of NOM does not release two H + but somewhat fewer (Kinniburgh et al., 1999), a feature that has a direct relationship with the observed pH dependency of ion binding. This results in a change in surface charge and surface potential that will affect the binding of all cations and so contribute to competitive interactions. The simplest model to account for this non-specific electrostatic effect and the requirement for overall charge balance in the adsorbed phase is the Donnan model. More complex, and potentially more realistic, models are possible (Koopal et al., 2020;Pinheiro et al., 2021;Town et al., 2019) but the simplicity of the Donnan model is attractive. A key parameter of the Donnan model is the Donnan volume which is the volume that contains the charge-neutralizing cations. This increases with decreasing ionic strength, especially for HA's, and is reflected in the swelling and gel-like characteristics of humic substances, a feature that is both observed and that plays a role in modelling its interactions with mineral surfaces.</p>
        <p>This overall complexity results in a large number of model parameters which requires an extensive range of well-spaced experimental data to resolve. When such datasets are not available, some parameters may need to be estimated independently, or the model simplified. Care must be taken not to replace these poorly-defined parameters with arbitrary, post-hoc assumptions.</p>
        <p>Unlike many metals, U is found to be bound most strongly to humic substances in mildly acidic conditions (pH &lt; 6), at least under open atmospheric conditions (Gustafsson et al., 2009;Lofts et al., 2015;Reiller et al., 2011). At higher pH's, increasing carbonate concentrations limit the amount of U bound as the activity of uranyl rapidly decreases and the dominant U species becomes either neutral or negatively charged as with the oxides (Section 7.5.2). This accounts for the rather unusual behaviour of U in that U can become less strongly bound above pH 7 and reflects the fact that in most experimental studies, the systems are open to the atmosphere and so contain dissolved U-CO 3 species (Gustafsson et al., 2009). Also pH can affect the apparent 'solubility' of HA's and so reduce the apparent binding of U at high pH when the speciation is based on a size-sensitive separation technique such as centrifugation (Dublet et al., 2017). In terms of the percentage of U bound to NOM and hence its relative importance, this is greatest for very low U concentrations and high NOM concentrations.</p>
        <p>Accounting for possible competitive effects between U and multiple macro-and trace cations is obviously important and not yet well tested. The impact on U binding would be expected to be greatest for low concentrations of dissolved U relative to the other metal ions. At higher U concentrations, as in mine-impacted waters, co-contaminants may have very little impact on the overall speciation especially in neutral to alkaline waters where carbonate complexes will dominate the speciation (Lofts et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>Humic and fulvic acids adsorb to the surfaces of many minerals (Philippe and Schaumann, 2014) and this is of importance both for the overall binding of uranium and its mobility. Humic substances can be considered as large anions that can adsorb to mineral surface sites rather like other ions and so there are also sorption isotherms for these humic substances that respond to various environmental conditions. Sorption increases with increasing HA/FA concentration in a Langmuir-like fashion and ultimately can lead to a reversal of the apparent surface charge (Ho and Miller, 1985). Sorption is greatest at low pH (2-3 mg/m at pH 4 on goethite) and decreases by a factor 2-3 on going from pH 4 to 10, a feature that can be modelled, although not simply (Weng et al., 2006a(Weng et al., , 2007)). Sorption in terms of mass is several times greater for the larger HA molecules compared with FA. It is also more pH-and ionic-strength-dependent for HA compared with FA, reflecting a conformational change in the shape of the adsorbed HA when it is close to a mineral surface (Weng et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>pH can also affect the interactions between NOM and U and result in the precipitation of U minerals. An analysis of the interaction between U and Suwannee River NOM found that soluble U-DOM complexes were observed at pH 7 while at pH 4, a nanocrystalline U(VI) solid had formed (Velasco et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>In many natural environments, minerals such as ferrihydrite (Fhy) or goethite are also present alongside NOM and understanding the overall binding must consider all these components as well as their possible interactions. Payne et al. (1996) found that HA was strongly sorbed by Fhy and in a Fhy-HA-U mixture, increased U sorption by Fhy below pH with little effect at higher pH. Dublet et al. (2017) also found that NOM increased the overall binding of U in acid conditions (pH 4.6), probably via a ternary Fhy-NOM-U complex (supported by EXAFS), but that at pH 7, the adsorbed U was dominantly associated with Fhy alone. These experiments were performed in open air conditions and so at neutral and higher pH would have been susceptible to U-CO 3 formation in solution.</p>
        <p>Adsorbed NOM coatings can partially cover mineral surfaces and potentially block sorption sites, but the interactions can be complicated as seen clearly with PO 4 sorption on goethite: below pH 5, FA reduces PO 4 sorption by goethite but above that pH and in the presence of Ca, it increases PO 4 sorption because the Ca 2+ ion is also bound to the FA and reduces the net negative surface charge, thereby facilitating PO 4 sorption (Weng et al., 2012). The LCD model (Van Riemsdijk et al., 2006;Weng et al., 2007Weng et al., , 2008b) ) attempts to account for these interactions by combining the CD-MUSIC model for ion binding to mineral surfaces with the NICA-Donnan model for the humic substances (Van Riemsdijk et al., 2006) along with a factor that accounts for the spatial distribution of the sorbed NOM charge in relation to the mineral surface charge (Weng et al., 2007). The smaller size of FA molecules means that they can interact more closely (in the Stern layer) with positively-charged mineral surfaces such as goethite whereas bound HA extends beyond the Stern layer (Weng et al., 2006b) and has weaker electrostatic interactions and a smaller competitive effect with ions such as PO 4 (Weng et al., 2008b(Weng et al., , 2009)).</p>
        <p>The size of the larger HA molecules increases with decreasing ionic strength and this swelling prevents the molecules coming close enough to the mineral surface to compete with other adsorbed counterions and so affect the surface potential. This effect diminishes with increasing ionic strength, accounting for the relatively large ionic strength dependency of HA binding. The size of the much smaller FA molecules is less dependent on ionic strength (Weng et al., 2007). As the extent of NOM binding to mineral surfaces increases, the impact of the underlying mineral will be increasingly masked and so become less important with the ternary behaviour eventually becoming dominated by the NOM (Li et al., 2022). The magnitude of these interactions has yet to be established for U.</p>
        <p>An additional complication in modelling ternary mineral-metal ion-NOM interactions is that there can be fractionation of the HS during sorption, e.g. preferential sorption of the higher-molecular-weight fractions, as can be seen by changes in the apparent molecular masses and UV-visible and luminescence spectra as well as the complexation properties of the dissolved component (Bryan et al., 2012;Reiller and Buckau, 2012;Van de Weerd et al., 2002). It is also possible that the apparent molecular weight of humic substances can change with ionic strength perhaps explaining in part the ionic strength dependency of HA binding to mineral surfaces (Weng et al., 2007). There may also be significant kinetic effects in humic systems with the slow, possibly irreversible, binding of metals to organic matter (Bryan et al., 2012). HA's often show hysteresis in their charge-pH curves during their first full titration (Milne et al., 1995) suggesting significant conformational changes may take place following the strong acid step used to isolate and purify them.</p>
        <p>The complex modelling that is reflected in these attempts to provide a comprehensive view of the ternary interactions requires appropriate software to make the necessary calculations. Most of the popular geochemical modelling packages include at best a few of the published surface complexation models, and they usually cannot be easily modified to include new ones. An exception is the 
            <rs type="software">ORCHESTRA</rs> program (Meeussen, 2003) which has been quite widely used to develop these complex models (e.g. Weng et al., 2008a). It has a modular and hierarchical design with a text-based definition of all its chemical models, including surface complexation models. This can be quite easily edited and extended. It includes both chemical speciation and reactive transport, and is fast.
        </p>
        <p>Experimentally, the interaction of metal ions with HS has often been studied in the presence of minerals, such as ferrihydrite or clay (Beneš et al., 1998;Dublet et al., 2017;Evans et al., 2011;Ho and Miller, 1985;Ivanov et al., 2012;Joseph et al., 2011;Lenhart and Honeyman, 1999;Payne et al., 1996;Schmeide et al., 2000;Zhang et al., 2021;Zhiwei et al., 2009). This addresses the question, does the presence of HS increase or decrease the binding of the metal ion to the solid phase? The answer is that this will depend in part on the fate of the HS which itself will depend on the pH and nature of the HS (HA or FA) as discussed above. Minerals such as ferrihydrite and goethite are potentially positively charged below pH 8 and so can retain HS under neutral or acidic conditions by charge neutralization.</p>
        <p>Uranium porewater concentrations sometimes show a correlation with DOM (Cumberland et al., 2016) but interestingly porewater profiles from contaminated lake sediments in Canada showed no evidence for the release of U by reductive dissolution of Fe or Mn oxides (Novotnik et al., 2018), as often shown by other oxyanions such as As and inferred from some aquifer studies (Section 9.2).</p>
        <p>Most experiments have been based on U(VI) but U(IV) also binds strongly to NOM with the partition coefficient increasing linearly with pH over the range pH 3.5-8.5 (Evans et al., 2011). Somewhat bizarrely, the amount of binding of U(IV) in ternary systems can depend on the order of addition of the components, especially for U(IV) (Reiller and Buckau, 2012). In U-kaolin-HA mixtures, the overall binding of U to the &gt;0.2 μm kaolin-dominated fraction decreased as the concentration of added HA increased demonstrating that if HA remains soluble, it is capable of effectively solubilizing some of the U (Evans et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>Field evidence also suggests that U(IV) is strongly bound to NOM. This is derived from a detailed analysis of Swiss peats which showed that U accumulates in part as U(IV) bound to the peat organic matter (Mikutta et al., 2016). In fact, the complexation was so strong that it prevented solid UO 2 of any form being created.</p>
        <p>The concentration of ligands including DOM in natural waters can also affect the bioavailability and toxicity of U (Markich, 2002;Riethmuller et al., 2001). The Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) states that the bioavailability of a dissolved element, such as UO 2</p>
        <p>, is best predicted by the activity of the free ion rather than its total dissolved concentration. The importance of carbonate complexation in classifying the bioavailability of U in stream waters has already been noted (Lartigue et al., 2020). Numerous studies of freshwater organisms such as Chlorella sp. have shown that increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in waters is associated with the decreasing uptake and toxicity of metals, including that of U, and that DOC is often one of the best predictors of U toxicity (Markich and Twining, 2012). pH can also be important since it is a master variable in terms of speciation and affects the binding of most metal ions to cell surfaces. Uranium tends to concentrate in or near the cell wall of microbes by both active and passive mechanisms. For example, U (and Cu) toxicity to Chlorella spp. in synthetic (DOC-free) solutions decreased in going from pH 5.7 to 6.5 (Franklin et al., 2000), in line with the protective effect of cation binding to cell surfaces. Metal-reducing bacteria such as Geobacter spp. can immobilize U by the extracellular reduction of U(VI) to U(IV), possibly aided by electrically conductive pili ('hairs') attached to the cell surface, thereby protecting the internal integrity of the cell (Cologgi et al., 2011). Lopez-Fernandez et al. (2018) used time-resolved laser fluorescence spectrometry (TRLFS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and EXAFS to show that U was initially bound to the surface carboxyl groups of the yeast Rhodotorula mucigilanosa BII-R8 but that this later bound to neighbouring surface phosphate ligands in the phospholipid bilayer of the cytoplasmic membrane.</p>
        <p>As a result of the recent interest in the removal of U from wastewaters and the mining of U from the oceans, many studies have investigated adsorbents that adsorb U strongly but also have more robust physical and chemical properties than the traditional mineral adsorbents such as ferrihydrite and hydrous titanium oxide. These have focused on porous amidoxime-based polymer adsorbents which contain both amide (-NH 2 ) and oxime (-NOH) functional groups (Abney et al., 2017;Aguila et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2017;Sun et al., 2018). These are efficient adsorbents, even in the presence of ambient carbonate concentrations, and have the advantage that they are amenable to both column filtration and passive collection. However, they co-adsorb significant quantities of V, Fe and major cations, with potential unintended consequences if used on a large scale, and are susceptible to biofouling (Haji et al., 2019). Much research continues into the optimal design of synthetic U adsorbents.</p>
        <p>While the calculated solution speciation of U varies depending on the species considered and their thermodynamic properties (and hence database), a critical factor in terms of the mobility of U is how the total dissolved concentration of U varies under varying conditions irrespective of the detailed speciation. Two scenarios are of particular importance in the natural environment: (i) a change from mildly reducing to strongly reducing conditions which can lead to extremely low dissolved U concentrations, and (ii) a change in the concentration of potential ligands under oxidizing conditions, especially that of carbonate, which can lead to relatively high dissolved U concentrations.</p>
        <p>To illustrate these scenarios, the total dissolved U concentration was calculated for a simple U-Na-Cl system with each of the 12 databases under mildly to strongly reducing conditions (Eh from +0.4V to -0.4V).</p>
        <p>In each case, it was assumed that all the mineral phases defined in their respective databases were able to precipitate if their saturation indices exceeded zero. These calculations (Fig. 10) show a wide range in the calculated dissolved concentrations demonstrating the sensitivity to these parameters as well as to the great range in the solubility of the minerals selected for inclusion in the various databases. As expected, all databases show a dramatic decline in U solubility over the Eh range +0.2V to -0.2V reflecting the U(VI) to U(IV) conversion (Fig. 10(a)). The limiting concentration at low Eh (-0.4V) depends on the most stable form of UO 2 (s) included in the database with a cluster at 10 -8 to 10 -10 mol/kg water assuming an 'amorphous' form, UO 2 (am), and another cluster at 10 -13 to 10 -15 mol/kg water for those including the more stable crystalline UO 2 (cr) (uraninite) phase. This accounts for the major differences at very low Eh. Under less-strongly reducing conditions, the differences reflect the absence or presence of minerals such as schoepite, metaschoepite, clarkeite, and minerals with an intermediate oxidation state such as U 3 O 8 .</p>
        <p>For the simple system considered here, the NEA TDB-e database is unique in that it includes just one mineral capable of precipitating under these conditions, UO 2 (am, hydr), and this remains completely soluble at Eh &gt; 0.0V, thus giving rise to the horizontal lines in Fig. 10. The NEA review of Grenthe et al. (2021) includes recommended data for UO 2 (cr) but this is not included in the NEA TDB-e database. Although the THEREDA database only includes UO 2 (am), it also includes a Na 2 U 2 O 7 . H 2 O phase which can precipitate over a wide range of conditions and so limit U solubility (Endrizzi et al., 2019). The response to increasing pH (Fig. 10(b)) is generally not much change below pH 6 but increasing U solubility above pH 7. The detailed response depends on the minerals present. The solubility can vary by several orders of magnitude between databases.</p>
        <p>The variation with increasing temperature is not surprisingly more variable (Fig. 10(c)). The NEA TDB-e database shows no variation because no mineral precipitates over the range of conditions considered; the Nagra/PSI database also shows no variation because there is no enthalpy data or analytical equation to describe the temperature dependence of metaschoepite solubility, the controlling phase. The JAEA database appears to be an outlier with declining solubility with increasing temperature. This reflects the negative enthalpy defined for the UO 2 (cr) and UO 2.25 (cr) phases. In general, the temperature dependence under these reducing conditions is poorly defined, reflecting the challenging experimental conditions required to obtain such data. Fig. 10 is for a CO 2 -free environment, but in oxidizing environments, the role of carbonate, and hence the role of PCO 2 and pH, is likely to be a critical factor in controlling dissolved U concentrations through its impact on sorption/desorption reactions. This can be demonstrated by calculating how the PCO 2 and pH control the dissolved U concentration for various U loadings (Fig. 11). In the absence of CO 2 (g) and carbonates, U sorption on ferrihydrite steadily reduces dissolved U concentrations in the pH range 3.5-7 (Fig. 11(a)). At higher pH's, concentrations plateau out and then increase (Lofts et al., 2015). This increase in the calculated dissolved U concentrations at high pH in the CO 2 -free case reflects the influence and stability of uranyl hydrolysis species which prevent sorption. A similar effect is seen with U(VI) sorption by kaolinite (Křepelová et al., 2006) and smectite (McKinley et al., 1995) in the absence of CO 2 (g). This is similar to the behaviour of Hg 2+ which also strongly hydrolyzes (Kinniburgh and Jackson, 1978).</p>
        <p>At the highest U loading (100 μmol/kg water), albeit still at very low U loadings and unexceptional Na concentrations, clarkeite (Na(UO 2 )O (OH)) precipitation occurs and prevents the U concentration from increasing. At atmospheric PCO 2 and ten times higher (Fig. 11(b),(c)), the role of carbonate dramatically reduces sorption above pH 7.5 and also inhibits clarkeite precipitation.</p>
        <p>These calculations demonstrate the effect that dissolved carbonate can have on dissolved U concentrations through its impact on sorption reactions, here exemplified by U sorption on ferrihydrite. In soils and sediments, the concentration of ferrihydrite and other sorbing minerals can be one or two orders of magnitude greater than the 1 g/kg water used in these calculations with a corresponding increase in the amount of sorption. The CO 2 -free calculations demonstrate that not only does U (VI) reduction have an impact on reducing dissolved U concentrations because of the precipitation of UO 2 (s) but also indirectly through its impact on the conversion of carbonate to methane and consequent loss of competitive effects.The precipitation of clarkeite (Na(UO 2 )O(OH)) and related minerals could also be affected.</p>
        <p>Selecting the set of possible minerals involved is often the most important decision that must be made when performing speciation calculations. This has to be guided by the environment being considered and any additional information about the type of minerals likely to be found or actually observed. For example, a comparison of measured and dissolved U concentrations for three lakes in U-enriched natural analogue sites by Giffaut et al. (2014) suggested that an amorphous variant of UO 2 (s) was controlling U concentrations at 10 -9 to 10 -7 M. Much recent evidence points increasingly to the importance and stability of a non-crystalline, biotically-reduced U(IV) component in U-rich environments such as roll-front deposits (Bhattacharyya et al., 2017). This might not necessarily be the case in other environments, e.g. freshwater aquifers, where dissolution rather than precipitation is occurring.</p>
        <p>Even for dissolution reactions, considerable extrapolation may be required. The thermodynamic data for uraninite dissolution has often necessarily been established experimentally at very low or very high pH and high Cl concentrations (Grenthe et al., 2021) since the extremely low dissolved U concentrations that uraninite can impose at near neutral pH's are well below the detection limit of present-day analytical techniques. In natural waters, the presence of small amounts of dissolved organic matter with bound U, or of colloidal material, could enhance the apparent uraninite solubility if not carefully excluded.</p>
        <p>In most environmental systems, such as natural waters, sediments, soils and aquifers, a wide variety of U minerals could play a role in controlling U concentrations. This includes interactions with most major ions as well as other trace elementsin mineralized or contaminated environments. The only way to know which interactions might be important is to calculate the speciation using a comprehensive thermodynamic database, such as PRODATA or ThermoChimie, and then to look carefully at the minerals that are precipitating, dissolving or have saturation indices close to or greater than zero. Of course, direct observation of the mineral species present provides the strongest evidence.</p>
        <p>Uranium(VI) reduction is a key process governing the mobility of U in the environment, the accumulation of U in ore bodies and the isotopic fractionation of U. The driving force for reduction in the natural environment is often the introduction of fresh organic matter combined with a mechanism for limiting oxygen transport such as waterlogging in soils or the deposition of an impermeable fine-grained layer in sediments. Reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) may be either abiotic or biotic (Borch et al., 2010). Some of the possible mechanisms include: (i) direct reduction by Fe 2+ in solution; (ii) reduction by iron minerals; (iii) bioreduction by various organisms, especially metal-reducing bacteria, and (iv) reduction by sulphides. We discuss these below.</p>
        <p>Thermodynamics, DFT calculations and limited experimental evidence support the pH-dependent homogeneous reduction of U(VI) by Fe 2+ in solution (Collins and Rosso, 2017;Du et al., 2011). Fig. 12(a) shows the calculated variation in U solubility in a mixture of UO 2 2+ and Fe 2+ as the pH increases and solids begin to precipitate. This results in a UO 2 solid phase somewhere between pH 4.5-8 depending on the solubility of the assumed solid UO 2 solid phase. The more insoluble the UO 2 (s) phase, the more it drives further reduction (Fig. 12(a)) and the lower the pH where UO 2 precipitation occurs. This is seen in the rapid decline of U(VI) concentrations above pH 7.5 when UO 2 (cr) precipitates, whereas if UO 2 (am) is formed, this begins at just below pH 8 but is much less dramatic and most of the U(VI) remains in solution even at high pH. Therefore, the extent of reduction is strongly dependent on the U(IV) solid formed (Stetten et al., 2018). Fe(OH) 2 (s) precipitation occurs at pH 8.0 reducing dissolved Fe 2+ concentrations in line with observations (Du et al., 2011). In more complex environments, including seawater, the presence of Ca and Mg leads to the formation of ternary Ca(Mg)-UO 2 -CO 3 species which hinder the reduction of U(VI) by Fe 2+ (Bender and Becker, 2020;Dewey et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Given the ubiquity of iron minerals in the environment and the redox-sensitive nature of Fe under moderately reducing conditions, it is not surprising that Fe minerals often play a key part in the redox chemistry of U (Belli and Taillefert, 2018;Massey et al., 2014a). There is an area in the Eh-pH diagram for Fe where goethite (α-FeOOH) (and other iron oxides) can co-exist with relatively high concentrations of Fe 2+ (Fig. 12(b)). This provides opportunities for the Fe 2+ -promoted surface catalysis of U(VI) reduction. Such a process has been demonstrated in the laboratory during the Fe 2+ -catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite (Boland et al., 2014) and possibly also following the sorption of U(VI) by colloidal hematite (Du et al., 2011;Liger et al., 1999). Adsorbed U can also be incorporated into other iron oxides during mineral transformations (Marshall et al., 2014;McBriarty et al., 2018) but incorporation into goethite is favoured over lepidocrocite (McBriarty et al., 2017). Above pH 8 and exposed to the atmosphere, Fe-CO 3 species become dominant in solution which combined with the similar dominance of aqueous U-CO 3 species and the possible precipitation of siderite (FeCO 3 ), are likely to hinder U(VI) reduction and even lead to reoxidation of U(IV) (Belli et al., 2015;Belli and Taillefert, 2018).</p>
        <p>In aerobic systems, sorption is likely to remain the preferred binding mechanism for U (Soltis et al., 2019). Unlike in solution, U(V) species can be stabilized in mineral structures and have been identified by XANES during various mineral redox transformations, e.g. during the Fe 2+ -catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite in the presence of U(VI) (Boland et al., 2014;Massey et al., 2014a). Massey et al. (2014a) suggest that U(V), rather than U(IV) or U(VI), is the major form of U incorporated into goethite during these transformations. Also following the coprecipitation of uranyl (VI) with FeCl 2 /FeCl 3 to form magnetite, U(V) was likely stabilized in octahedral sites of the magnetite (Pidchenko et al., 2017) and these inclusions have been shown to be isotopically heavy (Z. Pan et al., 2022). Molecular dynamics calculations also suggest that U(V) in octahedral coordination may substitute for structural Fe(III) during the transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite (Kerisit et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>U(VI) can be reduced by Fe(II)-containing minerals such as green rusts, magnetite, siderite and mackinawite. The coprecipitation of U(VI) with FeCl 2 to form magnetite has been studied in detail by a variety of nano-scale spectroscopic and microscopic techniques (Pan et al., 2020). This has indicated a sequence of events involving a surface-bound U(V) species and isotopic fractionation. The overall formation of a stable UO 2 (s) phase involved a sequence of transformations starting with sorption of U(VI) to the magnetite surface, then reduction to U(V) and (IV) species, production of UO 2 nanoparticles, self-assembly of these to strings or 'nanowires' and finally aggregation of these nanowires to UO 2 nanoclusters, all over a few weeks (Pan et al., 2020). Green rusts, a type of mixed Fe(II)/Fe(III) layered hydroxide formed naturally under reducing conditions, have also been found to readily reduce U(VI) to nanometer-sized UO 2 (s) of unknown solubility (O'Loughlin et al., 2003).</p>
        <p>The possible oxidation of solid-phase U(IV) by iron(III) minerals is also important. The oxidation of U(IV) in UO 2 (bio) by ferrihydrite produces dissolved Fe 2+ and U(VI) and the rate depends on the rate of UO 2 (bio) dissolution which in turn depends on the pH and HCO 3 concentration (Ginder-Vogel et al., 2010). Oxidation is fastest when the pH is far from neutral and for high HCO 3 concentrations.</p>
        <p>Uranium may be sorbed and precipitated by microorganisms under both reducing and oxidizing conditions. Lovley et al. (1991) were the first to show that dissimilatory Mn(IV) and Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms could gain energy by directly reducing U(VI) to insoluble U(IV). Bioreduction of U refers to the reduction of U(VI) to U(V) or U(IV) by a wide variety of microorganisms including SO 4 -and Fe-reducing bacteria (Abdelouas et al., 2000;Borch et al., 2010;Lovley and Phillips, 1992;Myers and Nealson, 1988), and is a feature that can now be confirmed by the identification of an isotopically-heavy U phase (Stylo et al., 2015). It is a key process that is used in in-situ bioremediation strategies for U-contaminated sites (Cerrato et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>Certain strains of bacteria that have evolved in U-contaminated environments such as mining waste have developed particularly efficient methods of binding U(VI) to cell walls and proteinaceous cell surfaces. Merroun et al. (2005) used EXAFS to study U binding by Bacillus sphaericus JG-A12 and found that the U was bound in a bidentate fashion to carboxyl groups and in a monodentate fashion to phosphate groups.</p>
        <p>Under reducing conditions, the U can be precipitated both within the periplasm and outside the cell often as very fine-grained (&lt;2 nm diameter) uraninite particles or some form of sorbed U attached to mineral surfaces or organic matter (Alessi et al., 2012;Cerrato et al., 2013;Stetten et al., 2018). EXAFS often indicates shorter U-U distances (3.80 Å) than in bulk uraninite (3.87 Å), implying a possible displacement of surface U(IV) ions (Suzuki et al., 2002) or a non-uraninite source. Phosphate may play a crucial role since a U(IV)-phosphate species may be formed (Boyanov et al., 2011), possibly involving a polymerized phosphate polymer or even the mineral ningyoite, CaU (PO 4 ) 2 (Alessi et al., 2014b). A variety of techniques including XANES analyses point to a U(V) intermediate species in the reduction by the versatile microorganism Shewanella oneidensis MR1 (Vettese et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>As shown above, the reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) is usually accompanied by a dramatic reduction in U solubility. This bioreduction of U in the environment takes place against a background of the redox transformations of major components especially those of C, N, Fe, Mn and S and not surprisingly, both Fe-and SO 4 -reducing bacteria are often found to be taking part in these reactions. The role of major ions such as Ca 2+ and HCO 3 -are also important because of the stability and abundance of bio-unavailable ternary complexes such as Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 (Luo et al., 2007). The presence of nitrate (Borch et al., 2010) and phosphate (Cerrato et al., 2013) can also hinder the formation of UO 2 (s). Laboratory experiments have followed many of these transformations in detail while field experiments, often involving the addition of a C-source such as acetate to stimulate reduction, have been undertaken with a view to monitoring the reduction in U solubility. As with mineral weathering, bioreduction rates are strongly scaledependent with rates measured in the laboratory being several orders of magnitude faster than those measured in the field (Bao et al., 2014). This reflects the averaging effect of mixed microbial cultures in the field compared with laboratory experiments where the most effective microbes are favoured. There is also extensive mixing in laboratory systems which facilitates access of the biostimulant to the principal terminal electron acceptor such as Fe(III) oxides (Li et al., 2011). There could even be a form of microbe-induced 'self-sealing' whereby biofouling preferentially reduces flow through formerly active reduction zones. This sealing is likely to be more significant for field observations compared with constant-flow laboratory conditions (Komlos et al., 2008). It has been modelled successfully (Li et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>The overall effect of this bioreduction on U solubility and transport depends not only on the extent of bioreduction but also the concentration of ligands capable of keeping U(IV) in solution including bicarbonate (Long et al., 2015), low-molecular-weight organic acids such as citrate (Francis and Dodge, 2008) and fulvic acids. Francis and Dodge (2008) found that while Clostridia sp. could reduce dinuclear U (VI)-citrate to a mononuclear U(IV) citrate, the microorganisms did not metabolize the citrate itself reflecting the unavailability of the tridentate citrate ligand. The impact of NOM is particularly complex because it can both stimulate reduction and reoxidation of U as well as strongly binding U(IV) and U(VI) in either a solid or soluble phase (Gu et al., 2005). Colloidal transport of such organic complexes as well as colloidal-sized uraninite particles are also possible complications (Suzuki et al., 2002).</p>
        <p>Although the principal role of organic matter in uranium reduction is to initiate the microbial processes that lead to the consumption of oxygen and nitrate, the remaining organic matter, including HA and FA, are themselves redox-active through their electron-donating phenolic moieties and electron-accepting quinone moieties. Light-sensitive redox reactions may also be relevant for dissolved organic matter in lakewater. HA/FA can therefore operate as a limited redox buffer and as an electron shuttle between microorganisms and redox reactions including those of U reduction. This overall capacity can be measured by redox titration (Kappler et al., 2004;Peretyazhko and Sposito, 2006). A variety of humic substances have electron-donating and electron-accepting capacities on the order of 1-2 mol/kg under near-neutral conditions (Aeschbacher et al., 2012). Reiller (2005) estimated that U(VI) is reduced to U(IV) by 100 mg/L HA suspensions when Eh ≤ -20 mV.</p>
        <p>Uranium(VI) can be rapidly reduced abiotically by sulphide in solution and by sulphide minerals such as pyrite (FeS 2 ) (Wersin et al., 1994) and mackinawite (FeS). The rate of reduction is inhibited by dissolved carbonate at millimolar concentrations, especially at high pH (Hua et al., 2006), and also by the formation of uranyl carbonates and ternary Ca-U-CO 3 complexes. This retardation is likely to account for the lack of U(VI) reduction in modern anoxic waters such as those of the Cariaco Basin and Black Sea (Hua et al., 2006;Stewart et al., 2007). It can also lead to U isotope fractionation (Brown et al., 2016). 7.10. Transport of uranium 7.10.1. Mechanisms Many aspects of U chemistry in the environment involve the transport of U, whether it is at the molecular scale, across cell membranes, or at the aquifer scale. Many of the same principles apply at these different scales: transport can be either by movement along electrochemical gradients as with diffusion, or be carried by convection along pressure gradients following the mass flow of water. Diffusive transport can even be important in aquifers, for example, by transferring solutes between fissures and pores.</p>
        <p>Convective transport of solutes is controlled by the amount of time the solute spends in the water flow rather than adsorbed to a stationary particle surface or precipitated as a mineral. The solid/solution partition coefficient, K d , determines the former and the mineral solubility the latter. This is why the chemical speciation outlined above is important. A recurring theme from both field observations and laboratory experiments is the important role of U(IV) to U(VI) oxidation combined with carbonate complexationin mobilizing U. Hostetler and Garrels (1962) were the first to appreciate the importance of U-CO 3 species in U transport in aquifers. These species are now known to be primarily either U-CO 3 or U-Ca/Mg-CO 3 complexes (Section 7.4). The buildup of dissolved carbonate is therefore a key process. This is controlled by microbial activity in the soil followed by weathering reactions and evaporation. Carbonate concentrations are usually measured in groundwaters by acid titration and recorded as the alkalinity. In alkaline groundwaters, the alkalinity is made up primarily of the bicarbonate ion (HCO 3 -) with a small amount of carbonate (CO 3 2-) at high pH plus a minor contribution from other weak acids including borate, phosphate and DOM.</p>
        <p>The overall role that these reactions play in controlling U transport can be seen through their effect on the uranyl activity in solution and the K d in a system with a U-adsorbing solid. This is demonstrated in Fig. 13 which shows the impact of changing the total alkalinity and pH in a simple U-NaCl-Ca-Fhy system on uranyl activity and the K d . The uranyl activity is reduced by many orders of magnitude by the complexation (Fig. 13(a)). Even at pH 8 and a typical groundwater alkalinity of 10 -2.5 eq/kg water (3.1 meq/L or ca. 180 mg HCO 3 /L), the uranyl activity is approximately 10 -15 for a total U concentration of 10 -6 mol/kg water, or a decrease by about a factor of 10 -9 . It steadily decreases even further with both increasing pH and alkalinity. This impacts on the sorption of U as seen in the variation of the K d (Fig. 13(b)) which shows the K d varying by 5 orders of magnitude. This varies in a more complex way than the uranyl activity since ternary Fhy-U-CO 3 surface complexes are formed. The transformation from a strongly sorbed, immobile species at low pH and low alkalinity to a weakly sorbed and mobile species at high pH and high alkalinity is clear.</p>
        <p>Sorption is at a maximum between pH 6 and 8 with log K d values of 6-7, signifying very strong sorption, similar to that obtained with synthetic amidoxime-based polymers (Aguila et al., 2019;Sun et al., 2018). Estimates of log K d 's for montmorillonite are also maximal (5.1) near pH 7, dropping to about 4.1 at pH 10 and in the absence of CO 2 (Zhang et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>Laboratory measurements of the log K d for γ-alumina (131 m 2 /g) are more than two orders of magnitude lower (ca. 1.6 at pH 4.45) (Guo et al., 2009). The log K d of soils reflects their constituent components. In one study, the log K d of organic soils was the highest (3.1), loams intermediate (2.5) and sands (2.1) and clays (1.1) the lowest (Vandenhove et al., 2009), generally following the trend noted by Sheppard et al. (2006). Measured log K d 's for a range of uncontaminated freshwater sediments showed a maximum log K d in the range 3.0-4.2 at pH 6-7 with a significant reduction at higher pH (Crawford et al., 2017). Another study of 25 sandy sediments from Virginia, USA, showed that log K d varied from 0.5 to 2.9 with an increase of roughly 0.47 per pH unit (Rosentreter et al., 1998). These partition coefficients show that the movement of U in soils and sediments is normally several orders of magnitude slower than that of the mass flow of water.</p>
        <p>Transport experiments at laboratory or field scale can be used to infer interaction factors such as the K d and reaction kinetics (Avasarala et al., 2017; Curtis et al., 2006;Dangelmayr et al., 2017Dangelmayr et al., , 2018;;Hou et al., 2021;Mehta et al., 2015;Nitzsche and Merkel, 1999). Although transport in aquifers is generally slow, and over long timescales, it can separate elements as in a chromatography column. Ultimately, this can lead to ore bodies such as roll fronts (Section 5.1, 8.1). The transport of U away from contaminated sites and potential waste repositories is also of great interest and many studies have been undertaken to try to predict the magnitude of this movement (Avasarala et al., 2017;Hennig et al., 2020;Seigneur et al., 2021) and to devise approaches to minimize it, such as permeable reactive barriers (Henderson and Demond, 2007). The transport of U at many contaminated sites, e.g. Hanford, USA have been studied extensively (Section 8.6).</p>
        <p>In the application of ISL, transport of U needs to be maximized (Abzalov, 2012) (Section 5.1). Chemical speciation plays an important role here too. Acid leaching (H 2 SO 4 ) used in sandstone formations with a low carbonate content involves the injection of native groundwater mixed with a substantial quantity of acid into the host formation, potentially with addition of an oxidant (e.g. O 2 (g) or H 2 O 2 ). This promotes the dissolution of U minerals such as pitchblende and coffinite. Strong complexes are formed with SO 4 which reduce U sorption and so increase transport to the collector sites. Where carbonates are present, the acid required would be excessive and an alkaline (Na 2 CO 3 ) leach solution can be used. Here, the high pH and large concentration of dissolved CO 3 2-aids transport by minimizing sorption. These conditions also reduce the undesired dissolution of gangue minerals. Various reactive-transport models have been used to analyse these processes and to aid the planning of post-mining restoration when the transport must be reduced (Lagneau et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>The role of colloids in facilitating the transport of U and other highly insoluble radionuclides has long been a major concern for regulatory agencies responsible for the containment of sites contaminated with radioelements. This was highlighted by a study of Pu migration from the underground nuclear test site in Nevada. This showed that low levels of Pu had migrated 1.3 km downgradient from the test site over about 40 years when conventional wisdom suggested that dissolved Pu concentrations were too low to account for this (Kersting et al., 1999). In this case, various mineral colloids were implicated, but organic 'colloids' are also of concern. Transport of actinides associated with colloids has also been implicated at the Savannah River nuclear materials processing site in South Carolina, USA (Kaplan et al., 1994).</p>
        <p>Simply having colloids transported in the groundwater flow is not sufficient to ensure enhanced transport since if equilibrium with the surrounding environment is maintained, the excess U will eventually be stripped from any U-laden colloid. This has been demonstrated in laboratory column experiments with Am-laden bentonite colloids (Dittrich et al., 2015). The extent of any facilitated transport will depend on many factors including the strength of binding, the ratio of mobile/immobile binding capacity (Crançon and Van der Lee, 2003;Emerson et al., 2016;Kretzschmar et al., 1999;Mibus et al., 2007) and the kinetics and reversibility of the binding (Yang et al., 2013). There can also be physical factors at play such as fracture flow, particle filtration, colloid stability, and in the unsaturated zone, attachment to the air-water interface (Flury and Qiu, 2008).</p>
        <p>Intermontane basins of Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska, USA, range in size up to several thousand square kilometres and contain continental sediments of Cenozoic to Quaternary age (Dahlkamp, 2010). The basins host a number of economic-grade U roll-front deposits and the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming also hosts tabular U deposits. The deposits lend themselves to U extraction by ISL (ISR) and five ISL plants operated across the region until recent closures. The U deposits are aligned parallel to the groundwater flow direction, though may crosscut bedding; original U sources in the commonly arkosic sandstone are inferred to be proximal or parental granitic and rhyolitic volcanic rocks (Bullock and Parnell, 2017;Dahlkamp, 2010;Seeland, 1976;Wolde-Gabriel et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>The mineralogy of the roll fronts characteristically changes downgradient, with partial or complete destruction of pyrite and magnetite and smaller contents of organic matter and calcite in the upgradient oxidized zone. Downgradient of the roll front, two generations of pyrite commonly exist, comprising a diagenetic form derived from biogenic reactions, and pyrite in the mineralized zones related to ore formation. The U occurs typically as coffinite and pitchblende, along with less common coconinoite, tyuyamunite, torbernite and autunite (Table 4). A biogenic, non-crystalline form of U(IV) has also been identified (Bhattacharyya et al., 2017). Uranium minerals occur as grain coatings, interstitial infills and replacements of organic carbon. Other trace elements can also occur, for example, native selenium or ferroselite on the concave upgradient side of the roll front, and molybdenite on the convex downgradient side (Dahlkamp, 2010).</p>
        <p>The Smith Ranch-Highland plant in the southern Powder River Basin of eastern Wyoming is a former ISL U plant and mine complex, which when active constituted the largest U facility in the USA. The site consists of two mines which were operated together, and a single processing plant. Ore grades at the complex are about 0.10% U 3 O 8 (Cameco, 2021). The method of U extraction involved pumping groundwater into the aquifer with addition of O 2 and Na-HCO 3 or H 2 SO 4 and pumping dissolved U back to the surface for processing into yellowcake (U oxide) (Dangelmayr et al., 2017). The operator suspended operations at the Smith Ranch plant in 2018, citing mainly market conditions (Cameco, 2021). Current activities at the complex are focused on site restoration (Dangelmayr et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>The roll-front U deposits at the Smith Ranch site (Fig. 14) occur in fluvial sandstones of the Paleocene Fort Union Formation and sandstones of the Eocene Wasatch Formation (Seeland, 1976). The sandstone units are rich in organic carbon and pyrite and are intercalated with fluvial or lacustrine silt, clay and coal deposits (Dahlkamp, 2010). The Powder River Basin is bordered to the south by the Laramie Mountains, to the west by the Big Horn Mountains and to the east by the Black Hills. Basal Palaeocene deposits are dominantly argillaceous but later Palaeocene deposits include intercalations of arkosic sandstone derived from erosion of the crystalline rocks of the Laramie range. Subsidence during the late Palaeocene to early Eocene resulted in deposition of fluvial deposits, and swamps produced coal deposits. The Eocene Wasatch Formation shows sedimentary cycles alternating from coarse fluvial sandstone to finer deposits (Seeland, 1976).</p>
        <p>The sandstone deposits of the Smith Ranch-Highland complex dip gently eastwards (&lt;0.5 • ) with eastwards groundwater flow (Brown et al., 2016). The U mineral accumulation at the redox front (up to 25, 000 mg/kg) (WoldeGabriel et al., 2014) is of the order of 2-8 m wide in an arcuate form in cross section, over a depth range of 61-366 m (4 km study area).</p>
        <p>Groundwater samples upgradient of the redox front were reported to have U concentrations of 11-16 μg/L and of 5-17 μg/L, mostly &lt;10 μg/ L, downgradient. Concentrations at the roll front mineralized zone were 13,000-40,000 μg/L. The higher concentrations in the ore zone were taken to be due to residual oxidation and complexation of U with CO (Brown et al., 2016). Brown et al. (2016) investigated the U isotopic compositions of groundwater across the redox front at the Smith Ranch site and noted a 3‰ drop in the 238 U/ 235 U ratio (δ 238 U -0.88 to -1.08‰ upgradient, -0.41 to -0.15‰ in the ore zone and -1.5 to -2.8‰ downgradient), corresponding with the decrease in U concentration beyond the front. Activity ratios of 234 U/ 238 U were 5.12-5.61 in the upgradient oxic zone and taken to be controlled by the balance between 234 U release by alpha recoil and U release by silicate weathering. Ratios were around 1.0 in the ore zone, and between 2.3 and 3.7 further downgradient. The variation in U isotopic ratios across the roll front was inferred to be indicative of reduction of U(VI) to U(IV), either enzymatically by microbes or in combination with an abiotic reduction process (Brown et al., 2016). Distributions of other analytes, including dissolved Fe and SO 4 , supported the evidence for redox reactions across the roll front. The authors used the spatial distributions of the changing 234 U/ 238 U ratio to estimate the degree to which U is transported downgradient of the ore body.</p>
        <p>Uranium deposits of the Alligator Rivers field of Northern Territory, Australia, some 220 km east of Darwin, are of unconformity-type. The field is highly prospective and includes the Ranger, Koongarra, Jabiluka and Nabarlek U deposits (Raffensperger and Garven, 1995). At all sites where previous mining took place, activities have now ceased, though some rehabilitation works remain. The Koongarra deposit has a U 3 O 8 grade of 0.8%. It is perhaps the most studied U deposit in the region, having been adopted especially during the 1980s and 1990s as a natural analogue site for assessing the safety of radioactive waste disposal (Payne and Airey, 2006). Koongarra was never mined and in 2013, protection of the site was secured when it became part of the Kakadu National Park World Heritage area.</p>
        <p>The unconformity at Koongarra separates steeply-dipping early Proterozoic metasediments of the Cahill Formation from middle Proterozoic sediments of the Kombolgie Formation (Fig. 15). The Cahill Formation itself overlies Archaean granite and granite-gneiss (Komninou and Sverjensky, 1995). The Cahill Formation is composed of brecciated amphibolite facies metasediments, including a lower carbonaceous partly graphitic schist, passing upwards into feldspathic schist. The overlying Kombolgie Formation consists of terrestrial sandstone and conglomerate deposits, including some evaporite, with interbedded volcanic rocks. The mineralization age is inferred as around 1.6 Ga, shortly after the deposition of the Kombolgie Formation (Komninou and Sverjensky, 1995;Maas, 1989). Formation of the U deposits is likely to have involved reaction of hot, oxidizing, U-bearing fluids from the Kombolgie Formation with reducing metasediments of the Cahill Formation (Maas, 1989).</p>
        <p>Pre-ore hydrothermal alteration of the type observed in the Koongarra unconformity-related U deposit is demonstrated by chloritization of metamorphic minerals (Komninou and Sverjensky, 1995). Syn-ore mineralization involved subsequent more intense alteration around breccia zones, veins and the unconformity itself. This involved formation of chlorite, hematite and phengitic white mica, along with uraninite (Maas, 1989).</p>
        <p>Primary uraninite ore occurs as lenses below the weathered zone at around 25-30 m depth to around 100 m depth (Fig. 15). Secondary U minerals occur in a 'dispersion fan' as a result of oxidation of the primary uraninite and mobilization probably as U(VI)-carbonate complexes, before redeposition in the fan as uranyl adsorbed to iron oxides, clays and possibly Al oxides, and subsequently as uranyl phosphates (Payne and Airey, 2006;Yanase et al., 1991). The age of the secondary deposits in the fan has been placed around 1-1.5 Ma (Payne and Airey, 2006).</p>
        <p>Saléeite (Mg(UO 2 ) 2 (PO 4 ) 2 ⋅10H 2 O) is the dominant secondary mineral in the upgradient oxic section of the Koongarra deposit, where it replaces the secondary mineral sklodowskite (Mg (UO 2 ) 2 (SiO 3 OH) 2 ⋅6H 2 O) and apatite. Within and downgradient of the deposit, saléeite and metatorbernite (Cu(UO 2 PO 4 )( 2 ).8H 2 O) occur as microcrystals in veins of hematite and goethite (Murakami et al., 1997(Murakami et al., , 2005)). The microcrystals likely originate from U and PO 4 released from ferrihydrite on aging (Murakami et al., 1997).</p>
        <p>EXAFS investigations of uranyl sorption onto ferrihydrite from Koongarra showed uranyl occurred as a mononuclear bidentate surface complex. Best-fit modelling required a ternary uranyl-carbonate on both weak and strong surface sites (Waite et al., 1994). More crystalline oxides (goethite, hematite) showed decreased U affinity compared to ferrihydrite although some U is likely transformed into the crystalline phases during the aging process (Ohnuki et al., 1997).</p>
        <p>Uranium concentrations across the ore body vary from &lt;1 μg/L in groundwater from the Kombolgie Formation upstream, to 440 μg/L in the central part of the ore body, to &lt;1 μg/L some 200 m downstream (Fig. 16) (Payne, 1991). 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios in easily extractable secondary phases (Fe oxides, clays) from the Koongarra deposit were below 1.0 in the shallow (&lt;20 m) weathered zone and were similar to values in the circulating shallow groundwaters (Fig. 16). By contrast, activity ratios in resistate minerals (quartz) were above 1.0, as were many of the deeper groundwaters (&gt;30 m) (Payne and Airey, 2006;Yanase et al., 1995). The reasons for the variation and secular disequilibrium are unclear, but values greater than 1.0 in groundwater have been variously attributed to damage to the mineral structure, location of daughter atoms on weakly bound sites, oxidation of U(IV) to U(VI) during alpha decay resulting in enhanced mobility, or alpha recoil (Payne and Airey, 2006;Yanase et al., 1995).</p>
        <p>The low 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios (&lt;1.0) in the shallow groundwaters have been inferred as possibly favoured in unsaturated conditions, where daughter 234 U is thought more likely to vacate the pore space and enter into a mineral (Yanase et al., 1995). An alternative explanation for the low ratios is sorption of short-lived daughter 234 Th to clay or ferrihydrite, with subsequent fixation to the mineral on decay to 234 U. The low activity ratio from the deeper groundwater from borehole PH88 may be due to localized more deep weathering (Fig. 16) (Yanase et al., 1995).</p>
        <p>The Oklo, Okélobondo and Bangombé group of U deposits in the Republic of Gabon, West Africa, are the only known examples of natural nuclear fission. At the sites, uraninite ore occurs as discrete lenses within Lower Proterozoic (2.3 Ga) sandstone. Aged around 2 Ga, these are the earliest redox-controlled sandstone-hosted deposits in the world (Cuney, 2010). Known as natural reactors, the ore deposits have anomalously low 235 U activities (0.62% compared to natural 0.72%) and the isotopic ratios of some other elements are also perturbed (Miller et al., 2000). Before 2 Ga, natural U would have had a larger abundance of 235 U, around 3.7%. The deposits post-date the GOE (around 2.4 Ga) when surface conditions on earth became gradually more oxidizing (Andersen et al., 2017) and where U was mobilized and redistributed. This allowed greater concentrations to accumulate (up to 60% U) on reduction and redeposition in organic-rich sediments higher in the rock strata (Miller et al., 2000). Accumulation of U was sufficient to achieve radioactive criticality (sufficient critical mass that each fission releases sufficient neutrons to sustain ongoing nuclear reactions) and over the following hundreds of thousands of years, host rocks were then subjected to fission as well as radioactive decay. Natural radioactive decay reduced the 235 U to &lt;3% of the total by 1.7 Ga, and conditions for natural fission have not existed on earth since then.</p>
        <p>The ore bodies consist of a central core of uraninite and outer aureole of uraninite, coffinite and pitchblende. The heat of nuclear reactions led to hydrothermal alteration with the formation of outer zones enriched in illite and chlorite. Temperatures would have been up to 600 • C and pressures up to 30-40 MPa (Miller et al., 2000). Criticality stopped when 235 U eventually diminished. Over the long time period since then, most transuranic fission products have decayed to small amounts. Radioactive daughters such as plutonium remain immobilized at the locations.</p>
        <p>The Okélobondo uraninite deposit occurs at about 300 m depth.</p>
        <p>Groundwater at this depth is oxic and alkaline (pH 7.0-8.5) and U concentrations are reported in the range 0.32-332 μg/L. Shallow groundwater at the site has lower concentrations as it occurs in association with black shale and is more reducing (Salas and Ayora, 2004). The Oklo mine complex closed in the 1990s and is now flooded.</p>
        <p>Groundwater from the semi-arid northern La Pampa Province of central Argentina has neutral to alkaline pH, is overwhelmingly oxic, is mainly of Na-HCO 3 or Na-mixed-anion composition, and commonly contains high concentrations of U (up to 250 μg/L), along with high alkalinity (up to 1440 mg/L as HCO 3 ), variable but often high salinity (SEC up to 17.5 mS/cm) and with high concentrations of a number of dissolved anion and oxyanion species (e.g. F up to 29 mg/L, V up to 5.4 mg/L, As up to 5300 μg/L, Mo up to 990 μg/L). The groundwater is hosted by a Quaternary loess aquifer which is dominated by silt and fine sand and which contains a component of Andean rhyolitic volcanic ash as disseminated or thin discrete layers. The loess deposits also contain secondary calcium carbonate as calcrete layers, nodules or cements (Smedley et al., 2002). High groundwater alkalinity is inferred to be due to silicate hydrolysis (weathering) reactions with carbonate equilibrium and likely some ion exchange. High concentrations of U as well as As, V and F are related to the oxic and alkaline conditions, sources including volcanic ash, and poor sorption of these elements to metal oxides in the loess deposits (Smedley et al., 2002(Smedley et al., , 2005)).</p>
        <p>Uranium concentrations in the groundwater show poor correlations with pH, Eh and salinity (e.g. Na) (Fig. 17), but better positive correlations with alkalinity (HCO 3 ), P, As and Mo. The relationship with Ca is weak and if anything negative. Modelling (PHREEQC with the PRO-DATA database and Davies activity model) suggests that dissolved U is present in the groundwaters predominantly as UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 4-species, although the few samples at the low end of the pH range are dominated by UO 2 (HPO 4 ) 2 2-. Model results do not find predominant Ca(Mg) ternary complexes. La Pampa Province forms part of the Chaco-Pampean Plain, a vast 1 million km 2 area of Argentina with similar superficial geology and hydrogeochemical features. Groundwater As problems in the region are well-documented (Martinez and Carrillo-Rivera, 2006;Nicolli et al., 2012b, Nicolli et al., 1989). Associated high concentrations of U are often also recorded but with much less emphasis on studying their distributions and controls.</p>
        <p>Relatively high concentrations of U in the Platte River system of Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming (average 24 μg/L) are attributed to weathering of U-rich rocks in the Front Range and Laramie Mountains (Snow and Spalding, 1994). Samples of river water collected at different times under different rainfall conditions along the stretch have a concentration range of 0.27-31.7 μg/L and 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios showing varying degrees of disequilibrium from 1.03 to 1.72. Both concentrations and ratios were generally higher under low-flow (baseflow) conditions. From one round of sampling, Snow and Spalding (1994) found concentrations of U of 22.8 and 31.7 μg/L in the North and South Platte Rivers respectively, decreasing downstream beyond the confluence along the Platte River, a distance of some 600 km.</p>
        <p>Groundwater from private wells in the Platte River valley of Nebraska had groundwater U concentrations in the range 0.3-99.3 μg/L, though concentrations up to 550 μg/L have been reported for the valley alluvium (Snow and Spalding, 1994). Wells close to the Platte River system derive a contribution of their U from river water via irrigation. At times of low river flow, the alluvial aquifer returns U-bearing irrigation water back to the river forming a semi-closed loop. The contribution of U from phosphate fertilizers is thought to be negligible (Snow and Spalding, 1994).</p>
        <p>A range of chemical and isotopic tools used to investigate groundwaters from the alluvial aquifer of the North Platte River valley (Dutch Flats area) also pointed to a significant influence of surface-water irrigation on groundwater compositions (Böhlke et al., 2007). Uranium concentrations in the groundwater were 9.52-19.0 μg/L and 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios 1.4-1.8. Each was similar to river water and local canal water compositions. Enriched 234 U indicating disequilibrium conditions, suggested a U origin from mineral reactions rather than phosphate fertilizer, which might have contributed a ratio closer to equilibrium (Zielinski et al., 1997). Böhlke et al. (2007) concluded that large quantities of U with low 234 U/ 238 U ratios (1.4-1.8) were present in the alluvial aquifer as a result of irrigation with U-bearing river water, alongside smaller amounts of U with higher 234 U/ 238 U activity ratios (closer to 2), contributed from underlying volcanic-rich and alluvial sediments.</p>
        <p>The high U uranium concentrations in groundwater and the effects of recycling of irrigation flows in the Platte River valley of Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska are easily picked out as the east-west-trending line (U &gt; 30 μg/L) on the USGS U map produced from the NAWQA data sets (Ayotte et al., 2011) (Fig. 18).</p>
        <p>The DOE Hanford nuclear site, Washington, USA, hosts some 210 million litres of hazardous nuclear waste, the largest such site in the world. The waste was produced as a result of weapons processing for World War II and the Cold War over the period 1943-1989(Reynolds et al., 2018;;Um et al., 2009); U forms a substantial component of the waste. The 1500 km 2 site consists of distinct areas which hosted different processing activities and had differing waste streams (McKinley et al., 2007). In the 200 Area in the central part of the site, U-bearing alkaline (pH around 10) liquid waste and sludge has been stored in 177 underground tanks, several of which have leaked over the lifetime of the operations (Christensen et al., 2010;Zachara et al., 2013). In the 300 Area to the south of the site, both strongly alkaline (sodium aluminate) and acidic (copper uranyl nitrate) solutions were released to surface process ponds, which over their lifetime had pH values ranging between 1.8 and 11.4, leaching from which also contributed to the site groundwater and river water contamination plume (Stubbs et al., 2009;Zachara et al., 2013). Restoration works have been ongoing since production ceased, including pre-2004 removal of a surface layer of heavily contaminated sediment at 300 Area to reduce contaminant loads to groundwater. (1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003). Colour washes denote principal aquifers and stipple denotes distribution of glacial unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers (from Ayotte et al., 2011), with permission; also available at http://pubs.usgs.gov/ sir/2011/5059).</p>
        <p>The Hanford site sits on the floodplain of the Columbia River and is underlain by Pleistocene fluvioglacial sands and gravels and Pliocene fluviolacustrine deposits, above Miocene Columbia River Basalt (Gartman et al., 2015;McKinley et al., 2007). The Pleistocene sediments form an unconfined aquifer and host the U contaminant plume. The 200 Area has a thick unsaturated zone with groundwater level about 60-80 m below surface; the 300 Area is proximal to the Columbia River with a thinner unsaturated zone.</p>
        <p>The mineral associations of the contaminant U vary spatially. In the 300 Area, contaminated surface sediments that had been removed as part of site remediation contained U coprecipitated with calcite. Remaining underlying sediments contain metatorbernite, cuprosklodowskite (Cu(UO 2 ) 2 (SiO 4 )(H 3 O) 2 ⋅2H 2 O), and U adsorbed to phyllosilicates including chlorite and metal oxides (Catalano et al., 2006;Stubbs et al., 2009). In the 200 East tank farm Area, secondary boltwoodite and uranophane have been found at 15-16 m depth, adsorbed U(VI) phases and polynuclear U(VI) surface precipitates at 20-25 m depth, with only natural U in granite lithic fragments present within the sediment at &gt;28 m depth. Adsorbed forms were found to be more mobile than these mineral hosts (McKinley et al., 2006;Um et al., 2009).</p>
        <p>Hanford shallow groundwater is oxic and dissolved U is present as U (VI). Concentrations around 18-205 mg/L have been recorded in the 300 Area with HCO 3 of 150-230 mg/L, SEC up to 500 μS/cm and pH of 7.1-8.7 (Zachara et al., 2013). Uranium concentrations up to 524 μg/L were reported from the site by Dresel et al. (2002). Aqueous species are dominated by UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 4-with a smaller proportion of Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 (Wang et al., 2004). Groundwater U concentration increases with spring recharge as the water level rises and U is mobilized from the contaminated lower unsaturated zone beneath surface sites. Slow site remediation has been attributed to slow desorption of U held within micropores and grain fractures in the aquifer sediments and diffusive release to groundwater (Zachara et al., 2013). Desorption is also dependent on the aqueous HCO 3 concentration and pH which vary according to the extent of groundwater-river interaction (Um et al., 2007). Small mass loss of U (VI) to the Columbia River is also noted as a factor. This has been attributed to the complex topography of the Pleistocene base of the aquifer, restricting flow to the river, and complex changes in river-groundwater flow directions in response to river stage (Zachara et al., 2013). Diverse mineral associations with differing U(VI) solubilities also play a large role in prolonging U release to aqueous solution and removal from the system.</p>
        <p>The above accounts of U occurrence in water and the environment demonstrate the predominant controls on its speciation and mobility. While some natural high-U occurrences clearly exist in all water types, they are uncommon in surface waters and generally restricted to areas of U mineralization and alkaline lakes. They also have limited concentrations in marine water. Uranium concentrations appreciably above the WHO provisional guideline value of 30 μg/L are also unusual in groundwater as U(VI) is readily sorbed to metal oxides, clays and NOM and U(IV) is also strongly immobilized by reduction with precipitation or sorption. However, a large and growing number of documented occurrences indicate the types of environment where high dissolved U concentrations are most likely to occur. These natural occurrences and their dominant features are outlined below; occurrences with an anthropogenic control (nuclear processing, munitions and other contaminated land) are not included. Factors producing current high-U groundwaters have many overlaps with the recognized processes that mobilized (and immobilized) U during the creation of ore deposits albeit with lower intensity.</p>
        <p>Many of the documented occurrences have been reported in groundwater from granites, granite-gneisses and felsic volcanic rocks. These are rocks with a relatively high Si content, including an abundance of feldspars. These have relatively large U contents (up to around 70 mg/kg) compared to many other rock types (typical 1-4 mg/kg), with U residing in primary minerals such as monazite, apatite, ilmenite, magnetite and zircon, potentially micas and amphiboles, and in their alteration products including clay minerals (Section 3.1). Some contain uraninite. Documented examples of high-U groundwater from these sources include parts of peninsular India, USA, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Burundi and South Korea (Andrews et al., 1989;Cho and Choo, 2019;Coyte et al., 2019;Gross and Brown, 2020;Lapworth et al., 2021;Linhoff et al., 2016;Papageorgiou et al., 2022;Post et al., 2017;Prat et al., 2009;Warner et al., 2011;Wathen, 1987). Alkaline rhyolites have been inferred as a source of U in groundwater from Mongolia (Linhoff et al., 2011) and rhyolitic ashes as the ultimate source in groundwater from volcanogenic sediments in Argentina and Ethiopia (Nicolli et al., 2012a;Rango et al., 2010;Smedley et al., 2002). Ultimately, granitic rocks and their volcanic equivalents are the sources of all terrestrial U.</p>
        <p>Common features of the high-U groundwaters in such bedrock terrains are typically oxic conditions, often but not always with associated high salinity, and high alkalinity (HCO 3 ). Indeed, a positive correlation between dissolved U and HCO 3 concentrations is one of the most commonly observed relationships (e.g. Cho and Choo, 2019;Matteoda et al., 2019;Warner et al., 2011). These oxic, alkaline waters also commonly have associated increased concentrations of other anion and oxyanion-forming species (e.g. F, As, V, Mo) (e.g. Rango et al., 2010). Increased salinity in some has been linked in part to evapotranspiration (Post et al., 2017). Although 222 Rn is a daughter in the 238 U decay chain, the correlations between dissolved U and dissolved Rn are typically poor because of the differing behaviour of the two elements, U being a reactive solute and Rn a dissolved gas.</p>
        <p>As the mobility of U is favoured in the neutral to alkaline pH range with dissolved carbonate species exerting a strong control, e.g. as UO 2 (CO 3 ) 2 2-, UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 4- (Cumberland et al., 2016), the ability to generate alkalinity in groundwater has a bearing on dissolved U concentrations. Silicate hydrolysis induced by weathering reactions and carbonate mineral reactions in aquifers can increase alkalinity and pH, especially where throughflow is limited.</p>
        <p>Uranium-rich groundwaters (&gt;30 μg/L) in the granitic aquifers of</p>
        <p>Rajasthan have pH values in the range 6.7-7.7 and high HCO 3 in the range 344-1690 mg/L (Coyte et al., 2018). The presence of Ca can also have an important influence because of the capacity to form U-Ca-CO 3 ternary complexes. These have reduced affinity for sorption to surfaces (Section 7.4). For example, the Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 0 complex is uncharged which limits sorption (Lopez et al., 2020); other anionic ternary complexes also enhance U mobility. Groundwater sampled from granite in southern Finland with U concentrations up to 3400 μg/L had pH values of 7.9-9.0 and HCO 3 of 67-216 mg/L; the dominant species were Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 0 and CaUO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 2- (Prat et al., 2009). In that study, the dominance of Ca-uranyl-carbonate complexes was considered an important factor in reducing the U toxicity of the groundwater. Groundwaters from granite-gneiss in Karnataka, India, are calcite-saturated (pH 6.3-7.5, HCO 3 200-500 mg/L), with Ca 2 UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 0 becoming the dominant U species (Lapworth et al., 2021). Although groundwaters in the Leinster granite of Ireland have UO 2 (CO 3 ) 2 2-and UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 4-as the dominant species, the highest U concentrations occurred where overlain by Quaternary limestone-bearing till (pH 7-8, HCO 3 30-70 mg/L). Calcite was considered to be an important control on mobilization (Papageorgiou et al., 2022). Also, gneiss and schist in the Yukon, Canada, was found to contribute more Ca alongside alkalinity (pH 7.6-8.4, HCO 3 50-608 mg/L) to groundwater than did granite, with higher dissolved U concentrations resulting from the formation of uranyl-Ca-carbonate ternary complexes (Skierszkan et al., 2020b).</p>
        <p>These observations contrast with those from the granite of southwest England which has groundwater with low pH (4.7-6.8) and HCO 3 (5.6-83 mg/L) concentrations due to absence of calcite and returns some relatively low observed concentrations of U (Fig. 5).</p>
        <p>Oxic and neutral to alkaline conditions are also a predominant feature of high-U groundwaters from sedimentary aquifers. These are typically continental alluvial, lacustrine or aeolian silicate aquifers; many though not all are of Cenozoic or Quaternary age. Examples are seen in the Quaternary alluvial aquifers of the Indo-Gangetic Basin, India and Pakistan (Coyte et al., 2018;Sahoo et al., 2022), the Cenozoic alluvial aquifers of the High Plains, USA (Nolan and Weber, 2015), Cenozoic-Quaternary alluvial/lacustrine aquifers of Central Valley, USA (Jurgens et al., 2010), Miocene alluvial/lacustrine aquifers of Española Basin, New Mexico, USA (Linhoff et al., 2016) and the Quaternary loess Chaco-Pampean aquifer of Argentina (Smedley et al., 2002). Some are extremely well-documented (e.g. the Ganga Basin of India), others less so (e.g. Indus Basin of Pakistan). Data can be sparse even for these aquifer types in developed countries, for example data for private wells in the USA (Vengosh et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>The ultimate sources of U in many of these sedimentary silicate aquifers are also likely to be granitic or felsic volcanic precursors, which would have formed an important component of the products of unroofing of large mountain massifs such as the Rocky Mountains which provided the sediments for the High Plains aquifer, USA, the Himalaya as the sources of the Indo-Gangetic Plain sediments of India and Pakistan and the Andes as the source of sediments and volcanic rocks of the Pampean Plain, Argentina. The high-U groundwaters typically occur in arid or semi-arid areas and some of the groundwaters have increased salinity, although many are major productive aquifers used for agriculture and many also contain high concentrations of NO 3 which is retained under the ambient oxic conditions (e.g. Nolan and Weber, 2015).</p>
        <p>As with the igneous aquifers, a correlation of U with HCO 3 is welldocumented in these groundwaters (Alkinani et al., 2016;Jurgens et al., 2010;Linhoff et al., 2016) and mobilization of U(VI) in oxic, alkaline conditions accounts for many of the documented occurrences (Fig. 4). Binary or ternary (with Ca) U-carbonate complexes are likely involved (e.g. Warner et al., 2011). Associations with other anion/oxyanion species (F, As, V, Mo) are also prevalent (Linhoff et al., 2016;Nicolli et al., 2012a;Smedley et al., 2002;Welch and Lico, 1998).</p>
        <p>Increased U concentrations have also been reported in groundwaters from such aquifers under Mn-reducing conditions. Reductive dissolution of metal oxides was inferred to explain some of the high U concentrations observed in groundwaters from the Carson Desert of Nevada, USA (Welch and Lico, 1998) where mildly reducing conditions were suggested from a number of the groundwaters having dissolved-oxygen concentrations &lt;1 mg/L and dissolved Mn concentrations up to 4 mg/L. Increased concentrations were also found in Mn-reducing groundwaters from Germany (Riedel and Kübeck, 2018). This may involve release of U(VI), known to sorb to MnO 2 surfaces (Brennecka et al., 2011), or redox interaction between UO 2 and MnO 2 (Wang et al., 2013b).</p>
        <p>As discussed in detail in Section 7, uranium is immobilized when reduced to U(IV), and in young alluvial aquifers, immobilization is observed under Fe-and SO 4 -reducing conditions such as are observed in the lower Bengal Basin of Bangladesh, Mekong delta of Vietnam and Cambodia and Yellow River Basin of China (e.g. BGS et al., 2001;Buschmann et al., 2008;Frisbie et al., 2009;Smedley et al., 2003). These tend to be in areas with superficial deposits dominated by clay-rich alluvial overbank and deltaic deposits and where confined conditions in the underlying sands facilitate the development of strongly reducing groundwater conditions in the presence of relatively-fresh NOM.</p>
        <p>Increased salinity in some high-U alluvial groundwaters under the arid conditions has been linked to evaporation. Examples include the San Joaquin Valley, California and Carson Desert, Nevada (Fujii and Swain, 1995;Welch and Lico, 1998). A correlation of U(VI) with salinity would suggest either conservative behaviour of uranyl as water undergoes evaporation or increased competition for sorption sites between uranyl and other solutes (Sahoo et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>Occurrences of high U concentrations in groundwater seem not to be a feature of limestone aquifers. While U(VI) is sequestered in calcite either in structural or adsorbed sites (Section 7.4.4), and is one mechanism for attenuating U (Nolan et al., 2021), contents are typically relatively small (Table 5). Marine carbonates precipitating from oxic marine water in equilibrium with aqueous U-CO 3 complexes and a U concentration typically around 3 μg/L would not be expected to accumulate large U contents in the solid carbonate. Accumulations of U observed in calcretes and speleothems are of local extent and unlikely to impact on a regional groundwater scale.</p>
        <p>Some of the best-documented groundwater U occurrences are in locations of known U mineralization. Examples include the Koongarra U deposit, Australia (Payne and thesis, 1991;Payne and Airey, 2006;Yanase et al., 1995), U deposits of the Yilgarn Craton, Australia (Noble et al., 2011), deposits of southern China (B. Zhang et al., 2020), Pinhal do Souto U mine, Portugal (Neiva et al., 2014), Smith Ranch-Highland, Wyoming, USA (Brown et al., 2016), Palmotto U deposit, Finland (Ahonen et al., 2004) and Königstein mine, Germany (Arnold et al., 2011). Case studies are also given in Section 8. Uranium concentrations in groundwater from these areas can reach extremes in the mg/L range in the vicinity of the mineralization. Mobility is enhanced under oxic, alkaline conditions in the presence of HCO 3 but high-U zones may be local depending on changing redox conditions across a given deposit. Low U concentrations have been observed in groundwater near U deposits where secondary minerals include phosphates (e.g. autunite, Table 4) as these retain U as solid uranyl phosphate (Jerden andSinha, 2003, 2006) even under oxidizing conditions.</p>
        <p>Uranium ores may also be present in association with acidgenerating ores such as pyrite. Examples include the Iberian Pyrite Belt of south-west Spain and Pocos de Caldas U mine, Brazil. Although U (IV) ore minerals are sparingly soluble over much of the natural range of pHs, mobilization can occur at pH &lt; 3, which can occur in acid mine drainage. In such conditions, U may be mobilized as the free uranyl ion, UO 2 2+ ; alternatively, SO 4 complexes can become important, for example UO 2 SO 4 (Arnold et al., 2011) or UO 2 (SO 4 ) 3 4- (Ladeira and Gonçalves, 2007). The mobility of U in sulphate-rich acidic conditions is also made use of in U in-situ leaching operations by the circulation of sulphuric acid. Although pyrite is ubiquitous in U mineralized areas, generation of acid drainage is dependent on the absence of substantial quantities of acid-neutralizing minerals. Acid drainage may be neutralized effectively in the presence of calcite, as occurs in the Dawson Range, Yukon, Canada (Skierszkan et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>The fate of U in the environment is both complex and much studied. Its distribution in freshwater, seawater, minerals, rocks and soils is welldocumented but its reactivity and sensitivity to environmental conditions mean that surprises can still occur. This is seen in the not infrequent discovery of U concentrations of more than 30 μg/L, the current provisional WHO guideline value, in some drinking water. Surface water can contain high U concentrations in places, but groundwater much more so. Key areas vulnerable to mobilization are: granitic and felsic volcanic rocks where U contents are relatively large (up to around 70 mg/kg compared to many other rock types with around 1-4 mg/kg U), continental sandstones, especially in alluvial plains, and U-mineralized and mined areas.</p>
        <p>Examples from granitic and felsic volcanic terrains are documented in peninsular India, eastern USA, Canada, South Korea, southern Finland, Norway, Switzerland and Burundi. Alluvial sediments with high-U groundwater are found in several parts of the USA, India, Pakistan, China and parts of Iraq and wind-blown loess deposits occur in the Chaco-Pampean Plain, Argentina. In these terrains, granitic and felsic volcanic precursors are often inferred as the original provenance of the mobilized U. Areas of U mineralization are also documented in parts of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Germany, Portugal and USA. Many high-U groundwater provinces occur in arid and semi-arid areas where evaporation of solutes may increase U concentrations further. The percentage exceedances of U above the WHO provisional guideline value sampled in groundwater from these areas vary significantly. For example, studies in granitic basement areas of peninsular India have shown up to 78% exceedance in Karnataka, while others showed 33% in Rajasthan and 5% in Gujurat. Around 29% were in excess in a survey from Burundi. In alluvial aquifers, exceedance statistics were around 8% in one study from the High Plains alluvial aquifer and 29% in a study from the Edwards-Trinity aquifer, USA; another showed 24% exceedance in groundwater from the Datong Basin of China. While the use of these groundwaters as sources of drinking water cannot be confirmed in all documented studies and the statistical representativeness of the survey designs cannot be verified, the figures indicate some substantial exceedances. However, even in high-U groundwater provinces, the occurrence of groundwater sources with low concentrations can still be significant. Further testing to identify safe drinking-water sources is therefore warranted. This is especially important in arid and semi-arid areas where water resources are likely to be already scarce.</p>
        <p>The documented distributions of U in groundwater highlight not only the high-U occurrences but also the regions where little testing has taken place. Examples include parts of large alluvial plains where oxic conditions are likely to prevail (e.g. the upper portions of the Indus of Pakistan) and numerous areas of the world with recognized U mineralization (e.g. Russia, Kazakhstan and southern Africa). Many private groundwater supplies have not been tested for U, including in many developed countries (e.g. USA, Europe). Uranium is also less commonly reported in areas where concentrations are low or expected to be low.</p>
        <p>A legacy of U-contaminated sites arises from both industrial and military uses that need to be contained and possibly decontaminated. Despite many detailed studies of such sites, there remains considerable uncertainty in how to prevent downstream contamination over the long term. Uranium solubility and transport are sensitive to its environment and responds to the key variables controlling the major-ion water quality: redox, pH, alkalinity and hardness, all factors that are difficult to manipulate on a large scale and over a long timescale.</p>
        <p>There is also a need to dispose of, or recycle, the waste from existing and future nuclear reactors in a safe way. This has spurred the need for simple (but reliable) performance assessment models of U containment and in closed-cycle schemes to recover the most valuable elements (U and Pu). In recent years, the relatively high and constant concentration of U in seawater (3.3 μg/L) and the renewed interest in nuclear power by nations without sizeable land-based U reserves has led to interest in the possible 'mining' of U from seawater. Any expansion of the nuclear power industry will require additional safe places to dispose of the resulting waste.</p>
        <p>These issues all require a deep understanding of U chemistry to be able to manage the resultant waste safely and to not contaminate the environment. This is reflected in the dominant role that redox reactions and complexation play. Under reducing conditions, the reduction of U (VI) to U(IV) occurs readily under conditions that are broadly similar to that of Fe reduction, and invariably results in a dramatic immobilization of U in some form of non-crystalline UO 2 solid, possibly microbiallymediated and still not that well-defined, especially in terms of its solubility.</p>
        <p>The behaviour of U(VI) in oxidizing environments is largely determined by the 'battle of the ligands', notably the competition between surface ligands especially of iron, aluminium and manganese oxides and humic substances, and in solution, dissolved carbonate. These reactions largely determine its solubility and whether or not it will move. Uranium is also bound strongly to humic substances but these have a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character in that they can both be soluble, and hence mobile, or insoluble and immobile, sometimes even switching between the two depending on the chemical environment.</p>
        <p>Relatively few laboratory experiments (e.g. sorption, solubility) are carried out in a CO 2 -free environment, and even fewer in a genuinely 'O 2 -free' environment (PO 2 (g) &lt; 10 -65 atm), even though this would often provide useful new information, albeit at the expense of added experimental complexity.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, to be of use in making predictions about the fate of U, the controlling reactions must be incorporated into models and databases and accessed with software. Other than for the simplest reactions, such as complexation in solution and the precipitation of pure minerals, there is little agreement on the best way to do this, at least in detail. This is seen in the numerous variations in surface complexation models with their different treatments of the electrostatic interactions. Consequently, the available modelling software often fails to reflect the latest understanding and so practitioners are often deprived of the most effective tools. The interactions between mineral-NOM-U are central to many applications but are complex and need state-of-the-art experimentation and modelling to unravel. Even with the precipitation of pure U-containing minerals, of which there are many, the kinetics and other factors controlling dissolution and precipitation are often poorly understood or documented, leaving the choice of a set of the most relevant minerals as a major challenge in modelling. The factors controlling the kinetics of 'slow' reactions involving surface and mineral rearrangements are important for long-term simulations but are rather poorly understood.</p>
        <p>In cases where drinking water contains excessive concentrations of U, complexes of U-CO 3 clearly play a major role in maintaining its mobility. These complexes are so stable that they are likely to dominate U speciation even in aqueous systems close to pH 7 and open to the atmosphere. This dominance probably reduces the chemical toxicity to microorganisms. The effect of complexation on the toxicity of U in drinking water for humans is less clear as major changes in chemical speciation occur in vivo (e.g. within the stomach at around pH 1.3-2.5). Nonetheless, the lack of evidence for clinical symptoms of chemical toxicity of U among communities drinking water (groundwater) at concentrations above international guidelines and limits is at once encouraging and indicative of a need for further research.</p>
