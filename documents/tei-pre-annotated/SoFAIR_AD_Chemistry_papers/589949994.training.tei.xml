        <p>The recent discovery of single-ion magnets with magnetic hysteresis above liquid-nitrogen temperatures placed these compounds among the best candidates to realize high-density storage devices. Starting from a prototypical dysprosocenium molecule, showing hysteresis up to 60 K, we derive here a general recipe to design high-blocking-temperature rare-earth single-ion magnets. The complex magnetic relaxation is unraveled by combining magnetization and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements with inelastic neutron scattering experiments and ab initio calculations, thus disentangling the different mechanisms and identifying the key ingredients behind slow relaxation.The recent discovery of single-ion magnets with magnetic hysteresis above liquid-nitrogen temperatures placed these compounds among the best candidates to realize high-density storage devices.

        <p>Since the discovery of magnetic hysteresis in Mn 12 [1,2], molecular nanomagnets (MNMs) were proposed to reach the ultimate miniaturization of information storage devices. Indeed, their magnetic bistability enables one to encode a bit of information in a single molecule [3,4]. These systems are also ideal test beds for new quantum technologies [5][6][7], could constitute promising units of future quantum computing architectures [8][9][10][11][12][13][14], and were exploited to unveil peculiar quantum phenomena [15][16][17].Since the discovery of magnetic hysteresis in Mn 12 [1,2], molecular nanomagnets (MNMs) were proposed to reach the ultimate miniaturization of information storage devices.

        <p>In order to achieve long relaxation times, synthetic efforts are nowadays focusing on transition-metal [18][19][20] or rare-earth [21] complexes with unquenched orbital angular momentum, which can be characterized by a large anisotropy barrier between the two orientations of the molecular magnetic moment [22]. This led to the synthesis of 4 f -based single-ion magnets (SIMs) showing slow magnetic relaxation [21,[23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31], culminated with the very recent discovery of axial dysprosocenium complexes [32][33][34] displaying magnetic hysteresis up to 80 K. However, in spite of these great experimental achievements, magnetic relaxation in this new class of compounds [35] is not really understood. A variety of phenomenological formulas have been proposed, but an overarching model able to capture the essential ingredients controlling the relaxation dynamics and to explain the observed behavior is still lacking. Such a model is of crucial importance to design new MNMs with even slower relaxation and to exploit these systems for quantum technologies [6,9,10,12,14].In order to achieve long relaxation times, synthetic efforts are nowadays focusing on transition-metal [18][19][20] or rare-earth [21] complexes with unquenched orbital angular momentum, which can be characterized by a large anisotropy barrier between the two orientations of the molecular magnetic moment [22].

        <p>Here we study the [Dy(C 5 H t 2 Bu 3 -1, 2, 4) 2 ][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] dysprosocenium complex (1) [32] as a prototype system to investigate magnetic relaxation in rare-earth SIMs. We disentangle the different relaxation mechanisms, and we derive a model explaining all of them. This is achieved by combining singlecrystal experiments [DC and AC magnetometry, high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)] with ab initio calculations of the crystal-field (CF) states and of the vibrational modes. In addition, inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is used to validate ab initio calculations of both the static CF and of the phonon density of states (DOS), showing very good agreement. We find that magnetic relaxation in 1 arises from the interplay of multistep Orbach, first-and second-order Raman, and quantum tunneling of the magnetization processes. Our model allows us to predict the temperature and field dependence of each mechanism, thus marking the crossover between them, as sketched in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we identify the essential ingredients leading to high blocking temperatures T B (here defined as the temperature where the magnetic relaxation time is equal to 100 s [34,36]) in rare-earth SIMs. In particular, suppressing the efficacy of the Raman mechanism is mandatory in order to set T B in the high-T region, consistent with recent empirical observations [36]. We show that the Raman process is driven by low-energy acoustic phonons and is particularly inefficient in 1 thanks to a phonon DOS relatively flat in the range of ∼5-20 meV, to a large gap (65 meV) between the two lowest crystal-field doublets, and to an ineffective magnetoelastic coupling with optical phonons. These observations provide a route to the synthesis of SIMs with even improved performances.Here we study the [Dy(C 5 H t 2 Bu 3 -1, 2, 4) 2 ][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] dysprosocenium complex (1) [32] as a prototype system to investigate magnetic relaxation in rare-earth SIMs. We disentangle the different relaxation mechanisms, and we derive a model explaining all of them.

        <p>Starting from the eigenstates of H J , we compute magnetic relaxation rates by considering both resonant and nonresonant processes, using the phonon DOS computed ab initio and validated by INS. As detailed below and sketched in Fig. 1, we find that resonant Orbach processes dominate at high temperature, where optical phonons resonant with CF gaps are available. For T 60 K first-and second-order Raman rates emerge in different field ranges, while quantum tunneling dominates in the low-T , low-B region.

        <p>Out-of-equilibrium magnetization measurements have been performed by preparing the sample in zero field and then measuring the magnetization M as a function of time after switching on B in the range 0.005 &lt; B &lt; 2 T. Most of the measurements have been performed at a fixed angle θ ≈ 60 • between the field and the molecular easy axis to investigate relaxation in the presence of sizable B x and B z . We have finally tested our results with some measurements at θ ≈ 0 • . The observed time dependence of M has been fitted by a stretched exponential function, which points to a small strain in the CF parameters, yielding an asymmetric distribution of relaxation times (see Appendix B and Ref. [52]). The extracted relaxation rates are shown in Fig. 3(a) as a function of the applied field. These and all the experimental findings reported in the following and in the SM are very well reproduced by using ζ a1 = 1.8 × 10 -9 s 1/2 , ζ a2 = 1.1 × 10 -16 s, and ζ o = 0.9 Å s -1/2 in Eq. ( 2) (see solid lines in Fig. 3). The decrease of τ -1 at ∼0.1 T is due to intermolecular dipole fields modeled by the Brons-Van Vleck term (σ B = 30 mT, μ = 3) [48], while the increase above 0.3 T is due to the Raman-II mechanism, with τ -1 ∝ B 2 . Measurements at θ ≈ 0 • are reported in green and evidence a modest slowdown of the dynamics, consistent with a decrease of the transverse component of B [54]. The increase of τ -1 above ∼0.3 T in Fig. 3(a) suggests that Raman-II becomes the leading mechanism at high fields, a regime which can be investigated by NMR measurements. Therefore, we have measured the proton spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T 1 as a function of temperature. Part of the data is reported in Fig. 3(b) for two different values of B at θ ≈ 60 • . It can be shown [55] (Appendix D) that in the present regime (characterized by an electronic relaxation rate much smaller than the proton Larmor frequency 3(b) shows that data collected for different B are practically superimposed. Thus, in the temperature and field region probed by NMR τ -1 ∝ B 2 , demonstrating that Raman-II is the leading relaxation mechanism (see Fig. 1) [56], consistent with our prediction. This conclusion is further supported by the power-law temperature dependence of 1/T 1 below 60 K, in excellent agreement with our model, yielding m = 2.1 [solid lines in Fig. 3(b)]. Another data set collected at θ ≈ 90 • and B = 2.5-5 T is reported in the SM [38], showing analogous agreement with our model.Out-of-equilibrium magnetization measurements have been performed by preparing the sample in zero field and then measuring the magnetization M as a function of time after switching on B in the range 0.005 &lt; B &lt; 2 T.

        <p>At lower fields, our model and data in Fig. 3(a) indicate that the Raman-II contribution is overcome by the Raman-I (field-independent) mechanism. This is confirmed by the temperature dependence of τ -1 extracted from magnetization measurements at B = 0.1 T [Fig. 3(c)], showing a power-law behavior for T 50 K, very well reproduced by our simulation (with n = 2.3). These results are also in good agreement with powder data on the same compound [32]. The set of relaxation coefficients calculated from the model [Eq. ( 2)] is listed in the table in Fig. 3(g). The measured temperature and field dependence of τ -1 (see Fig. 3 andAppendix C) exclude a significant direct contribution (arising, e.g., from a modulation of the Zeeman or hyperfine interaction [57]), which would require the presence of phonons of energy corresponding to the splitting of the ground doublet = g z μ B B z , yielding τ -1 ∝ B 5 coth( /2k B T ) ≈ B 4 T [37]. This is particularly evident by examining data collected in the high-field region: the field dependence extracted from magnetization data, as well as the temperature dependence obtained from NMR at different values of B, cannot be reproduced by assuming a direct instead of a Raman-II contribution (see Figs. 6 and7).At lower fields, our model and data in Fig. 3(a) indicate that the Raman-II contribution is overcome by the Raman-I (field-independent) mechanism.

        <p>At higher temperatures, simulating the relaxation dynamics requires consideration of the rate matrix W involving all 16 levels of the J = 15/2 multiplet (see Appendix D), including real transitions to excited CF states. By diagonalizing W we find that a single relaxation rate dominates the dynamics, yielding an Arrhenius-like behavior: τ -1 HT = τ -1 0 e -U/k B T , in excellent agreement with AC-susceptibility measurements reported in Fig. 3(d). This process is driven by optical phonons and enables us to determine ζ o in Eq. ( 2). The calculated τ -1 HT is then characterized by τ 0 = 1.8 × 10 -11 s and U = 1786 K [Figs. 3(d) and 3(g)], in excellent agreement with powder data [32].At higher temperatures, simulating the relaxation dynamics requires consideration of the rate matrix W involving all 16 levels of the J = 15/2 multiplet (see Appendix D), including real transitions to excited CF states.

        <p>We now discuss the key ingredients explaining the behavior of 1 in order to identify strategies to realize highblocking-temperature molecular storage devices. The crucial requirement is to reduce the efficiency of Raman relaxation, thus increasing T B up to the Orbach region. The integral (3) involves both the acoustic (0 &lt; ω &lt; ω D ) and optical (ω &gt; ω D ) parts of the phonon spectrum, with hω D = 4.4 meV, determined from the phonon DOS [38]. First, we note that due to the form of integrand (3) (strongly decreasing with energy [63]) Raman relaxation is driven by acoustic phonons. This is evident by comparing the calculations reported with green and red symbols in Fig. 4; the former are obtained by considering only the contribution of acoustic phonons, and the latter by including the whole phonon spectrum. For T 70 K, the two curves are practically superimposed and show a power-law behavior (black solid line) with n = 2.3 and m = 2.1, while the contribution of optical phonons [light blue symbols in Fig. 4(a)] is negligible. At a higher temperature [T res in Fig. 4(a)], a resonant two-step process emerges in the Raman-I mechanism. This results from optical phonons at energies close to the lowest crystal-field gap CF ≈ 60 meV, leading to a divergence in the denominator of M I from secondorder perturbation theory [38] and hence an Orbach-like temperature dependence τ -1 ∼ e -CF /k B T . Here T res ≈ 70 K [red symbols in Fig. 4(a)]; that is, the transition to this regime would occur in a region where Raman-I is already overcome by the multistep Orbach process (dashed line and Fig. 1).We now discuss the key ingredients explaining the behavior of 1 in order to identify strategies to realize highblocking-temperature molecular storage devices.

        <p>Suppression of Raman relaxation (as observed in 1) can be obtained by combining several ingredients [all reducing integral (3)]: (i) a large crystal-field splitting between the two lowest Kramers doublets, which can be engineered by a judicious choice of molecular geometry, and (ii) a relatively small coupling with low-energy optical modes, meaning that vibrations mostly influencing the local CF at Dy should be high in energy (above ∼30 meV in 1; see Fig. S1 [38]). This occurs in the presence of a rigid first-coordination sphere. Features (i) and (ii) increase T res , thus making optical phonons ineffective for Raman-I. For instance, T res is reduced both by reducing CF [compare the dark blue curve in Fig. 4(a), obtained by halving the CF parameters, with the original (red) one] and by increasing ζ o . The last ingredient to suppress Raman relaxation is (iii) a rather small hω D followed by a plateau in the DOS (i.e., an optical phonon DOS not strongly increasing with energy at low energies), which arises here due to high-energy intramolecular modes and weak intermolecular interactions. Indeed, for T &gt; 20 K both Raman-I and Raman-II contributions show a weak power-law temperature dependence, with n = 2.3 ≈ m = 2.1, close to the T 2 behavior corresponding to the high-temperature limit of Raman mechanisms [43,50]. An increase in ω D shifts the crossover between low-and high-T limits to higher temperatures, as shown by the magenta curves in Fig. 4, increasing n (m) to 3.4 (2.6). A similar effect is obtained with an optical ρ(E ) strongly increasing with energy at low energy or with highly dispersive low-energy optical modes.Suppression of Raman relaxation (as observed in 1) can be obtained by combining several ingredients [all reducing integral (3)]: (i) a large crystal-field splitting between the two lowest Kramers doublets, which can be engineered by a judicious choice of molecular geometry, and (ii) a relatively small coupling with low-energy optical modes, meaning that vibrations mostly influencing the local CF at Dy should be high in energy (above ∼30 meV in 1; see Fig. S1 [38]).

        <p>Once Raman relaxation is suppressed, further improvements rely on increasing τ 0 and U in the Orbach process, driven by optical phonons. This can be achieved by engineering molecular vibrational modes [to increase τ 0 by reducing the magnetoelastic coupling or ρ(E ) at the energies corresponding to CF gaps] or by chemically designing molecules with larger CF splittings and more axial Kramers doublets (thus increasing U ). CF engineering to increase U is much more efficient than tailoring phonon modes, as demonstrated by the recent record hysteresis temperature of 80 K [33].Once Raman relaxation is suppressed, further improvements rely on increasing τ 0 and U in the Orbach process, driven by optical phonons.

        <p>In conclusion, we have developed a model for magnetic relaxation in high-blocking-temperature SIMs based on targeted single-crystal magnetization and NMR measurements, neutron spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations. We have disentangled the various mechanisms behind the complex relaxation phenomenon in rare-earth SIMs and highlighted the peculiar temperature and field dependence of each mechanism, catching the essential ingredients leading to slow magnetic relaxation in these compounds. We have used this information to provide rules for reducing the effectiveness of the Raman mechanism and thus increasing the blocking temperature. The general recipe is a crystal of weakly interacting rigid molecules in order to have soft acoustic branches and high-energy optical modes. but rather to highlight the essential ingredients behind slow magnetic relaxation, which already emerge in our minimal treatment based on Refs. [39][40][41]43,[64][65][66]. We adopt the harmonic approximation for lattice vibrations, i.e., H p = kλ hω kλ (a † kλ a kλ + 1 2 ), where a † kλ (a kλ ) creates (destroys) a phonon of wave vector k in the λth phonon branch with energy hω kλ [42]. For simplicity, we assume that the magnetoelastic interaction involving acoustic (dispersive) phonons is driven by the "rotational contribution," which changes the direction of anisotropy axes while keeping the molecule rigid [39,41]. We also assume an isotropic phonon space (k x = k y = k z ) [43] with Debye dispersion ω kλ = v|k| and sound velocity v ≡ v x = v y = v z .
