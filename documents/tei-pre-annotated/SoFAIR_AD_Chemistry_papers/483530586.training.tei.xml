        <p>Precious metal complexes with the d 6 valence electron configuration often exhibit luminescent metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states, which form the basis for many applications in lighting, sensing, solar cells, and synthetic photochemistry. Iron(II) has received much attention as a possible Earth-abundant alternative, but to date no iron(II) complex has been reported to show MLCT emission upon continuous-wave excitation. Manganese(I) has the same electron configuration as iron(II), but had typically been overlooked in the search for cheap MLCT luminophores until now. Here we report that isocyanide chelate ligands give access to air-stable manganese(I) complexes that exhibit MLCT luminescence in solution at room temperature. These compounds were successfully used as photosensitizers for energy-and electron-transfer reactions and were shown to promote the photoisomerization of trans-stilbene. The observable electron transfer photoreactivity occurred from the emissive MLCT state, whilst the triplet energy transfer photoreactivity originates from a ligand-centered 3 π-π* state.Precious metal complexes with the d 6 valence electron configuration often exhibit luminescent metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states, which form the basis for many applications in lighting, sensing, solar cells, and synthetic photochemistry.

        <p>The long-lived MLCT excited states of many Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes play key roles in light-emitting devices 1 , dye-sensitized solar cells 2 , photoredox catalysis 3 , artificial photosynthesis 4 and photodynamic therapy 5 . There is a long-standing interest in replacing these precious and rare 4d 6 and 5d 6 ions by cheaper 3d 6 elements, and until now essentially all efforts in that direction concentrated on Fe(II) 6 . However, the MLCT states of Fe(II) complexes deactivate on very rapid timescales, due to metal-centered (MC) excited states situated at much lower energies than in Ru(II) or Ir(III) [7][8][9][10][11] . Recently, these undesired deactivation processes were decelerated by innovative molecular design 12,13 , yet no MLCT luminescence after continuous-wave excitation has been reported to date 14,15 . In the course of these efforts, ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) luminescence from Fe(III) (3d 5 ) complexes was discovered 16,17 , but the direction of charge transfer is important for many applications hence emissive MLCT states of 3d 6 complexes remain a strategic key target 18 .

        <p>We recently reported a very weakly luminescent Cr(0) complex, but that compound suffered from sensitivity to air due to facile oxidation of Cr(0) 20 . For the present study, we turned to isoelectronic Mn(I), for which some air-stable complexes with π-acceptor ligands had been known [21][22][23] . After iron and titanium, manganese is the third most abundant transition metal element, exceeding the natural abundance of copper by a factor of 18, which seems noteworthy because copper has received much attention from the photophysics and photochemistry community [24][25][26][27] .We recently reported a very weakly luminescent Cr(0) complex, but that compound suffered from sensitivity to air due to facile oxidation of Cr(0) 20 .

        <p>Isocyanide ligands can stabilize metals in low oxidation states 37 , and monodentate arylisocyanides provided access to emissive W(0) complexes in earlier studies 38,39 . Since chelate ligands usually give more robust coordination compounds, we previously developed bidentate isocyanide ligands with terphenyl backbones to obtain photoactive Cr(0) and Mo(0) complexes 20,40 . For the Mn(I) complexes reported herein (Fig. 1), we synthesized two isocyanide chelates (Supplementary Information) with thiophene units in the backbone to optimize bite angles, one of them bidentate (L bi ) and the other tridentate (L tri ). The free ligands reacted with Mn(CO)5Br to the homoleptic complexes [Mn(L bi )3] + and [Mn(L tri )2] + (Fig. 1), which were characterized with all standard techniques (Supplementary Information) including 55 Mn NMR spectroscopy. The 55 Mn NMR shifts of [Mn(L bi )3] + and [Mn(L tri )2] + were determined as δ = -1225 and -1419 ppm, respectively, and fall both unambiguously in the range -1000 &gt; δ &gt; -1500 for Mn(I) complexes 41 . L tri binds in meridional fashion, and the direct comparison of bis(tridentate) and tris(bidentate) coordination environments allowed us to probe differences in robustness and photophysical behavior. Photoluminescence and electronic structure Both complexes are yellow due to an absorption band near 400 nm (solid purple lines in Fig. 2 / Supplementary Fig. 24), which tails to the deep blue region and is not present in the free ligands (dotted purple lines). Excitation into this absorption band causes solvatochromic luminescence, which red-shifts by roughly 1500 cm -1 between toluene and CH3CN. In some solvents Raman-scattered excitation light is detectable (asterisks in Fig. 2 / Supplementary Fig. 24), but the emission bands are unstructured. The luminescence quantum yields (φ) in deaerated CH3CN at 20 °C are 0.05% for [Mn(L bi )3] + and 0.03% for [Mn(L tri )2] + (Supplementary Information), which is more than one order of magnitude higher than for our recently reported Cr(0) complex emitting from a 3 MLCT state 20 , whereas Fe(II) complexes are completely non-emissive under comparable conditions. The presence of low-lying metal-centered (MC) excited states in the 3d 6 configuration makes it much harder to establish luminescent charge-transfer excited states than in the 3d 0 and 3d 10 configurations, in which MC states are absent. Thus, the step from no luminescence (as in all absorption spectra (Fig. 3a) are essentially a linear combination of the difference spectra of metal oxidation (Fig. 3c) and ligand reduction (Fig. 3b), as expected for MLCT transitions 42 . This very good agreement between transient absorption and spectro-electrochemical data (for metal-based oxidation and ligand-centered reduction) is compatible with an electronically excited state that has strong MLCT character. Luminescence lifetimes are tri-exponential with weighted average lifetimes of 0.74 ns for [Mn(L bi )3] + and 1.73 ns for [Mn(L tri )2] + in deaerated CH3CN at 20 °C (Table 1), close to some of the longest lifetimes for (dark) MLCT states in Fe(II) complexes 12,13 , and similar to the MLCT lifetime (2.2 ns) of our recently reported Cr(0) isocyanide complex 20 .Isocyanide ligands can stabilize metals in low oxidation states 37 , and monodentate arylisocyanides provided access to emissive W(0) complexes in earlier studies 38,39 .

        <p>The backbones of our ligands L tri and L bi contain sequences of CNAr-thiophene-ArNC units, and flipping of the central thiophene unit with respect to the neighboring ArNC (arylisocyanide) units can lead to different conformers (Supplementary Information), and this causes the multi-exponential decay behavior 40 . All three decay components (τ1, τ2, τ3) have identical luminescence spectra (Supplementary Figs. 32/33), which is in line with a single emissive state in different conformers. In isoelectronic [Fe(bpy)3] 2+ , excitation into the 1 MLCT absorption band is followed by intersystem crossing to the lowest 3 MLCT excited state within less than 20 fs 43 , and from this perspective it seems plausible that the emissive MLCT states of our Mn(I) complexes (at 2.9 eV) are triplets. However, upon addition of excess naphthalene (with a triplet energy (ET) of 2.64 eV) or p-terphenyl (ET = 2.52 eV) the characteristic triplet excited-state absorption signatures of these polyaromatic hydrocarbons are not observable, even though rate constants for triplet-triplet energy transfer typically reach the diffusion-limit when the driving-force is 0.2 eV or greater 44 . Only when polyaromatic hydrocarbons with lower triplet energies such as pyrene (ET = 2.10 eV, Supplementary Information) or anthracene (ET = 1.85 eV, see further below) are used, there is clear evidence for triplet-triplet energy transfer. Thus, it looks as if our Mn(I) complexes have a (dark) triplet excited state below 2.52 eV (p-terphenyl) but above 2.10 eV (pyrene). However, upon direct excitation of the Mn(I) complexes in solution at 20°C, we were unable to detect long-lived excited states other than the MLCT in Fig. 3a / Supplementary Fig. 25.The backbones of our ligands L tri and L bi contain sequences of CNAr-thiophene-ArNC units, and flipping of the central thiophene unit with respect to the neighboring ArNC (arylisocyanide) units can lead to different conformers (Supplementary Information), and this causes the multi-exponential decay behavior 40 .

        <p>To get direct insight into the electronic structures of our coordinated ligands (and possible low-lying ligand-centered triplet states), we explored the [ZnCl2(L bi )] complex (Supplementary Fig. 44). Expectedly, the UV-Vis spectrum of [ZnCl2(L bi )] closely resembles that of uncoordinated L bi , as the MLCT absorption bands observable for the Mn(I) complexes at 400 nm (Fig. 2 / Supplementary Fig. 24) are absent for Zn(II). In solution at 20 °C, [ZnCl2(L bi )] exhibits luminescence with a band maximum at 440 nm (Supplementary Fig. 44), blue-shifted more than 50 nm relative to the MLCT emissions in Figs. 2 / Supplementary Fig. 24. This luminescence with a lifetime of 1.24 ns (Supplementary Fig. 45) is attributed to fluorescence from a 1 π-π* state at 3.2 eV (Fig. 4e). In our search for a low-lying 3 in presence of excess Zn(II) complex yields a long-lived (τT &gt; 50 µs) photoproduct that can be assigned to tripletexcited [ZnCl2(L bi )] (Supplementary Fig. 47), whilst the Ru(II) complex with ET = 2.2 eV fails to provide this photoproduct. From this we conclude that coordinated L bi has 3 π-π* state at ca. 2.3 eV (Fig. 4e), and given the structural similarity between L bi and L tri , it seems reasonable to assume that this is also the case for the tridentate ligand (for which we have been unable to isolate a stable Zn(II) complex). It follows that there must be a ligandcentered 3 π-π* state at ca. 2.3 eV in [Mn(L bi )3] + and [Mn(L tri )2] + (Fig. 4d). When exciting the Mn(I) complexes in frozen 2-methyl-THF at 77 K, one observes dual emission (red trace in Fig. 4a / Supplementary Fig. 26), with two bands with maxima at 475 and 605 nm. The higher energy band resembles the room temperature emission (green trace), but the additional low-energy band is more prominent at 77 K. In time-gated experiments at 77 K (Figs. 4b / Supplementary Fig. 26), the intensity ratio between the two bands depends strongly on the time delay used for detection, because they have very disparate decay behavior.

        <p>This opens greater perspectives for photoredox catalysis and applications in artificial photosynthesis, for example photochemical water reduction or CO2 fixation. Further developments of Mn(I) coordination chemistry and photophysics seem desirable for this, but the foundations are now laid. The high abundance, low cost and comparatively low toxicity of many of its compounds make manganese a very attractive element.This opens greater perspectives for photoredox catalysis and applications in artificial photosynthesis, for example photochemical water reduction or CO2 fixation.

        <p>The finding that MLCT and ligand-centered 3 π-π* states of our Mn(I) complexes can both be photoactive, including dual emission at 77 K, is unexpected and contrasts typical behavior of precious metal based compounds, where only the MLCT state is usually emissive and photochemically relevant 51 . This fundamental insight complements recent unexpected discoveries concerning the photophysical behavior of first-row transition metal complexes, for example luminescent LMCT states in Fe(III) complexes 16,17 or dual emission from V(III) complexes 52 . It seems that the photophysics and the photochemistry of coordination chemistry is at the verge of a new era, with important implications for diverse fields and applications, ranging from light-emitting devices and dye-sensitized solar cells to synthetic photochemistry, solar fuels production, and phototherapy.The finding that MLCT and ligand-centered 3 π-π* states of our Mn(I) complexes can both be photoactive, including dual emission at 77 K, is unexpected and contrasts typical behavior of precious metal based compounds, where only the MLCT state is usually emissive and photochemically relevant 51 .

        <p>previously studied Fe(II) complexes) to weak MLCT emission in our Mn(I) complexes represents an important breakthrough. In picosecond transient absorption spectroscopy a ground-state bleach is observable near 400 nm (Fig. 3a / Supplementary Fig. 25) and an excited-state absorption band appears at 470 nm. Following pulsed excitation, the excited-state absorption at 470 nm and the luminescence at 460 nm show very similar decay behavior (Fig. 3d / Supplementary Fig. 25), indicating that both signals belong to the same excited state. MLCT states are formally comprised of an oxidized metal and a reduced ligand, whose individual spectral signatures are accessible via spectroelectrochemistry 42 . In our complexes, Mn(I) is oxidized reversibly to Mn(II) at ca. 1.0 V vs SCE (Fig. 3f / Supplementary Fig. 25), in line with expectation (Supplementary Information) [21][22][23] . Reductive sweeps (Fig. 3e / Supplementary Fig. 25) contain several irreversible waves, the first one of which (at -1.9 V vs SCE) is attributable to the reduction of coordinated L tri /L bi to (L tri ) •-/(L bi ) •-. At a constant potential of -2.2 V vs SCE, the spectroelectrochemical (L tri ) •--L tri (Fig. 3b) and (L bi ) •--L bi (Supplementary Fig. 25) difference spectra are obtained. At a fixed potential of 1.2 V vs SCE, one obtains the spectro-electrochemical difference spectra in Fig. 3c / Supplementary Fig. 25, which correspond to the subtraction of spectra of Mn(I) from Mn(II) species. The picosecond transient Supplementary Fig. 27) 48 . These findings, together with our control experiments, provide unambiguous evidence for triplet-triplet energy transfer. Based on relative actinometry experiments with [Ru(bpy)3] 2+ (Supplementary Information), the quantum efficiency of triplet energy transfer under these conditions is 9.4% for [Mn(L bi )3] + and 12.1% for [Mn(L tri )2] + . The MLCT emission of the Mn(I) complexes remains virtually unquenched, indicating that the energy transfer to anthracene does not directly involve the MLCT state, but instead occurs from the 3 π-π* state at 2.3 eV (pink box in Fig. 4d).previously studied Fe(II) complexes) to weak MLCT emission in our Mn(I) complexes represents an important breakthrough.

        <p>In preparation of lab-scale photocatalysis experiments with our complexes, we performed photostability studies under long-term LED irradiation at 405 nm (Supplementary Information). In CH2Cl2, [Mn(L bi )3] + is considerably more photo-robust than [Mn(L tri )2] + , and it seems possible that this is related to differences in metal-ligand bonding strengths between the two complexes. In particular, π-backbonding is significantly stronger in [Mn(L bi )3] + than in [Mn(L tri )2] + according to infrared spectroscopy, which shows C≡N stretches of 2120 cm -1 for both free ligands, compared to 2064 cm -1 for [Mn(L bi )3] + and 2081 cm -1 for [Mn(L tri )2] + (Supplementary Information). Under 440-nm irradiation of 2 mM [Mn(L bi )3] + in a deaerated CD2Cl2 solution containing 50 mM trans-stilbene (with a triplet energy of 2.14 eV), the photoisomerization to cis-stilbene (Fig. 4f) was completed to 80% in 5 hours (Supplementary Information), whilst a reference solution containing no Mn(I) complex did not show significant conversion. This represents successful proof-of-concept for lab-scale photocatalysis and paves the way for further applications in synthetic photochemistry 49 .In preparation of lab-scale photocatalysis experiments with our complexes, we performed photostability studies under long-term LED irradiation at 405 nm (Supplementary Information).

        <p>The family of Mn(I) isocyanide complexes introduced herein have their lowest MLCT states at significantly higher energies (ca. 0.8 eV) than a recently explored (isoelectronic) Cr(0) isocyanide complex 20 , mostly due to the higher metal oxidation state. The development of chelating isocyanide ligands has led to the long-sought MLCT emission from 3d 6 metal complexes, which has been far more difficult to obtain than in Cu(I) compounds, where the lack of metal-centered excited states eliminates an important nonradiative decay channel.The family of Mn(I) isocyanide complexes introduced herein have their lowest MLCT states at significantly higher energies (ca. 0.8 eV) than a recently explored (isoelectronic) Cr(0) isocyanide complex 20 , mostly due to the higher metal oxidation state.
