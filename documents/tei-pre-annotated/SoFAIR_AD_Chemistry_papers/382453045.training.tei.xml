        <p>The development of fluorescent sensors has received increasing attention in recent years due to their simplicity and low detection limits. 1 F or the determination of copper ions, various techniques such as atomic absorption spectrometry, 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICPMS) 3 , inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), 4 and voltammetry 5 and anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) 6 have been applied. However, t hese methods cause operational difficulties, requiring well-trained personnel and high-cost analytical instrumentation. These techniques also lead to the destruction of the cells of biological samples and cannot be worked to visualize biological phenomena in situ . 7 For this reason, fluorescent sensors have emerged as a useful technique for high sensitivity, simplicity and for the non-destructive imaging of intracellular distribution for the detection of cations, anions and neutral species that are of great importance in the biological and environmental sectors. [8][9][10] Fluorescent chemosensors are molecules of abiotic origin, which show changes of one or more properties such as colour (colorimetric chemosensors), fluorescence (fluorescent chemosensors) or redox potentials (electrochemical sensors) upon interaction with guest species. [11][12][13] These sensors are mainly organic molecules, and may be categorized into four classes: (i) as fluorescent ligands which have identical receptor (the recognition site) and fluorophore (the signal source) (ii) as fluoroionophores where the fluorophore and receptor are involved in direct electronic conjugation, (iii) fluoroionophores combined via fluorophore-spacer-receptor systems, (iv) exciplex or excimer forming probes (EPs) where, the fluorophore and receptor units can construct an intramolecular exciplex or excimer. Herein, strong intramolecular geometry changes are observed after binding with the analyte by increasing or decreasing the ratio of excimer-to-monomer emission. 14,15 To be an ideal fluorescent chemosensor, the receptor must have the strongest affinity with the relevant target (binding-selectivity) and the fluorescence signal should avoid any environmental interference (signal-selectivity). 16 Among the heavy and transition metal ions, copper is one of the important trace elements for both plants and animals, including humans . 17 When levels of Cu 2+ exceeds cellular needs, it can be considered as toxic to biological systems. 18 The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set the limit of 1.3 ppm (~20 μM) for copper in drinking water. 14 For this reason, improved fluorescent chemosensors for the selective and sensitive detection of Cu 2+ are of great importance. [19][20][21][22] It is noteworthy that Cu 2+ ion detection creates some challenges when designing fluorescence turn-on (fluorescence intensity increases) sensors due to its paramagnetic nature with an unfilled d shell orbital. Moreover, according to the Irving-Williams rule, Cu 2+ has the strongest binding ability versus any other divalent metal ion of the first transition series. The paramagnetic cations Cu 2+ , Ni 2+ and Co 2+ are usually more strongly bound than the diamagnetic ions Zn 2+ or Cd 2+ , which is determined on the basis of the ionic radius and the second ionization potential. 14,23 Therefore, strong fluorescence "turn-off" (fluorescence intensity decreases) sensors were predominantly observed due to fluorescence quenching, upon addition of Cu 2+ . 24,25 Recently, many turn-on sensors have been studied for Cu 2+ detection by using the concept of ion-induced changes in the geometry or the flexibility of the ligand as well as from the availability of certain functional groups involved in fluorescence quenching for the ligand in the unbound state. 14 In this review, we discuss the sensing mechanisms of Cu 2+ with pyrene based fluorescent sensors. This will help shape the design of new pyrene chemosensors for copper ion determination based on different mechanisms such as excimer/exciplex formation, photoinduced electron transfer (PET), photoinduced charge transfer (PCT) , aggregation induced emission (AIE), ligand to metal charge transfer process (LMCT), chelation enhanced quenching mechanism (CHEQ) and Cu 2+ -selective reactions.The development of fluorescent sensors has received increasing attention in recent years due to their simplicity and low detection limits. 1 F or the determination of copper ions, various techniques such as atomic absorption spectrometry, 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICPMS) 3 , inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), 4 and voltammetry 5 and anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) 6 have been applied.

        <p>Copper is an important trace element for human metabolism and plays a vital role in the physiological processes of organisms. It contributes to the making of red blood cells and in maintaining nerve cells and the immune system. It also helps to create energy in the body and plays a significant role in order? collagen formation and the absorption of iron. Copper intake also reduces the probability for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis . Therefore, for normal development and for the proper working of the brain and as a cofactor of many enzymes, the presence of copper is essential. Moreover, copper has a vital contribution in energy efficiency and possesses the maximum electrical conductivity, except for silver. For this reason, it is used in power generation, transmission and electrical equipment. It also is in greatest demand in architecture (copper alloy materials), automotives, tubing, pipes, industrial and machined products, coins for currency, folk medicine and antimicrobial applications. 27Copper is an important trace element for human metabolism and plays a vital role in the physiological processes of organisms.

        <p>Copper present at lower or higher levels can increase the risk to health. Free Cu 2+ ion is both acutely and chronically toxic for aquatic life and microorganisms, even at micromolar concentrations. Copper deficiency is associated with growth failure and can affect deterioration of the nervous system. However, an excessive accumulation of copper may lead to neurodegenerative disorders, abnormalities in red blood cells and heart problems. Gene mutations are responsible for the two major genetic disorders of copper metabolism in humans such as Menkes' disease and Wilson's disease, and it is found that these diseases are the result of excessive intracellular copper transport. Increased serum copper levels have been linked with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease . Different diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC) and prion disease are also associated with the toxicity caused by Cu 2+ . B esides, copper is one of the most common metal pollutants because of its huge applications in our daily lives. For adults (19 years and above), the upper limit is 10 mg a day and if anyone consumes above this level, it is considered toxic. Moreover, Cu 2+ ions are often essential components in biochemical reactions such as catalysis, transport or biosynthesis at trace levels (&lt;1 µM). However, in the presence of large amounts of Cu 2+ , unhealthy interactions occur in biochemical redox processes and can, for instance result in the inhibition of enzyme activity or nephrotoxicity. 27,28 Therefore, it is necessary to design a technique that is effective for a rapid response toward Cu 2+ even at micromolar concentrations. The design and synthesis of fluorescent chemosensors for copper ion determination could help resolve these issues.Copper present at lower or higher levels can increase the risk to health.

        <p>Pyrene and pyrene derivatives have interesting photophysical properties notably a long lifetime, high quantum yield (τ M = 450 ns and Φ M = 0.60 in cyclohexane) and expanded π electron delocalization of the pyrene monomers. Pyrene derivatives generally display five well-shaped and fine absorption bands between 210 and 330 nm and the emission spectrum usually consist of a broad band centered at 400 nm. Fluorescence quenching of a pyrene fluorophore can easily occur in the presence of a variety of quenchers (heavy metals, anionic species and NPs), which may be due to through-bond and through-space energy transfer between pyrene and the quenchers. 29 A pyrene based fluorescent "off-on" chemosensor has been developed for detection of cyanide via ligand to Cu 2+ complex as Cu 2+ generally performs as a fluorescence quencher via a PET mechanism. 30 Pyrene also can perform as either an electron donor or acceptor during the energy transfer depending on the substituents attached to it, and as a result blue or red shifted emission bands are easily observed from the pyrene monomer emission band. One of the most interesting features of pyrene derivatives is that a pyrene monomer (λ abs = 350 nm, λ em = 398 nm) can combine with another pyrene monomer to form an excimer (or excited state dimer, λ em = 485 nm) because of its affinity for strong ππ interactions. 31 The changes in the emission properties of the pyrene excimer from a monomer has been used for designing sensors. [32][33][34] A pyrene-based triazole ligand was reported which exhibited self-assembl y in the presence of ZnCl 2 . The free ligand showed monomer emission bands at 382 and 402 nm with a broad shoulder at 420 nm. After addition of ZnCl 2 , it can bind with ZnCl 2 in a 2:1 ratio due to strong excimer emission at 410 nm. 35Pyrene and pyrene derivatives have interesting photophysical properties notably a long lifetime, high quantum yield (τ M = 450 ns and Φ M = 0.60 in cyclohexane) and expanded π electron delocalization of the pyrene monomers.

        <p>Fluorescent chemosensors for Cu 2+ detection have been designed based on different binding mechanisms which fulfill the criteria of affinity, selectivity and sensitivity. In general, the chemosensor is designed such that it contains oxygen or nitrogen donor atoms for co-ordination of the Cu 2+ . 36 In most of the cases, fluorescent sensors bind Cu 2+ by the fluorescence quenching process due to its paramagnetic nature which opens up the excited state de-excitation pathways by enhancing the rate of non-radioactive processes such as electronic energy transfer (EET) and/or photoinduced electron transfer (PET) involving the metal centers. Also, the free electron in the orbital is likely to quench the fluorescence via spin-orbit coupling. 37 There is also an enhancement of the fluorescence intensity in turn-on sensors, which are more desirable than turn-off sensors, with a red or blue shift of the emission after Cu 2+ ion b inding with ligand. Recently, some strategies have been developed for fluorescence off-on sensors for Cu 2+ detection. The classical sensing mechanisms such as photoinduced electron transfer (PET), 38,39 photoinduced charge transfer (PCT), 40,41 excimer/exciplex formation 42 are mainly mentioned when investigating binding phenomenon. There are also some mechanisms which control the response of a fluorophore to substrate binding including aggregation induced emission (AIE), ligand to metal charge transfer process (LMCT), chelation enhanced quenching mechanism (CHEQ) and Cu 2+ -assisted reactions.Fluorescent chemosensors for Cu 2+ detection have been designed based on different binding mechanisms which fulfill the criteria of affinity, selectivity and sensitivity.

        <p>When an excited fluorophore during its lifetime in an excited state interacts with a ground state fluorophore, an excimer is formed. 43 Excimer emission typically shows a red shifted broad fluorescence band in most aromatic molecules, 44 by about 6000 cm -1 to lower energies than the uncomplexed ("monomer") fluorophore emission.When an excited fluorophore during its lifetime in an excited state interacts with a ground state fluorophore, an excimer is formed. 43 Excimer emission typically shows a red shifted broad fluorescence band in most aromatic molecules, 44 by about 6000 cm -1 to lower energies than the uncomplexed ("monomer") fluorophore emission.</p>
        <p>There are two kinds of excimers based on the origin of the pyrene dimer: a dynamic excimer and a static excimer. The dynamic or static excimer formation depends on the distance between the two pyrene units (Fig. 2). 45 The conventional dynamic excimers are produced due to the interaction of the diffused ground state fluorophore with the electronic excited state fluorophore during its lifetime within van der W aals contact distances. On the other hand, in case of the static excimer, initially a pyrene dimer is formed in the ground state. After photo-excitation, the monomer units interact with each other at very close distances (3.5-3.9 Å in the case of polycyclic hydrocarbons) to form the excimer. Importantly, metal ion co-ordination with the ligand controls the separation and relative orientation of multiple fluorophore units attached to the ligands. For this reason, cation recognition is investigated by the monomer to excimer fluorescence intensity ratio.

        <p>In photoinduced electron transfer (PET), an excited electron is transferred from the donor to the acceptor. These ideas can also be explained with the help of molecular orbital energy diagrams when the molecular device is non-luminescent and luminescent (Fig. 3). The emission of photons from LUMO to HOMO after excitation of electrons is called fluorescence and the molecule is termed as a fluorophore. However, photoinduced electron transfer occurs when one electron from the HOMO of the electron donor is transferred efficiently to the hole in the HOMO of the fluorophore and the initially excited electron of LUMO moves to the HOMO of the electron donor. This event happens if the HOMO of the electron donor is higher in energy than the singly occupied orbital of the fluorophore HOMO. The PET mechanism leads to nonradiative deactivation of the excited state, and as a result the emission intensity is decreased or "quenching" of fluorescence is observed. [50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57] However, after interaction with metal ions, the donor electron containing orbital shifts its position from higher energy to lower energy and inhibits the electron-transfer process, resulting a radiative emission. In the case of metal ion binding, this effect is referred to as chelation-enhanced fluorescence (CHEF). 58 It is observed that in detection of Cu 2+ by the photo-induced electron transfer method, the pyrene containing chemosensor mostly exhibits weak fluorescence due to fluorescence quenching from nitrogen lone pairs onto pyrene. The binding of Cu 2+ with the ligand prevents the PET mechanism, resulting in significant enhancement in pyrene fluorescence.In photoinduced electron transfer (PET), an excited electron is transferred from the donor to the acceptor.

        <p>The chemosensors based on photoinduced charge transfer or internal charge transfers (ICT) are designed in which an electron withdrawing unit is conjugated with electron-donating substituents in the same molecule (Fig. 4). Therefore, the "push-pull" pi electron system of the chemosensor occurs in the excited state 59 and the charge transfer can occur over long distances through conjugation and is related with major dipole moment changes. This phenomenon is used for cation sensing, as the close interaction of cations with the donor or the acceptor moiety affects the photophysical properties of the fluorophore. 60 Cation complexation of an electron donor group within a fluorophore decreases the electron-donating character of the donor group and produces a blue shift in the spectrum due to reduction of conjugation. On the other hand, a red-shifted absorption spectrum is observed for metal ion binding to the acceptor group that enhances its electron-withdrawing character. 61 The fluorescence spectra should be shifted in the same direction as the absorption spectra. Receptors for the determination of Cu 2+ sensing are designed from this PCT mechanism by using either the electron-donating, electron withdrawing ability or Π-conjugation degree of the fluorophores.The chemosensors based on photoinduced charge transfer or internal charge transfers (ICT) are designed in which an electron withdrawing unit is conjugated with electron-donating substituents in the same molecule (Fig. 4).

        <p>Calixarenes are an important class of phenol-based macrocycles having some unique properties , specifically a nonpolar cavity , that are able to encapsulate various guest species, and possess well-defined conformations with tunable functionalization of their lower and upper rims. Like calixarene s , thiacalix [4]arenes containing bridging sulfur atoms with their 3-dimensional structure are an ideal platform for the development of chemosensor s . 62 T hiacalix [4]arenes appended with a pyrene moiety have been successfully designed utilizing the intensity ratio of the monomer to excimer emission (I M /I E ) of the pyrene moiety for the recognition of cations, anions or neutral molecules. 63 In 2013, Kumar et al . developed a heteroditopic receptor based on a thiacalix [4]arene possessing 1,3-alternate conformation. The receptor has two urea linked pyrene moieties and a crown-ether moiety at the opposite sides of the thiacalix [4]arene cavity , and this exhibited ratiometric fluorescence for the selective recognition of F -and CN -ions in THF. 64 In 2014, Yamato and te am established a heterodimeric system based on a thiacalix [4]arene possessing a 1,3-alternate conformation which was capable of binding K + ions and various anions via the crown-5-ring moiety and the two urea linked pyrene moieties in a CH 2 Cl 2 -DMSO solvent system. Moreover, a positive allosteric effect was observed for the formation of a heterogeneous dinuclear complex with Br -and K + ions and a negative allosteric effect induces the decomplexation of the K + ion from the crown-5 ring for the recognition of Cl -. 65 However, very few ratiometric fluorescence sensor s based on a thiacalix [4]arene ha ve been designed for the recognition of Cu 2+ . For this purpose, in 2015 the Yamato group d eveloped a ratiometric fluorescent chemosenso r 1 , in which an acetate group was introduced between the thiacalix [4]arene and triazolyl-pyrenyl groups in a 1,3-alternate conformation, which displays high selectivity toward Cu 2+ ions. 66 The free ligand 1 exhibits s trong face-to-face π-π stacking because of excimer emission at 484 nm and weaker monomer emissions at 379 and 397 nm. After gradual addition of Cu 2+ ions (up to 20 equiv.), the monomer to excimer relative emission intensity ratio of 1 +Cu 2+ increased 228-fold versus the monomer to excimer intensity ratio of the free ligand 1 , which was 0.54. The ligand 1 at low concentrations causes the excimer quenching and monomer enhancing due to the coordination bond of a Cu 2+ ions between the nitrogen atoms of the triazole ring and the adjacent oxygen atoms of 1 . This event forces the pyrenyl groups of 1 to move away from each other resulting in a conformational change. Notably, the monomer emission intensity of 1 was vividly reduced on addition of 5 to 45 equiv. of Cu 2+ ions in EtOH solution, and this can be explained by a reverse PET from the pyrene unit to the nitrogen atoms of the triazole ring or to a heavy atom effect at high ionic solution strength. A Job's plot for the ligand to Cu 2+ complexation revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry with the detection limit 1.44 × 10 -7 M. The IR spectra of 1 revealed that the strong absorption band for the triazole group had disappeared and the band for the -COO-group changed to a weak absorption after binding with Cu 2+ . Moreover, 1 H NMR titration experiments for 1 wer e also consistent with r eversibility characteristics as tested with Cu 2+ and ethylenediamine. By using Density Functional Theory (DFT) computational studies, the geometry-optimized energies of 1 with Cu 2+ complexes were calculated.Calixarenes are an important class of phenol-based macrocycles having some unique properties , specifically a nonpolar cavity , that are able to encapsulate various guest species, and possess well-defined conformations with tunable functionalization of their lower and upper rims. Like calixarene s , thiacalix [4]arenes containing bridging sulfur atoms with their 3-dimensional structure are an ideal platform for the development of chemosensor s . 62 T hiacalix [4]arenes appended with a pyrene moiety have been successfully designed utilizing the intensity ratio of the monomer to excimer emission (I M /I E ) of the pyrene moiety for the recognition of cations, anions or neutral molecules. 63 In 2013, Kumar et al . developed a heteroditopic receptor based on a thiacalix [4]arene possessing 1,3-alternate conformation. The receptor has two urea linked pyrene moieties and a crown-ether moiety at the opposite sides of the thiacalix [4]arene cavity , and this exhibited ratiometric fluorescence for the selective recognition of F -and CN -ions in THF. 64 In 2014, Yamato and te am established a heterodimeric system based on a thiacalix [4]arene possessing a 1,3-alternate conformation which was capable of binding K + ions and various anions via the crown-5-ring moiety and the two urea linked pyrene moieties in a CH 2 Cl 2 -DMSO solvent system. Moreover, a positive allosteric effect was observed for the formation of a heterogeneous dinuclear complex with Br -and K + ions and a negative allosteric effect induces the decomplexation of the K + ion from the crown-5 ring for the recognition of Cl -. 65 However, very few ratiometric fluorescence sensor s based on a thiacalix [4]arene ha ve been designed for the recognition of Cu 2+ . For this purpose, in 2015 the Yamato group d eveloped a ratiometric fluorescent chemosenso r 1 , in which an acetate group was introduced between the thiacalix [4]arene and triazolyl-pyrenyl groups in a 1,3-alternate conformation, which displays high selectivity toward Cu 2+ ions. 66 The free ligand 1 exhibits s trong face-to-face π-π stacking because of excimer emission at 484 nm and weaker monomer emissions at 379 and 397 nm. After gradual addition of Cu 2+ ions (up to 20 equiv.), the monomer to excimer relative emission intensity ratio of 1 +Cu 2+ increased 228-fold versus the monomer to excimer intensity ratio of the free ligand 1 , which was 0.54. The ligand 1 at low concentrations causes the excimer quenching and monomer enhancing due to the coordination bond of a Cu 2+ ions between the nitrogen atoms of the triazole ring and the adjacent oxygen atoms of 1 . This event forces the pyrenyl groups of 1 to move away from each other resulting in a conformational change. Notably, the monomer emission intensity of 1 was vividly reduced on addition of 5 to 45 equiv. of Cu 2+ ions in EtOH solution, and this can be explained by a reverse PET from the pyrene unit to the nitrogen atoms of the triazole ring or to a heavy atom effect at high ionic solution strength.

        <p>H omooxacalix [3]-arenes with a basic C 3 -symmetric cavity are related to calixarenes and crown ethers. Recently, homooxacalix [3]-arene s appended with pyrene functionality have also been u sed for the development of novel fluorescence chemosensors. 67 Our group reported a new type of fluorescent chemosensor based on a homooxacalix [3]arene which is connected with a pyrene moiety through a triazole group. The sensor exhibits great sensitivity and selectivity for the recognition of Pb 2+ compared with most other competitive metal ions apart from Cu 2+ where quenching was observed in an aqueous organic solvent system. 68 Bearing this in mind, we developed a novel ratiometric chemosensor 2 using a pyrene linked triazole modified homooxacalix [3]arene for the recognition of Hg 2+ and Cu 2+ . 69 The free ligand 2 exhibited fluorescence monomer and excimer emissions at wavelengths of 396 and 485 nm, respectively. The fluorescence spectral changes of the chemosenso r 2 showed that the excimer and monomer emission of pyrene was dramatically quenched in the presence of Cu 2+ and Hg 2+ ions in pure acetonitrile solution. Interestingly, the monomer emission of 2 appeared to enhance during the addition of Cu 2+ and Hg 2+ to the organic/aqueous solutions. The time-dependent fluorescence spectral changes explained the detailed information of monomer enhancement of the 2 +Hg 2+ and 2 +Cu 2+ complexes at 396 nm in the presence of 5% water in acetonitrile solution. The binding phenomenon was further confirmed by m atrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and by 1 H NMR spectroscopic titration experiments. The participation of water molecules in the complexation procedure of 2 with Hg 2+ and Cu 2+ inhibits the heavy atom effect and thereby the enhancement of monomer emission is observed. Similar phenomenon was observed using CH 3 OH, CH 3 CH 2 OH or 4,4′-bipyridine as solvent/melt for the 2 +Cu 2+ and 2 +Hg 2+ complexes.H omooxacalix [3]-arenes with a basic C 3 -symmetric cavity are related to calixarenes and crown ethers.

        <p>Hexahomotrioxacalixarenes are defined as a class of synthetic macrocycles with phenolic units connected by CH 2 OCH 2 bridges. By introducing different ionophores , homotrioxacalix [3]arene s ha ve been used as potential receptors. 70 The Yamato group incorporated a 2,2´-bipyridyl group attached via a carbonyl group at the upper rim and a diethylacetamide group at the lower rim of the hexahomotrioxacalix [3]arene that serve d as a tritopic recepto r for Ag + , Li + and Na + ions in a cooperative fashion. 71 Another representative example was reported by taking advantage of the excellent fluorescent properties of pyrene. Herein, we synthesized a pyrene-armed hexahomotrioxacalix [3]arene 3 as a ratiometric fluorescent sensor for the selective and sensitive detection of Cu 2+ via a Zn 2+ or Cd 2+ triggered synergistic effect in a CH 3 CN/CH 2 Cl 2 solvent system. 72 Furthermore, the ligand 3 with Cu 2+ plays a vital role as an indirect sensor for F -recognition through demetallation. In this case, the fluorescence spectra of 3 in CH 3 CN/CH 2 Cl 2 exhibit a comparatively strong excimer emission at 518 nm and a weak monomer emission at 415 nm, with an intensity ratio of monomer to excimer emission of 0.09. The addition of Cu 2+ ions to a solution of 3 leads to a significant increase in the monomer emission and a comparative decrease in the excimer emission to reveal a ratiometric change from 0.09 to 4.36. These spectral changes of sensor 3 with Cu 2+ can be a scribed to the cooperating effect of the geometrical structural changes and the reduced PET effect. The complex follows a 1:1 stoichiometry with a binding constant (3.57±0.1) × 10 5 M -1 . Furthermore, the 3 +Cu 2+ complex displays a highly sensitive response at 415 nm to both Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ through a synergistic effect. In this case, the quantum yield of the 3 +Cu 2+ complex is considerably greater than before (from 0.05 to 0.19) upon addition of Zn 2+ or Cd 2+ . From the fluorescence and NMR spectroscopic titration experiments, the following c an be proposed: (i) the nitrogen atom of ligand 3 interacts with both Cu 2+ and Zn 2+ . The Cu 2+ coordination with nitrogen of 3 inhibits the electron transfer from the nitrogen to the photo-excited pyrene moieties, resulting in the enhancement of monomer emission. (ii) The presence of both Zn 2+ and Cu 2+ further decreases the electron density at the nitrogen atom which leads to the significant increase in the monomer emission intensity of the pyrene moieties and forms a trimer complex. However, spectral changes suggest that ligand 3 can sequentially recognize Cu 2+ and F -through a two-step process, namely a complexation approach between 3 and Cu 2+ , and then a Cu 2+ displacement approach by F -to form CuF 2 . Therefore, s ensor 3 can act as a multifunctional molecular device by constructing a fluorescence-based combinational logic gate using the Cu 2+ , Zn 2+ /Cd 2+ and F -fluorescence responses. Li and co-workers have reported a pyrene based novel ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for Cu 2+ containing thiophene, namely compound 4 (see figure 8). 73 The monomer to excimer conversion of c hemosensor 4 occurred on gradual addition of Cu 2+ , owing to intermolecular π-π stacked dimerization of the two pyrenes. The fluorescent emission of 4 (10 µM) in t ris-HNO 3 buffer solution with high sensitivity and selectivity increases 127-fold with 2 equiv. of Cu 2+ (20 µM). In addition, the detection of Cu 2+ present in environmental samples such as river and pond water has been determined by the use of 4 . Moreover, cytotoxicity tests on 4 (from 0 µM to 20 µM) using cells showed that more than 96% of the cells were viable which establish the real applicability of the chemosensor 4 in biological samples. The association constant (K a ) for Cu 2+ binding by chemosensor 4 was determined to be 2.18 × 10 4 M -1 . There was a good linear relationship covering 1.0 × 10 -7 to 2.0 × 10 -5 M between the fluorescence ratio (I 460 /I 375 ) of 4 and the concentration of Cu 2+ with a detection limit of 2 × 10 -8 M.Hexahomotrioxacalixarenes are defined as a class of synthetic macrocycles with phenolic units connected by CH 2 OCH 2 bridges.

        <p>Two new chemosensors bearing either a single 5 or two 6 pyrene units linked by a flexible polyoxaethylene bridge have been developed that are sensitive to water and metal cations. 74 Compound 5 in dioxane showed a single monomer absorption and emission band, whilst compound 6 gave an absorption band in the 400-500 nm region with an emission band with maxima at ∼ 500 nm. In dioxane/water mixtures with xH 2 O = 0.29, the two probes exhibited a new band (with maxima varying from 405 to 490 nm) due to exciplex formation. Time-resolved experiments have been used to explain a two-state system for ligand 5 , which involves the monomer and a charged species, which can potentially be assigned to an exciplex-like species, whereas with 6 , a three-state system is involved. After addition of the metal ions (Cu 2+ , Zn 2+ and Ag + ) to probe 5 in dioxane followed by absorption and emission studies, a gradual quenching effect of the monomer emission was observed and this was significantly selective for Cu 2+ . In case of ligand 6 , after the interaction with metal cations, the emission band decreases at approximately 550 nm and the monomer emission band increases at ∼ 450 nm. The binding ratio of ligand ( 5 and 6 ) to metal was proposed to be a 1:1 stoichiometry. A pentiptycene-bispyrenyl system 7 was developed from the reaction of pentiptycene hydroquinone with 1-bromomethylpyrene. 75 Yang et al . reported compound 7 as a selective and sensitive fluorescent chemosensor for Ca 2+ Cd 2+ and Cu 2+ . The fluorescence spectra of compound 7 exhibited typical monomer emission at 375 and 395 nm and an excimer emission at 475 nm in CH 2 Cl 2 . In particular, upon addition of Cu 2+ , a strong blue shifted (from 475 to 440 nm) pyrene excimer emission was observed with increased intensity. This behaviour of sensor 7 was clarified by the excitation spectra which clearly showed a significant red shift at Cu 2+ -induced 440 nm than 375 nm, due to the conversion of a partially overlapping static excimer from a sandwich-like dynamic excimer. Moreover, the 7 +Cu 2+ complex at 440 nm has a short fluorescence lifetime (approximately 16-times) in comparison with 475 nm excimer emissions , which was explained by observation of the fluorescence decay times. Therefore, the radiative decay rate constant was larger for the static emission at 440 nm than the dynamic emission at 475 nm. In this case, Cu 2+ binding with 7 brings the pyrene groups together in the ground state for the formation of static excimers and minimizes the relaxation event in the excited state leading to a blue-shifted excimer emission. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of ligand 7 also exhibited a clear broadening of the spectrum with four defined isobestic points at 325, 331, 339 and 348 nm and suggested a 1:1 complex with a binding constant of 4.4. Kim et al. reported the mono -pyrenylalkylamine derivative 8 . 76 Upon addition of Cu 2+ , chemosensor 8 exhibited band broadening and a red-shift (from 342 to 455 nm) in a mixed solvent system of CH 3 CN/H 2 O (1:1). These observations were explained by favourable intermolecular π -π stacking dimerization of the two pyrenes in the ground state. In the Job's plot measurements, the maximum point appeared at the mole fraction of 0.6, which suggested a 2:1 ligand-to-metal complex. Fluorescence spectral changes of 8 revealed high selectivity toward Cu 2+ over other competitive species (Li + , Na + , K + , Rb + , Cs + , Mg 2+ , Ba 2+ , Ca 2+ , Sr 2+ , Ag + , Zn 2+ , Cd 2+ , Hg 2+ and Pb 2+ ) .

The coordination behaviour was examined with variations in length of the methylene groups ( n = 0, 1, 3) between the pyrene and quinolinylamide groups of 9 -11 toward Cu 2+ by fluorescence spectroscopy and theoretical DFT calculations. 77 Addition of Cu 2+ to ligand 9 ( n = 0) produced a new broad emission band which supports strong static excimer emission at 460 nm, whilst the binding constant was found to be 5.42 × 10 5 M -1 . Moreover, compound 9 interacts with Cu 2+ following a 2:1 stoichiometry as deduced from the Job's plot analysis, mass spectra and fluorescence behaviour. A DFT study confirmed that the minimum intramolecular distance between the pyrene and quinoline amide is the main factor for Cu 2+ ion detection. In the presence of 10 equiv. of Cu 2+ , the excimer emission intensity of 9 became approximately 8 times greater than that of probe 10 and 11 ( n = 1, 3).

        <p>A pyrene containing Schiff base fluorosensor 12 has been developed which showed high selectivity and sensitivity towards Cu 2+ ions. 78 This was due to the hindrance of the PET process upon complexation of the pyrene moiety with Cu 2+ through interaction of the nitrogen lone pair electron of 12 with Cu 2+ that induced the intermolecular excimer formation. The free ligand 12 exhibited two weak broad emissions centred at 385 nm and 452 nm in t ris-HCl (10 mM, pH = 7) buffer containing CH 3 CN-H 2 O (v/v = 1:1) medium which were assigned due to monomer and excimer of the pyrene moieties respectively. Moreover, the presence of Cu 2+ triggered a noticeable enhancement (10 fold) of the excimer peak at 452 nm along with two prominent monomer peaks at 378 and 396 nm. The detection limit of the sensor 12 was found to be 4 × 10 -8 M. The emission property of 12 (5 µM) was dependent on the nature of the solvent, and was enhanced on increasing the concentration of water up to 80% and there after reduced at 90% water fraction. Moreover, since some active groups (e.g. -NH 2 ) are present in the probe which are sensitive to H + ions, there is an effect of pH on the fluorescent response of the probe. Lin and co-workers have designed a simple pyrene containing derivativ e as a Cu 2+ turn-on chemosenso r 13 . 79 The probe 13 in CH 3 CN revealed a greater photoluminescence intensity enhancement at 459 nm for Cu 2+ (Φ= 0.284) versus other different metal ions (Li + , Ag + , K + , Na + , Cs + , Ni 2+ , Fe 3+ , Co 2+ , Zn 2+, Cd 2+ , Pb 2+ , Ca 2+ , Cr 3+ , Mg 2+ , Cu 2+ , Mn 2+ , Hg 2+ , Fe 2+ and Ag + ). The sensing mechanism involves heter oa toms (O and N) to form the excimer in which one Cu 2+ binds with two N and two O (one N and one O from one molecule). The 2:1 stoichiometry of the 13 +Cu 2+ complex was calculated from Job's plots based on UV-Vis absorption titrations. Moreover, the 13 +Cu 2+ sensor was found to be active over a wide range of pH (1-14). After 10 minutes, the relative fluorescence intensity changes for 13 +Cu 2+ reached a maximum value and so the system is effective with respect to time (0-10 minutes). The detection limi t (LO D ) of 13 with Cu 2+ was calculated at 9.72 × 10 -7 M. Similarly, based on fluorescent binding isotherms, the association constant (K a ) of the complex was estimated at 1.96 × 10 6 M -1 . A novel fluorescent chemosensor 14 , made up of pyrene units connected by a binaphthyl-crown derivative was designed and prepared for the selective detection of Cu 2+ in the presence of other metal cations (Ca 2+ , Cd 2+ , Co 2+ , Cs + , Cu 2+ , Hg 2+ , K + , Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Na + , Ni 2+ , Pb 2+ , and Zn 2+ ) in acetonitrile solution. 80 Compound 14 (l µM) shows monomer and excimer emissions at 376 and 477 nm respectively for excitation at 342 nm. Addition of Cu 2+ produced a new blue shifted excimer emission band centered at 447 nm with increasing intensity maximum up to 3-fold. The sensor 14 exhibits static excimer emission characteristics upon addition of Cu 2+ that can be easily understood from excitation spectra. Here, the emission at 477 nm resulted from a dynamic excimer due to the identical excitation spectrum at both the monomer wavelength (376 nm) and the excimer wavelength (477 nm). The excitation spectrum of ligand 14 with Cu 2+ monitored at 447 nm was significantly red-shifted compared with the spectrum taken at 376 nm which was attributed to the 447 nm from the static excimer. Moreover, from the fluorescence titration experiments, the association constant of 14 with Cu 2+ was determined to be 65,600 M -1 . [4]-arene bearing amine groups appended with pyrene moieties and a crown-4 ring. 81 The receptor 15 can detect Cu 2+ ions selectively among other metal ions with a detection limit of 40 × 10 -9 mol L -1 and follows a 1:2 stoichiometry of ligand to Cu 2+ complexation. It shows negative allosteric behaviour between Cu 2+ /Li + ions in mixed aqueous media. The binding behaviour of compound 15 was studied by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy which suggests the Cu 2+ ions interact with the amino nitrogen centres and Li + ions co-ordinate to the crown ether ring of receptor 15 . The excimer emission band of receptor 15 (1.0 μM; EtOH-H 2 O; 8:2, v/v) for the pyrene moieties was clearly observed at 466 nm due to the fully overlapped position of the two pyrene units resulting in the folded conformation of 15 . Notably, after gradual addition of only Cu 2+ ions, the monomer fluorescence emission at 378 nm shows a major enhancement with a remarkable decrease in the excimer emission intensity and the variation of these emissions l e d to the formation of an isoemissive point at 430 nm. This ratiometric behaviour of receptor 15 in the presence of Cu 2+ ions was due to the decreased electron density at nitrogen leading to the conformational changes that moved the overlapped pyrene units away from each other.A pyrene containing Schiff base fluorosensor 12 has been developed which showed high selectivity and sensitivity towards Cu 2+ ions. 78 This was due to the hindrance of the PET process upon complexation of the pyrene moiety with Cu 2+ through interaction of the nitrogen lone pair electron of 12 with Cu 2+ that induced the intermolecular excimer formation. The free ligand 12 exhibited two weak broad emissions centred at 385 nm and 452 nm in t ris-HCl (10 mM, pH = 7) buffer containing CH 3 CN-H 2 O (v/v = 1:1) medium which were assigned due to monomer and excimer of the pyrene moieties respectively. Moreover, the presence of Cu 2+ triggered a noticeable enhancement (10 fold) of the excimer peak at 452 nm along with two prominent monomer peaks at 378 and 396 nm. The detection limit of the sensor 12 was found to be 4 × 10 -8 M. The emission property of 12 (5 µM) was dependent on the nature of the solvent, and was enhanced on increasing the concentration of water up to 80% and there after reduced at 90% water fraction. Moreover, since some active groups (e.g. -NH 2 ) are present in the probe which are sensitive to H + ions, there is an effect of pH on the fluorescent response of the probe. Lin and co-workers have designed a simple pyrene containing derivativ e as a Cu 2+ turn-on chemosenso r 13 . 79 The probe 13 in CH 3 CN revealed a greater photoluminescence intensity enhancement at 459 nm for Cu 2+ (Φ= 0.284) versus other different metal ions (Li + , Ag + , K + , Na + , Cs + , Ni 2+ , Fe 3+ , Co 2+ , Zn 2+, Cd 2+ , Pb 2+ , Ca 2+ , Cr 3+ , Mg 2+ , Cu 2+ , Mn 2+ , Hg 2+ , Fe 2+ and Ag + ). The sensing mechanism involves heter oa toms (O and N) to form the excimer in which one Cu 2+ binds with two N and two O (one N and one O from one molecule). The 2:1 stoichiometry of the 13 +Cu 2+ complex was calculated from Job's plots based on UV-Vis absorption titrations. Moreover, the 13 +Cu 2+ sensor was found to be active over a wide range of pH (1-14). After 10 minutes, the relative fluorescence intensity changes for 13 +Cu 2+ reached a maximum value and so the system is effective with respect to time (0-10 minutes). The detection limi t (LO D ) of 13 with Cu 2+ was calculated at 9.72 × 10 -7 M. Similarly, based on fluorescent binding isotherms, the association constant (K a ) of the complex was estimated at 1.96 × 10 6 M -1 . A novel fluorescent chemosensor 14 , made up of pyrene units connected by a binaphthyl-crown derivative was designed and prepared for the selective detection of Cu 2+ in the presence of other metal cations (Ca 2+ , Cd 2+ , Co 2+ , Cs + , Cu 2+ , Hg 2+ , K + , Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Na + , Ni 2+ , Pb 2+ , and Zn 2+ ) in acetonitrile solution. 80 Compound 14 (l µM) shows monomer and excimer emissions at 376 and 477 nm respectively for excitation at 342 nm. Addition of Cu 2+ produced a new blue shifted excimer emission band centered at 447 nm with increasing intensity maximum up to 3-fold. The sensor 14 exhibits static excimer emission characteristics upon addition of Cu 2+ that can be easily understood from excitation spectra. Here, the emission at 477 nm resulted from a dynamic excimer due to the identical excitation spectrum at both the monomer wavelength (376 nm) and the excimer wavelength (477 nm).

        <p>A novel pyrene containing chemosensor 16 which possesse s a self-assembled 3D crystal structure via C-H…π, π…π and different types of H-bonding interactions, has been designed for the efficient and selective detection of Cu 2+ and F -ions in a dual sensing mode which do not interfere to each other. 82 The sensor 16 can recognize Cu 2+ by fluorimetric experiments and by visual colour changes under UV-light. The emission spectra of sensor 16 (1 × 10 -7 M) in a methanol-water mixture (methanol:water 7:3 v/v) shows, on changing the concentration, a local emission band at 466 nm which remains almost unchanged, whilst the band at 530 nm was continuously altered indicating the formation of excimers. After addition of Cu 2+ to the sensor 16 , a de crease of the excimer bands at 520 nm and 560 nm was initially observed as a result of interaction of the copper with the sensor and then the 16 +Cu 2+ complex causes an increment of the band at 466 nm. The above phenomenon can be explained by an excimer switch-off mechanism for promoting complexation with Cu 2+ . A Benesi-Hildebrand plot and Job's plot from UV-vis titrations demonstrated that the stoichiometry of the complex formed by 16 and Cu 2+ is 1:1 with a binding constant of 4.8 x 10 6 M -1 . In order to confirm the binding phenomena, the structure and electronic properties of 16 and its copper complex 16 +Cu 2+ have been investigated by Density Functional Theory (DFT). Moreover, the sensor 16 has potential for biological applications when detecting Cu 2+ as it overcomes the membrane barrier of living cells (HEK 293 cells). 83 These lipids can interact with transition metal ions via a variety of metal-chelating head groups such as iminodiacetate (IDA), EDTA, DTPA. However, all the lipids ( 17 -20 ) in DMSO solution failed to show the presence of any excimers in the emission spectra.A novel pyrene containing chemosensor 16 which possesse s a self-assembled 3D crystal structure via C-H…π, π…π and different types of H-bonding interactions, has been designed for the efficient and selective detection of Cu 2+ and F -ions in a dual sensing mode which do not interfere to each other. 82 The sensor 16 can recognize Cu 2+ by fluorimetric experiments and by visual colour changes under UV-light.

        <p>They can form liposomes (2.0 mg/ mL) under standard liposome formation conditions. The emission spectrum of 17 showed that both pyrene monomers (395 nm) and excimers (470 nm) were present in the liposomes in which the excimer to monomer intensity ratio (0.69) clearly indicated that lipid 17 was aggregated in the liposomes. Upon treatment with Cu 2+ , the overall fluorescence intensity of the liposomes decreased due to quenching of the excited states of the pyrene monomer by Cu 2+ compared to the pyrene excimer, leading to an increase in excimer-to-monomer ratio. Similar behaviour was also observed for liposomes from 17 -19 except 20 which showed very little change. Other transition metal ions (Ni 2+ , Hg 2+ a nd Zn 2+ ) did not show any response in the excimer to monomer intensity ratio. Another pyrene-appended ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor 21 has been reported by Yamato and coworkers in 2015. In this case, the homooxacalix [3]arene acts as a molecular spacer incorporating three pyrene fluorophore at the upper rim and three substituted triazole arms as ionophore at the lower rim. 84 The sensor 21 can serve as a ratiometric chemosensor for heavy and transition metal (HTM) ions (Cu 2+ , Hg 2+ , Pb 2+ and Zn 2+ ) resulting in a conformational change for 21 . The fluorescence emission spectra of free 21 show a characteristic pyrene excimer band at 482 nm in CH 3 CN solution. The interaction of 21 with Cu 2+ and other HTM ions led to the enhancement of monomer emission accompanied by excimer quenching. Herein, the ditopic calixarene as a molecular spacer prevents the heavy atom effect of the HTM ion by insulating the fluorophore from the ionophore through a long distance. The association constant for 1:1 complexation of 21 +Cu 2+ was calculated to be 1.89 × 10 5 M -1 . FT-IR spectra of the chemosensor 21 have been recorded, and the absorption band of C-O present on the lower rim is shifted at 1184 cm -1 whereas no absorption band change is observed for C=O at the upper rim of 21 upon complexation with Cu 2+ .

        <p>Receptor molecules have been designed for the enhancement of fluorescence intensity upon binding with a metal ion through the photoinduced electron transfer mechanism. 85 In 2015 , based on the photoinduced electron transfer mechanism, our group developed 7-tert -butylpyrene-appended fluorescent sensors containing dipicolylamine (Dpa) linkages. 86 Both the mono-chelate and bis-chelate ligan d showed selectivity for Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ ion s . Herein, we explai n that th e binding phenomenon of both ligands towards Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ va ried on changing the solvent system. However, the addition of Cu 2+ showed almost no fluorescence enhancement yet the Cu 2+ quenched the fluorescence of the bis-chelate ligand and Zn 2+ complex , which c an be explained by the paramagnetic nature of Cu 2+ . For the selective and sensitive detection of Cu 2+ , our group designed and synthesized three new fluorescence 'off-on' chemosensors 22 -24 based on pyrene containing Schiff base derivatives with different chain lengths . 87 C ompound 22 was synthesized from the condensation reaction of 1-pyrene carbaldehyde with 4-(hydrazidocarbonyl)( N, N -diethylaminocarbonylmethoxy)benzene. The other compounds 22 and 23 were easily synthesized via condensation reactions, and were compared against 22 towards Cu 2+ in terms of binding ability. The probe 22 (1.0 µM) was highly sensitive for the Cu 2+ detection due to s trong inhibition of PET. After addition of Cu 2+ , the emission intensity was enhanced approximately 65 times more (Φ= 0.31) than that of the free ligand 22 (Φ= 0.01), and was 57 times and 40 times greater than free 23 and 24 , respectively. A Job's plot analysis was carried out at 405 nm in which the fluorescence intensity showed a maximum at the mole fraction 0.5 which corresponds to a 1:1 ratio of ligand and Cu 2+ complex. The resulting association constant for 22 was found to be 1.29 × 10 5 ±0.32 M -1 . A DFT computational study together with 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectroscopic titration experiments revealed that Cu 2+ was bound at the imine nitrogen atom and the amide carbonyl oxygen of ligands 22 and 23 . The diethylaminocarbonylmethoxy group o f 22 provides a contribution for 22 and Cu 2+ complexation through an inductive effect. A pyrene derivative containing a benzothiazolenhydrazone receptor as a fluorescent sensor 25 was reported by Wang and Wu. 88 Upon addition of Cu 2+ (25 µM), probe 25 (50 µM) exhibited a significant fluorescence enhancement at 468 nm in acetonitrile-water (v/v = 3/1, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.0) from which the limit of detection of chemosensor 25 was estimated to be 2.73 µM.

This was responsible for the change of colour from yellowish to deep orange. The fluorescence intensity of 26 (2.5 × 10 -5 M) in CH 3 CN i ncreased upon addition of Cu 2+ ( I complex / I free ligand = 22-fold), where the excimer emission shifted from 450 to 429 nm.

The colour of 28 also changed from yellow to colourless. Moreover, free ligand 28 exhibited very weak fluorescence (Φ= 0.0045) due to a photoinduced electron transfer mechanism from the lone pair electrons of the two-nitrile groups to pyrene. However, the Cu 2+ -bound probe 28 inhibited the electron withdrawing ability of the two-nitrile groups and showed a sharp emission peak at 417 nm (Φ = 0.59) under excitation of 350 nm in acetonitrile-water.

        <p>A Schiff-base fluorescent compound 30 was developed by exploiting the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process for the detection Cu 2+ ions. 93 Ligand 30 (4 × 10 -6 M) shows weak fluorescence because of photoinduced electron transfer. The fluorescence intensity was remarkably enhanced after gradual addition of Cu 2+ ions (0-65 equiv.) to the chemosensor 30 in DMSO-H 2 O (1:1 v/v, HEPES = 50 mM, pH= 7.4). From the emission intensity data, the detection limit of chemosensor 30 +Cu 2+ system was found to be 0.26 × 10 -6 M with an association constant 1.16×10 4 M -1 . A Job's plot experiment showed that 30 to Cu 2+ complex followed a 1:1 binding model. Treatment of chemosensor 30 with various metal ions such as Pb 2+ , Ce 3+ , Cd 2+ , La 3+ , Mg 2+ , Zn 2+ , Ba 2+ , Bi 2+ , Hg 2+ , Fe 3+ , Ag + , Ni 2+ , Cr 3+ , Ca 2+ , Mn 2+ , Na + , K + , Co 2+ , Zr 2+ , Li + , Sr 2+ , Fe 2+ , Al 3+ and Th 4+ (100 equiv.) resulted in insignificant changes in the fluorescence intensity, which indicate high selectivity of 30 towards the Cu 2+ ion. Time-dependence fluorescence intensity indicated that sensor 30 completely binds with Cu 2+ ion within 5 min. Moreover, the bio-imaging and spectroscopic methods confirmed its detection ability for Cu 2+ ions in living cells. Patra and co-workers have developed a chemosensor 31 containing a benzilmonohydrazone moiety for the detection of Cu 2+ . 94 The chemosensor 31 exhibited a significant colour chang e from yellow to colourless in the presence of 10 equiv . of Cu 2+ ions. The binding properties of 31 were further investigated by fluorescence titration experiments in acetonitrile-water (2/1, v/v). The fluorescence quantum yield increased from 0.035 to 0.67 after gradual addition of Cu 2+ . In this case, Cu 2+ is coordinated with the outer azino nitrogen atom of the ligand 31 , which inhibits the PET mechanism. The detection limit of 31 based on fluorescent-titration experiments was found to be 7.8 nM for Cu 2+ . The 1:1 stoichiometric complexation between 31 and Cu 2+ was observed by 1 H NMR spectroscopic data, the Job's plot and the ESI-MS spectrum. The ligand 31 was efficiently applied in real samples for the recognition of Cu 2+ over the wide pH range of 4-11. A new 2-aza-1,3-butadiene ionophore which connects two pyrene groups has been synthesized and studied as a colorimetric and fluorescent chemosensor 32 for Cu 2+ ions. 95 The UV-vis and fluorescence measurements illustrated the binding mechanism of receptor 32 (c= 2.5 × 10 -5 M) with several metal cations (Li + , Na + , K + , Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ , Zn 2+ , Cd 2+ , Hg 2+ , Pb 2+ , Sm 3+ , Eu 3+ , Yb 3+ and Lu 3+ ) in CH 3 CN. The receptor 32 showed selective changes for Cu 2+ and Hg 2+ ions with a visible colour change by naked eye detection. Compound 32 exhibits a very weak fluorescence due to photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching from the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom in the 2-azadiene bridge to the excited state of the pyrene moiety when excited at 350 nm (Φ= 0.014). Upon addition of Cu 2+ to 32 , a chelation enhanced fluorescence intensity (CHEF) as well as excimer emission band was observed which was 27 times stronger in acetonitrile and 2.7 times stronger in an acetonitrile/water (7:3) solvent system. Moreover, the detection limit in both solvent systems was 10 -6 M with a 1:1 stoichiometric of 32 to Cu 2+ complex. A new fluorescent chemosensor 33 incorporating 1-nitronyl nitroxide pyrene has been developed as an off-on sensor for the selective recognition of Cu 2+ . 96 As a Cu 2+ selective sensor, the fluorogenic behaviour of 33 (10 mM) was investigated in CH 3 CN in which a weak fluorescence signal at 378 nm for the free solution of 33 r emarkably increased at 444 nm after addition of 10.0 equiv. of Cu 2+ . This phenomenon can be explained by the inhibition of PET from nitronyl nitroxide to the pyrene moiety. An ESR experiment confirmed the inhibition caused by the c oo rdination between Cu 2+ and nitronyl nitroxide of 33 . On the other hand, the fluorescence intensity of 33 showed no significant changes with various other metal ions (Li + , Na + , Ba 2+ , Fe 3+ , Fe 2+ , Mn 2+ , Mg 2+ , Ag + , Pb 2+ , Cd 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Zn 2+ , Hg 2+ ). Moreover, the absorbance s at 345 nm and 276 nm reduced sharply and increased at 402 and 295 nm and w ere accompanied with four well-defined isosbestic points, which indicated 33 +Cu 2+ complexation ; the colour changed from purple to bright yellow. In contrast, a reversible absorption response was observed at 345 nm by t itration of 2,2´-bipyridine with the 33 +Cu 2+ complex, which resulted in the recovery of the colour which is probably due to a stronger coordination between Cu 2+ and 2,2´-bipyridine. Furthermore, the Job's plot calculated a 1:1 binding ratio between Cu 2+ and 33 with a detection limit of 3.60 × 10 -7 M in CH 3 CN.A Schiff-base fluorescent compound 30 was developed by exploiting the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process for the detection Cu 2+ ions. 93 Ligand 30 (4 × 10 -6 M) shows weak fluorescence because of photoinduced electron transfer. The fluorescence intensity was remarkably enhanced after gradual addition of Cu 2+ ions (0-65 equiv.) to the chemosensor 30 in DMSO-H 2 O (1:1 v/v, HEPES = 50 mM, pH= 7.4). From the emission intensity data, the detection limit of chemosensor 30 +Cu 2+ system was found to be 0.26 × 10 -6 M with an association constant 1.16×10 4 M -1 . A Job's plot experiment showed that 30 to Cu 2+ complex followed a 1:1 binding model. Treatment of chemosensor 30 with various metal ions such as Pb 2+ , Ce 3+ , Cd 2+ , La 3+ , Mg 2+ , Zn 2+ , Ba 2+ , Bi 2+ , Hg 2+ , Fe 3+ , Ag + , Ni 2+ , Cr 3+ , Ca 2+ , Mn 2+ , Na + , K + , Co 2+ , Zr 2+ , Li + , Sr 2+ , Fe 2+ , Al 3+ and Th 4+ (100 equiv.) resulted in insignificant changes in the fluorescence intensity, which indicate high selectivity of 30 towards the Cu 2+ ion. Time-dependence fluorescence intensity indicated that sensor 30 completely binds with Cu 2+ ion within 5 min. Moreover, the bio-imaging and spectroscopic methods confirmed its detection ability for Cu 2+ ions in living cells.

        <p>The calix [4] crown fluorescent chemosensor 34 bearing two facing pyreneamide groups has been designed based on the photoinduced charge transfer (PCT) mechanism. 97 After addition of Pb 2+ or Cu 2+ , probe 34 showed fluorescence quenching in both the excimer and monomer emissions owing to reverse PET and conformational changes. The 34/ Cu 2+ complex gave a significant red-shifted excitation spectrum in an acetonitrile solvent system at the excimer wavelengt h 470 nm in comparison with monomer wavelength 380 nm, which suggests that the two-pyrene groups form the static excimer. Moreover, in both the fluorescence and absorption spectra, wavelength shifts of 34 are noted on binding of Cu 2+ with the nitrogen atoms of the amide groups, resulting in a PCT mechanism.The calix [4] crown fluorescent chemosensor 34 bearing two facing pyreneamide groups has been designed based on the photoinduced charge transfer (PCT) mechanism. 97 After addition of Pb 2+ or Cu 2+ , probe 34 showed fluorescence quenching in both the excimer and monomer emissions owing to reverse PET and conformational changes.

        <p>The LMCT process occurs in a complex when electrons are transferred from a molecular orbital (σ, σ*, π, π* and non -bonding) of the ligand to the empty or partially filled metal d-orbitals. Therefore, a reduction of the metal occurs in LMCT transitions. In this case, this type of transfer predominantly occurs in case of ligands having relatively high energy lone pairs atoms (example O, S or Se) or when the metal has low lying empty orbitals. The LMCT based fluorescent sensors depend on the selection of chromophore such as a pyrene unit, along with the nature and location of the receptor. The metal ion binding with a receptor will generally lead to a change in the absorption spectra or quenching of the fluorescence of the pyrene fluorophore. 98 In 2017, Lu and co-workers d eveloped c hemosensor 35 by combining p yrene with a pyridine unit based on LMCT which exhibited high selectivity for Cu 2+ and Fe 3+ over other ions. 99 Sensor 35 exhibited stable absorption or fluorescence intensity over a wide range of pH from 3 to 12. Addition of Cu 2+ to ligand 35 partially quenched the emission of the fluorophore through electron and/or energy transfer processes due to its paramagnetic nature with an unfilled d shell. DFT calculations of 35 +Cu 2+ also fully confirmed the LUMO was distributed more over the C=N bond and receptor rather than the pyrene unit after binding with Cu 2+ , than that of the free compound 35 . The UV-vis absorption spectra of 35 in DMF-HEPES buffer (2:8, v/v, pH = 7.4) showed a red shift (21 nm) from 352 nm to 373 nm after addition of 40 equiv. of Cu 2+ with an optical colour change from colourless to pink. The limit of detection toward Cu 2+ was 8.5 µM. The Job's plot experiment revealed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry for 35 and Cu 2+ . Another example of the LMCT mechanism was shown in the pyrene-based turn-off chemosensor 36 that was synthesized from the condensation reaction of 1-aminopyrene and 2,4-dihydroxy benzaldehyde. 100 Sensor 36 exhibited high selectivity for recognizing Cu 2+ ion in the presence of other metal ions. The UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy of 36 with Cu 2+ exhibited a hypsochromic shift for the absorption peaks at 368 nm and 340 nm with the formation of two isosbestic points in MeCN/H 2 O (9:1, v/v). Meanwhile, in aqueous medium, the solution colour of 36 changed from yellow to brown even at lower concentration s of Cu 2+ , and this was also directly observed by the naked eye. Moreover, the emission peak at 429 nm of 36 (20 µM) was gradually quenched after treatment with Cu 2+ in which the quenching efficiency was 93%. This phenomenon is due to the ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) characteristics resulting in the quenching of the fluorescence chemosensor 36 with Cu 2+ . The time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy also confirmed the static quenching mechanism for 36 +Cu 2+ . A Job's plot experiment and ESI-mass spectroscopic analysis revealed a 2:2 stoichiometry for binding of 36 with Cu 2+ . The lower limit of detection of Cu 2+ by 36 is 0.503 µM. The sensor 36 +Cu 2+ underwent a reversibility test in the presence of histidine and regained its original colour. Therefore, the sensor 36 can be utilized in real samples to investigate trace amounts of copper.The LMCT process occurs in a complex when electrons are transferred from a molecular orbital (σ, σ*, π, π* and non -bonding) of the ligand to the empty or partially filled metal d-orbitals.

        <p>A ligand sometimes has a donor and an acceptor site simultaneously. The intra ligand charge transfer transition ILCT takes place within the ligands mediated by a metal. In most instances, these complexes exhibit long-lived excited states with low-energy absorptions. Generally, this kind of chemosensor is fluorescent in the presence of a metal ion. 101 Using the above technique, Mukherjee et al . reported a new simple, reversible, turn-on luminescent chemosensor, namely the hydrazone based pyrene derivative 37 for the detection of Cu 2+ . 102 The binding of the receptor 37 with Cu 2+ was studied in DMSO/H 2 O (2:1) medium, and the generation of new peaks at 512 nm (broad) and 345 nm through isosbestic points was evident with a colour change from yellow to reddish brown. The emission intensity of 37 was enhanced at 495 nm up to 44-fold upon addition of Cu 2+ in DMSO solvent due to intra ligand charge transfer transition (ILCT). The other metal ions (Hg 2+ , Pb 2+ , Cd 2+ , Ni 2+ , Co 2+ , Fe 2+ , Fe 3+ , Mn 2+ , Zn 2+ , Al 3+ and Cr 3+ ) causes no significant change in the emission intensity of 37 . The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be of the order of 10 -8 M. DFT experiments revealed that the electron spin density was focused only in the pyrene moiety for all the frontier molecular orbitals which also supports the ILCT process. The compound 37 can extract Cu 2+ with 94% extraction efficiency over the pH range 6.5-11 from an aqueous mixture of metal ions or from real samples by a selective two-phase liquid-liquid extraction using a water-dichloromethane mixture (1:1). During extraction, the 37 +Cu 2+ complex was found to have a 2:1 ratio of ligand and Cu 2+ .

        <p>In an AIE luminogen, the intramolecular rotations of aromatic compounds are active in dilute solutions, which serve as a relaxation channel for its excitons resulting in non-radiative decay. However, in the aggregate state, the intramolecular rotations are suppressed because of the physical constraints, which opens the radiative pathway to emit efficiently. In the crystalline state, m ultiple C-H-π hydrogen bonds are formed between the hydrogen atoms of the aromatic rings of one ligand and the π electrons of the aromatic rings of another ligand. These hydrogen bonds stiffen the conformations of the ligand and enhance their light emission. 103 For these special characteristics of light emission, Wang and co-workers have used AIE or an AEE luminogen to develop chemosensors of type 38 for Cu 2+ ion detection. 104 In this case, pyrene acted as the strong fluorophor e and was combined with Schiff bases which were responsible for the AIE properties in semi-aqueous solution toward Cu 2+ . The AEE behaviour of 38 (10 µM) was explained by measurement of the fluorescence spectra in different volumes of water in mixed H 2 O/DMF (from 0% to 100 %,) solution. The experiment suggests that with increasing percentage of water the peak continually showed a red shift because of amide-amidic acid tautomerization with water in the aggregation state of 38 . Time-resolved fluorescence measurements supported the above observations. Sensor 38 became strongly emissive at 455 nm in the presence of Cu 2+ (5 eq.) with a quantum yield Φ from 0.09 to 0.58 in H 2 O/DMF (1:1, v/v). The UV-vis absorption spectroscopy also established that self-assembly of 38 (10 µM) prompted by Cu 2+ involves a coordination interaction and changes in the aggregation form.

        <p>An other example of aggregate formation was observed in a pyrene-based hydrophobic hydrocarbon framework in a binary water-solvent system. 105 Das et al . have reported a chemosensor 39 in which the pyrene part acts as a fluorescence reporter and the antipyr e ne part containing the pyrazolone unit plays the role of a chelating moiety. Sensor 39 exhibited very weak fluorescence due to a photoinduced electron transfer mechanism (PET) between N donors in the imine bond and the pyrene ring. Upon interaction with Cu 2+ , a fluorescence enhancement of 39 was observed at 454.5 nm along with 440 nm and 509 nm , which indicated complex formation due to prevention of the PET process by an N donor site in acetonitrile solvent. Time fluorescence titration revealed the maximum fluorescence enhancement of 39 was observed at 432 nm (blue shift) up to the addition of 150 μM of Cu 2+ ion. However, with an increasing percentage of water in the acetonitrile solvent system, the fluorescence emission intensity of 39 gradually increased at 454.5 nm with a red shift with poor intensity in pure acetonitrile. At 80% of water fraction, there was 230 times increase in the emission intensity with a red shift of 16 nm. This was because of the aggregation induced emission (AIE) characteristics of probe 39 . The critical aggregate concentration of ligand 39 in this solvent system was calculated to be 23.4 μM.

        <p>The development of chemodosimeters that operate on the basis of analyte selective chemical reactions has attracted great attention in the last few years. Among them, Cu 2+ -selective reaction-based probes show significant fluorescence emission enhancement with high selectivity. In this case, Cu 2+ -assisted hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction and spirolactam ring-opening methods have been used for building Cu 2+ -selective reaction-based probes. Generally, fluorescent sensors of this type lead to non-emissive precursors to fluorescent products through irreversible chemical reactions. It is noticeable that Cu 2+ induced-catalytic reactions to develop fluorescent sensors are the easiest way to avoid the consideration of the paramagnetic nature of Cu 2+ as fluorescent products have a slight attraction to Cu 2+ . 106 Using this concept, Chang et al . have reported a chemosensor 40 in which the pyrene moiety acts as a fluorophore and a fluorescence-quenching hydrazide moiety plays the role of a signaling handle. 107 The pyrenecarbohydrazide probe 40 displayed high selectivity towards Cu 2+ ions via Cu 2+ -induced catalytic hydrolysis to pyrenecarboxylic acid and hydrazine. 1 H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry also confirmed the hydrolysis of probe 40 . It exhibited very weak fluorescence due to PET which was remarkably enhanced (130-fold) at 392 nm upon a ddition of Cu 2+ in 10% aqueous DMSO solution ( t ris-buffered at pH 7.0). Moreover, the Cu 2+ selective fluorescence signaling behaviour of 40 was less prominent as the space between the hydrazide functionality and the pyrene fluorophore increased. P robe 40 has wide application in environmentally related samples, especially for semiconductor waste water sample over a wide pH range. The detection limit of 40 for Cu 2+ was 5.93 × 10 -8 M and 6.93 ×10 -8 M (0.005 ppm) in the waste water sample.The development of chemodosimeters that operate on the basis of analyte selective chemical reactions has attracted great attention in the last few years.

It is noticeable that Cu 2+ induced-catalytic reactions to develop fluorescent sensors are the easiest way to avoid the consideration of the paramagnetic nature of Cu 2+ as fluorescent products have a slight attraction to Cu 2+ . 106 Using this concept, Chang et al . have reported a chemosensor 40 in which the pyrene moiety acts as a fluorophore and a fluorescence-quenching hydrazide moiety plays the role of a signaling handle. 107 The pyrenecarbohydrazide probe 40 displayed high selectivity towards Cu 2+ ions via Cu 2+ -induced catalytic hydrolysis to pyrenecarboxylic acid and hydrazine. 1 H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry also confirmed the hydrolysis of probe 40 . It exhibited very weak fluorescence due to PET which was remarkably enhanced (130-fold) at 392 nm upon a ddition of Cu 2+ in 10% aqueous DMSO solution ( t ris-buffered at pH 7.0). Moreover, the Cu 2+ selective fluorescence signaling behaviour of 40 was less prominent as the space between the hydrazide functionality and the pyrene fluorophore increased. P robe 40 has wide application in environmentally related samples, especially for semiconductor waste water sample over a wide pH range. The detection limit of 40 for Cu 2+ was 5.93 × 10 -8 M and 6.93 ×10 -8 M (0.005 ppm) in the waste water sample.</p>
        <p>Rhodamine derivatives as chemosensors for Cu 2+ detection were first utilized by Czarnik in 1997. Even now, they are used for the detection of cations and anions given their excellent photophysical properties and the ring opening process. In general, the carbonyl group in the rhodamine spirolactam form gets activated by complexation with specific metal ions using certain solvent systems and pH. 108 Kim et al. introduced a novel fluorescent sensor, a rhodamine based derivative bearing a 1,8-naphthalimide group which perform ed as a dual-mode sensor for Cu 2+ by using two mechanisms, one is the rhodamine ring-opening mechanism and the other, a ratiometric displacement from Zn 2+ complexation with the ligand in CH 3 CN-HEPES buffer solution. 109 In 2009, Yoon et al. reported a rhodamine fluorophore combined with the pyrene moiety, which was utilized as a ratiometric and "off-on" fluorescent sensor 41 for the selective recognition of Cu 2+ . 110 Herein, the spirolactam structure (non-fluorescent) of the rhodamine derivative sensor 41 was converted into a ring-opened amide form by complexation with Cu 2+ and this gave rise to strong fluorescence emission and colour changes from primrose yellow to pink. From the fluorescence spectra, clear ratiometric changes of ligand 41 (20 μ M) were obtained upon treatment with Cu 2+ in CH 3 CN-HEPES buffer solution. A significant decrease of the fluorescence intensity of 424 nm and a new emission band at 575 nm, with a clear isoemission point was attributed to the Cu 2+ induced ring opening process of 41 . The absorption spectra of 41 showed prominent changes which were reversible by r eversible titration using EDTA/Cu 2+ . The 41 +Cu 2+ complex followed a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio which was calculated from the absorption spectra data of Job's plots and the nonlinear fitting of the titration curve.Rhodamine derivatives as chemosensors for Cu 2+ detection were first utilized by Czarnik in 1997.

        <p>behaviour of the metal-complexes is directly related to the periodic table and the electronic configuration of the metal ions. For example, the paramagnetic Cu 2+ ions have one electron in its dx 2 -dy 2 orbital which is responsible for fluorescence quenching through an electron or energy transfer process. As the energy of this orbital places between the HOMO and LUMO of the excited fluorophore, so a non -radiative decay of the excited fluorophore can easily occur. 19, 106b, 111 The free electron of Cu 2+ also has the tendency to quench the fluorescence via spin-orbit coupling that can be explained by heavy atom effect. The 'heavier' ions binding with the receptor increases the spin-orbit coupling, and hence leads to reduced fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes. 19,37b Periasamy et al. have described the fluorescen t chemosensor 42 bearing a pyrene and benzothiozole hydrazide, which shows considerably high fluorescence in the unbound state. 112 Upon complexation with the paramagnetic Cu 2+ ions, q uenching interactions probably dominate the emission characteristics of these complexes. The probe 42 displays high sensitivity and selectivity in DMSO-H 2 O (8:2 v/v) for Cu 2+ due to chelation with 42 . The ligand 42 +Cu 2+ ensemble shows high sensitivity towards S 2-ions. The UV-vis titration of 42 showed that the absorption bands at 395 and 410 nm gradually reduced and the band at 455 nm increased upon addition of Cu 2+ (0-100 μM). The association constant ( K a ) of 42 with Cu 2+ ions was found to be 2.3 × 10 5 M -1 . The change in the appearance of solution 42 from the yellow to brown colour was observed after the addition of Cu 2+ ions (100 μM) which can be seen by the naked eye. Moreover, the addition of Cu 2+ to the solution of 42 gradually quenched the fluorescence emission intensity at 510 nm which was explained by the paramagnetic nature and the chelation-enhanced fluorescence quenching (CHEQ) effect of the Cu 2+ ions. The ligand 42 was cell-permeable, and was efficiently utilized for the recognition of copper ions in live cell s and in real water samples.behaviour of the metal-complexes is directly related to the periodic table and the electronic configuration of the metal ions.

        <p>Similarly, quenching is promoted by paramagnetic Cu 2+ ions for its heavy atom effect in a pyrene-based dipicolylamine derivative sensor 43. 113 The compound 43 selectively recognized Cu 2+ and Fe 3+ over the other metal cations Ni 2+ , Mg 2+ , Cd 2+ , Hg 2+ , Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , Co 2+ , Cr 3+ , Pb 2+ and Zn 2+ . Upon treatment of Cu 2+ ions, sensor 43 exhibited well-defined absorption bands in MeOH solution in which a newly appeared band at 660 nm with red shifted peaks at 290, 333 and 358 nm were observed owing to the d-d transition of Cu(II). This phenomenon was distinguished by naked eye detection. From the results of UV-vis experiments, the stoichiometry of the Job's plot was found to be 1:1 with the binding constant 1.48 × 10 5 M -1 for the 43 +Cu 2+ system. Moreover, 1 H NMR spectroscopic titration experiments in CD 3 OD revealed that the seventeen aromatic protons of free receptor 43 in the 7.00-8.85 ppm region disappeared in the presence of Cu 2+ ions due to the paramagnetic effect of the Cu 2+ (d 9 system). The fluorescence spectrum of chemosensor 43 in methanol solution showed an emission band at 392 nm (Φ ~0.31) which was quenched significantly (Φ ~0.05). This behaviour was observed because of the efficient non-radiative deactivation by Cu 2+ , which resulted in the enhanced spin-orbit coupling associated with the heavy atom effect of the complexed Cu 2+ .Similarly, quenching is promoted by paramagnetic Cu 2+ ions for its heavy atom effect in a pyrene-based dipicolylamine derivative sensor 43. 113 The compound 43 selectively recognized Cu 2+ and Fe 3+ over the other metal cations Ni 2+ , Mg 2+ , Cd 2+ , Hg 2+ , Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , Co 2+ , Cr 3+ , Pb 2+ and Zn 2+ .

        <p>Pandey et al. investigated the difference in the photophysical properties of probes 44 , where coumarin-pyrene conjugates form with the non-conjugated form of probe 45 for the selective detection of Cu 2+ . 114 Herein, it was observed that the paramagnetic nature of the Cu 2+ ions have a great influence on the conjugated system of 44 rather than 45 . The probe 44 has a conjugated system exhibiting C-H-π , π-π interactions, and H-bonding interactions. Successive addition of Cu 2+ ions (1 µM-10 µM) results in the gradual quenching of fluorescence at 430 nm indicating the high sensitivity of probe 44 towards Cu 2+ ions. The phenomenon behind the quenching of fluorescence can be attributed to the combined effect of donation of π-electron from the fluorophore fragment to the adjacent metal ion and is due to the paramagnetic nature of the Cu 2+ ions. The binding constant of 44 with Cu 2+ was calculated to be 2.4 × 10 4 M -1 . Besides, sensor 45 showed no prominent change due to its non-conjugated form.

        <p>Y amato and co-workers have ascribed the reverse PET mechanism for the detection of paramagnetic Cu 2+ ions by the heteroditopic receptor 46. 115 As Cu 2+ has an unfilled d shell, it probably quenches the emission of the fluorophore via electron transfer. 116 The receptor 46 has a thiacalix [4]arene moiety with two different side arms in which two pyrene-appended triazole rings are incorporated at one side of the thiacalix [4] arene cavity and the other side contains two urea moieties with various phenyl groups. Herein, an effective positive allosteric effect of 46 was also observed for Ag + with Cl -. Besides, the UV-vis absorption, fluorescence spectra and 1 H NMR spectroscopic titration experiments of 46 showed changes in the presence of transition metal cations (Ag+, Cu 2+ and Hg 2+ ) and anions in the CH 2 Cl 2 -DMSO solvent system. The interaction of ligand 46 with Ag + ion increased the monomer emission at 393 nm and decreased the excimer emission at 486 nm with a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. Furthermore, upon addition of Cu 2+ , monomer and excimer emissions of free 46 were significantly quenched. This was because the binding with the pyrene-appended triazole groups caused a reverse PET from the pyrene moieties to the triazole groups.

        <p>Two new fluorescent sensors 47 , 48 based on thiacalix [4]arenes bearing two pyrene groups were developed by Kumar and co-workers for the recognition of Cu 2+ and CN -ions. 117 The authors reported that the former receptor 47 undergoes a reverse PET process, whereas the later 48 follows the monomer and excimer emission mechanism with a ratiometric response for Cu 2+ detection in CH 2 Cl 2 /CH 3 CN (1:1, v/v). Moreover, the UV-vis absorption spectra of both receptors upon interaction with Cu 2+ showed a decrease of the blue shift band and the formation of a new red shift band. This is because of the collaboration between the Cu 2+ ion with the nitrogen atoms of the amide groups which reduces the electron donating ability of the N atom and induces the red shift absorption spectra due to photoinduced charge transfer mechanism. The strong blue fluorescence of compound 47 indicates the typical monomer emission of pyrene at 377 nm which confirms there is no π-π interaction between two pyrene units. Upon addition of Cu 2+ ions (6.0-600 µM) to the solution of 47 (6.0 µM), the fluorescence emission intensity was significantly decreased due to reverse PET from the pyrene units to the nitrogen atom. The association constant K a of 47 with Cu 2+ was calculated to be 8.55 × 10 5 M -1 . On the other hand, the fluorescence properties of compound 48 were completely different compared with compound 47 . The compound 48 showed weak monomer emission at 375 nm and strong intramolecular excimer emission at 467 nm. Upon treatment with 60 mM (10 equiv.) of Cu 2+ ions, the titration profile of 48 exhibited a ratiometric response with monomer enhancement and excimer emission quenching. The relative intensity ratio of monomer to excimer emission (I M /I E ) of free ligand 48 was 0.47 and it increased by 11.7-fold to 5.52 on addition of Cu 2+ ion. A selectivity test of 47 and 48 was carried out in the presence of various metal ions with Cu 2+ which revealed 47 +Cu 2+ and 48 +Cu 2+ complexes to be selective chemosensors. This observation was in agreement with the 1:1 and 1:2 (H/G) binding model for 47 +Cu 2+ and 48 +Cu 2+ complexes respectively, which was also confirmed by the method of continuous variation (Job's plot).Two new fluorescent sensors 47 , 48 based on thiacalix [4]arenes bearing two pyrene groups were developed by Kumar and co-workers for the recognition of Cu 2+ and CN -ions. 117 The authors reported that the former receptor 47 undergoes a reverse PET process, whereas the later 48 follows the monomer and excimer emission mechanism with a ratiometric response for Cu 2+ detection in CH 2 Cl 2 /CH 3 CN (1:1, v/v).

        <p>A pyrene containing Schiff base colorimetric sensor 49 was synthesized via a simple one-pot reaction. 118 The probe 49 displayed high sensitivity and selectivity towards Cu 2+ and the sensitivity was not interfered with by the presence of other relevant metal ions. In the solvent mixture DMSO/H 2 O (v/v = 8/2, buffered with HEPES, pH = 7.4), the absorption peaks of probe 49 at 355 and 452 nm were slowly decreased on gradual addition of Cu 2+ and the peaks were blue-shifted to 326 and 410 nm with two isosbestic points at 349 and 414 nm, respectively with changes of colour from yellow to pale lemon. This phenomenon is due to the formation of the Cu 2+-assisted 49 -Cu 2+ -DMSO complex. The absorption spectrum on changing the Cu 2+ concentration indicated a 1:1 stoichiometry between the host 49 and the Cu 2+ ions. 1 H NMR spectroscopic titration experiments of 49 also found that the proton signal of the OH became broad and slightly shifted downfield with increasing Cu 2+ concentration.

        <p>In 2010, Yen and coworkers synthesized a novel colorimetric and fluorometric receptor 50 containing a pyrene unit and a 4-methylphenylthiourea moiety for selectively sensing Cu 2+ and Hg 2+ (Fig. 44). 119 The c oo rdination with Cu 2+ and Hg 2+ ion s sho w colour and fluorescence changes of 50 in aqueous solution (DMSO/H 2 O = 4/1, buffered with HEPES, pH 7.8) which allowed them to be distinguished from other metal ions. Moreover, the designed sensor 50 can recognize Cu 2+ through binding with the thiourea group. For this reason, the typical pyrene absorption bands of 50 in the region of 235-350 nm gradually increased at 278, 334 nm with a shoulder peak at 388 nm and decreased at 348 nm after addition of Cu 2+ . The colour of the 50 +Cu 2+ solution changed from pale yellow to green-yellow. Moreover, the enhancement of emission intensity (45 times more) at 396 and 439 nm was observed for 50 upon treatment with Cu 2+ ions, with a colour change from pale to strong blue.

        <p>Liu et al. have developed the pyrene based diaminomaleonitrile chemosensors 51 and 52 (1 × 10 -5 M) which can effectively sense Cu 2+ in acetonitrile-water solution (v/v = 1:1, 10 mM HEPES, pH = 7). 120 The absorption spectra of 51 exhibits a strong red-shifted band at approximately 421 nm from that of pure pyrene at around 355 nm. On the other hand, compound 52 showed the characteristic absorption band of pyrene at 342 nm and another strong band at 380 nm, owing to intramolecular charge transfer. Upon gradual addition of Cu 2+ to 52 (10 µM), the absorbance at 380 nm gradually decreased and the band centered at 280 nm increased, because of Cu 2+ interaction with diaminomaleonitrile moiety which prevents the charge-transfer of pyrene to the electron withdrawing diaminomaleonitrile moiety. This result has resemblance with the spectral changes of receptor 51 . 91 The receptors 51 and 52 exhibited weak fluorescence (quantum yields in acetonitrile are 0.005 and 0.02, respectively) because of having the Schiff base moiety and due to the overlap of the emission and absorption spectra. However, only ligand 52 gave a red-shifted band at around 590 nm except for the other band close to the characteristic emission band of pyrene. A significant fluorescence enhancement of 52 was observed at the emission band of pyrene on titration of Cu 2+ . The quantum yield of the fluorescence emission band of 52 +Cu 2+ complex was 0.42, approximately 20-times more than that of free 52 . The apparent association constant ( K a ) of Cu 2+ binding to 52 was estimated to be 5.2 × 10 3 M -1 . However, the authors observed that on changing the solvent system from CH 3 CN/H 2 O to PBS/DMF, the receptor cannot bind with Cu 2+ as DMF trapped the Cu 2+ and hindered the interaction between the ligand 52 and Cu 2+ . It is noteworthy to mention that Nand/or O-and/or S-containing ligands find more promise for the detection of Cu 2+ ions. However, there are very few chemosensors described with reversible properties, which is a weakness in this type of host-guest chemistry. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the need to recycle these resources to avoid waste generation. Besides, the design and synthesis of fully water soluble efficient pyrene chemosensor remains a challenging task for the detection of Cu 2+ . Most of the pyrene sensors in this article are found to be only partially soluble in water, on mixing with organic solvents like CH 3 CN, CH 3 OH, CH 2 Cl 2 . The addition of polar functional groups or polar moieties into the chemosensor may increase the water solubility and make it more efficient for sensing Cu 2+ in biological and environmental arenas. This review article helps to explore new concepts for designing and synthesizing chemosensors based on pyrene-derivatives and more significant achievements are anticipated in the near future.Liu et al. have developed the pyrene based diaminomaleonitrile chemosensors 51 and 52 (1 × 10 -5 M) which can effectively sense Cu 2+ in acetonitrile-water solution (v/v = 1:1, 10 mM HEPES, pH = 7). 120 The absorption spectra of 51 exhibits a strong red-shifted band at approximately 421 nm from that of pure pyrene at around 355 nm. On the other hand, compound 52 showed the characteristic absorption band of pyrene at 342 nm and another strong band at 380 nm, owing to intramolecular charge transfer. Upon gradual addition of Cu 2+ to 52 (10 µM), the absorbance at 380 nm gradually decreased and the band centered at 280 nm increased, because of Cu 2+ interaction with diaminomaleonitrile moiety which prevents the charge-transfer of pyrene to the electron withdrawing diaminomaleonitrile moiety. This result has resemblance with the spectral changes of receptor 51 . 91 The receptors 51 and 52 exhibited weak fluorescence (quantum yields in acetonitrile are 0.005 and 0.02, respectively) because of having the Schiff base moiety and due to the overlap of the emission and absorption spectra. However, only ligand 52 gave a red-shifted band at around 590 nm except for the other band close to the characteristic emission band of pyrene. A significant fluorescence enhancement of 52 was observed at the emission band of pyrene on titration of Cu 2+ . The quantum yield of the fluorescence emission band of 52 +Cu 2+ complex was 0.42, approximately 20-times more than that of free 52 . The apparent association constant ( K a ) of Cu 2+ binding to 52 was estimated to be 5.2 × 10 3 M -1 . However, the authors observed that on changing the solvent system from CH 3 CN/H 2 O to PBS/DMF, the receptor cannot bind with Cu 2+ as DMF trapped the Cu 2+ and hindered the interaction between the ligand 52 and Cu 2+ . It is noteworthy to mention that Nand/or O-and/or S-containing ligands find more promise for the detection of Cu 2+ ions. However, there are very few chemosensors described with reversible properties, which is a weakness in this type of host-guest chemistry. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the need to recycle these resources to avoid waste generation. Besides, the design and synthesis of fully water soluble efficient pyrene chemosensor remains a challenging task for the detection of Cu 2+ . Most of the pyrene sensors in this article are found to be only partially soluble in water, on mixing with organic solvents like CH 3 CN, CH 3 OH, CH 2 Cl 2 . The addition of polar functional groups or polar moieties into the chemosensor may increase the water solubility and make it more efficient for sensing Cu 2+ in biological and environmental arenas.
