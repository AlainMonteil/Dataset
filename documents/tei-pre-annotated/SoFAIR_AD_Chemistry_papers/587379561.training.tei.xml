        <p>The dyeing and finishing step represents a clear hotspot in the textile supply chain as the wet processing stages require significant amounts of water, energy, and chemicals. In order to tackle environmental issues, natural dyes are gaining attention from researchers as more sustainable alternatives to synthetic ones. This review discusses the topic of natural dyes, providing a description of their main features and differences compared to synthetic dyes, and encompasses a summary of recent research in the field of natural dyes with specific reference to the following areas of sustainable innovation: extraction techniques, the preparation of substrates, the mordanting process, and the dyeing process. The literature review showed that promising new technologies and techniques have been successfully employed to improve the performance and sustainability of natural dyeing processes, but several limitations such as the poor fastness properties of natural dyes, their low affinity with textiles substrates, difficulties in the reproducibility of shades, as well as other factors such as cost-effectiveness considerations, still prevent industry from adopting natural dyes on a larger scale and will require further research in order to expand their use beyond niche applications.The dyeing and finishing step represents a clear hotspot in the textile supply chain as the wet processing stages require significant amounts of water, energy, and chemicals.

        <p>The global textile industry is responsible for having a serious environmental impact across the entire supply chain, with remarkable greenhouse gas emissions (over 3.3 billion metric tons per year) [1], significant land and water consumption, pollution of the soil, air and water, and increasing waste production.The global textile industry is responsible for having a serious environmental impact across the entire supply chain, with remarkable greenhouse gas emissions (over 3.3 billion metric tons per year) [1], significant land and water consumption, pollution of the soil, air and water, and increasing waste production.</p>
        <p>The current linear system uses large amounts of resources, which creates significant negative impacts on ecosystems and people. It is estimated that every year, about 98 million tons of non-renewable resources are consumed, including, for example, fertilizers to grow natural fibers, oil to produce synthetic fibers, and chemicals used in different stages of textile production [2].The current linear system uses large amounts of resources, which creates significant negative impacts on ecosystems and people.

        <p>The dyeing and finishing steps represent a clear hotspot in the textile supply chain as the wet processing stages require large volumes of water to be heated and are especially energy intensive. The greenhouse gases emitted from burning fossil fuels to generate the heat and electricity required in these stages of textile production account for their high contribution to the climate impact. According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report on sustainability and circularity in the textile value chain, the contribution of dyeing and finishing to the climate impact of the textile field is accountable for 36% of the entire textile supply chain [3]. The consumption of water is also a major issue, and finishing processes consume great amounts of water, for example to prepare dye baths and wash fabrics after the dyeing process. It is estimated that every kg of cotton requires around 125 L of water to be dyed and finished [4]. Moreover, the dyeing and finishing stage relies heavily on hazardous chemicals and represents a hotspot in terms of carcinogenic human toxicity and a hotspot for non-carcinogenic human toxicity because of the use of detergents, dyes, and water-repellent agents [5].The dyeing and finishing steps represent a clear hotspot in the textile supply chain as the wet processing stages require large volumes of water to be heated and are especially energy intensive.

        <p>While promising innovations are emerging to reduce the impact of the dyeing step, such as low water or waterless dyeing processes and chemical-free technologies [6], there is a renewed interest in the topic of natural dyes as a more sustainable alternative to synthetic dyes and a way to reduce the usage of chemicals and the impact on the environment.While promising innovations are emerging to reduce the impact of the dyeing step, such as low water or waterless dyeing processes and chemical-free technologies [6], there is a renewed interest in the topic of natural dyes as a more sustainable alternative to synthetic dyes and a way to reduce the usage of chemicals and the impact on the environment.</p>

        <p>Synthetic dyes are derived from non-renewable sources, mostly petrochemicals. They have many different complex chemical structures and there are many products in commercial use [7]. It is estimated that globally every year about 800,000 tons of synthetic dyes are produced, and 75% of this amount is consumed by the textile industry [8].Synthetic dyes are derived from non-renewable sources, mostly petrochemicals.

        <p>Since their appearance on the market, synthetic dyes have been preferred to natural ones as they are easier to use, they do not require the use of mordants, and they allow to obtain fast, bright, and reproducible shades. However, they can contain insoluble impurities, or generate waste materials that require disposal [9].Since their appearance on the market, synthetic dyes have been preferred to natural ones as they are easier to use, they do not require the use of mordants, and they allow to obtain fast, bright, and reproducible shades.

        <p>Nevertheless, increasing environmental concerns have led researchers to investigate the harmful impacts of synthetic dyes on air, water, and soil. Slama et al. [10] illustrated the effects of toxic gasses released by textile factories such as sulfur derivatives, formaldehyde, oxides of nitrogen, as well as the effects of liquid and solid wastes released into the environment in non-treated or partially treated forms, which especially occurs in those developing countries with insufficient effluent discharge legislation and poor wastewater treatment systems. During the dyeing process, not all the synthetic dye is fixed onto the fabric and the unfixed dye is released into the environment through wastewater, representing a significant amount which is estimated to account for about 10-15% [8]. Usually, the concentration of dye residues in textile wastewater can amount to about 300 mg/L. The presence of dye can be noticed even when its concentration is inferior to 1 mg/L and can have devastating effects on aquatic ecosystems, such as affecting the transparency of water, thus preventing the transmission of light and inhibiting plants' photosynthesis, altering pH levels, and reducing the quantity of dissolved oxygen [10]. Wastewater from the dyeing process not only contains color but also other unfixed substances such as different auxiliaries, fixing agents, defoamers, oxidizing/reducing agents, and diluents [11]. According to Gürses et al. (2016), typical dye effluents contain high biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and are abundant in organic and inorganic pollutants such as chlorinated compounds, heavy metals, sulfur, nitrates, naphthol, soaps, chromium compounds, formaldehyde, benzidine, sequestering agents, dyes, and pigments [12].Nevertheless, increasing environmental concerns have led researchers to investigate the harmful impacts of synthetic dyes on air, water, and soil.

        <p>In addition to environmental impacts, some researchers have pointed out potential effects on human health, both for industry workers and final customers. Exposure to some types of dyes can potentially cause harm to human health, with some of them recognized as respiratory or skin sensitizers [7]. Among these, azo dyes, which were used to dye cotton and are now prohibited by several regulations in the EU, are considered carcinogenic, allergenic, and harmful to the reproductive system. Similarly, disperse dyes, normally used for dyeing synthetic fabrics, are known to have allergenic properties [13]. The European Commission studied the possible correlation between the chemicals used in textile finishing and allergic reactions, reporting that textile finish resins and other textile auxiliaries can Molecules 2023, 28, 5954 3 of 22 induce allergic contact dermatitis [14]. According to research carried out by the Italian Contact and Environmental Dermatitis Research Group, clothing accounts for 8.5% of non-occupational contact dermatitis, with it being the fourth most important cause [15].In addition to environmental impacts, some researchers have pointed out potential effects on human health, both for industry workers and final customers.

        <p>Natural dyes, on the other hand, are considered eco-friendly as they are sourced from renewable resources and are biodegradable. Natural dyes sources are generally classified into plants (e.g., indigo and madder), minerals (e.g., ochre and clay), animals (e.g., cochineal and some species of Mollusca) [16], and microbes, although plants are the most common source. Various parts of the plant can be used, such as the roots, leaves, twigs, stems, heartwood, bark, and wood [17].

Moreover, research has shown that natural dyes may lend several functional properties to textiles, such as antibacterial, antifungal, UV protective, insect repellent, and aromatic properties, due to a group of active biomolecules known as phytochemicals, which differ based on the plant considered as well as their mechanism of action. Kamboj et al. listed the major classes of microorganisms causing degradation to textiles, analyzed the key factors affecting the antimicrobial activity of natural dyed fabrics, reported the main phytochemicals responsible for the antimicrobial activity of natural dyes-such as saponins, tannins, flavonoids, glycosides, and anthocyanins-and their mode of action [19].Natural dyes, on the other hand, are considered eco-friendly as they are sourced from renewable resources and are biodegradable.

        <p>Despite the clear environmental advantages of using natural dyes, several authors have pointed out many technical issues and disadvantages which still prevent the industry from adopting them on a larger scale. A major source of concern for the industry is the poor fastness of natural dyes. Natural dyes show low dye uptake, poor fastness, and uneven dyeing. Mordanting substances-often metallic salts, which are not always environmentally sustainable-are needed to improve the fastness and to fix the dye to the fabric [18].Despite the clear environmental advantages of using natural dyes, several authors have pointed out many technical issues and disadvantages which still prevent the industry from adopting them on a larger scale.

Mordanting substances-often metallic salts, which are not always environmentally sustainable-are needed to improve the fastness and to fix the dye to the fabric [18].</p>
        <p>The type of bonding between dyes and fibers directly affects the fastness properties of dyed textiles. Synthetic fibers do not show affinity with natural dyes, which can only be used to dye natural fibers. Nevertheless, among the same natural fibers, protein fibers are easy to dye with natural dyes due to the presence of ionic groups in their structure, while cellulosic fibers are more difficult to dye as there is a lack of bonding between natural dyes and the fiber. Due to their poor substantivity, it is necessary to pretreat cellulosic fibers through a mordanting process [25].The type of bonding between dyes and fibers directly affects the fastness properties of dyed textiles.

        <p>Another critical issue is the reproducibility of shades, as the results obtained are related to numerous factors, such as the features of the natural dye matter, maturity, variety, agroclimatic conditions, soil type, and weather. Some natural dyes are pH sensitive; the difference in the mineral content and pH of the water used could also affect the results of the dyeing process. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve standardized and consistent results [17] although the uniqueness of the shades obtained could be considered as an added value for niche applications.Another critical issue is the reproducibility of shades, as the results obtained are related to numerous factors, such as the features of the natural dye matter, maturity, variety, agroclimatic conditions, soil type, and weather.

        <p>Moreover, the dyeing process with natural dyes is long and expensive and requires a considerable quantity of water and a significant amount of raw material to achieve the same depth of color as synthetic dyes [24]. Repeating dye batches to achieve the same shades implies significant consumption of water, dyestuff, and energy every time the process is repeated.Moreover, the dyeing process with natural dyes is long and expensive and requires a considerable quantity of water and a significant amount of raw material to achieve the same depth of color as synthetic dyes [24].

        <p>The availability of dye matter is also a matter of concern, depending on several factors such as seasonality. The available supply of natural dyes is just 1% of world demand (10.000 tons) [26]. Moreover, the consumption of land to grow raw materials to extract the dye and the use of pesticides on the crop may also affect the sustainability of the final fabric [27].The availability of dye matter is also a matter of concern, depending on several factors such as seasonality.

        <p>A more sustainable sourcing option-both in terms of environmental and economic sustainability-is represented by the usage of agro-industrial waste as renewable raw material for natural dye production. Phan et al. [28] explored the potential of natural dyes extracted from food waste by analyzing the amount of fruit and vegetables waste and by-products derived from agricultural losses and industrial processing in Europe and providing mapping based on the concentration of anthocyanins, quinones, and carotenoids in the waste and by-products examined. The authors considered several technological and methodological aspects, describing possible routes of valorization and concluding that food waste streams can be considered a competitive source to obtain natural dyes, especially in terms of niche applications.A more sustainable sourcing option-both in terms of environmental and economic sustainability-is represented by the usage of agro-industrial waste as renewable raw material for natural dye production.

        <p>Recently, studies on agro-industrial waste as a source to dye different textile substrates are multiplying, demonstrating both the environmental and economic benefits of adopting a circular approach [29][30][31][32]. Obtaining dyes from waste and by-products would be a preferable option in terms of production costs if compared to direct harvesting. Nevertheless, obtaining the same depth of color as primary agriculture dye matter with waste is still a challenge [33].Recently, studies on agro-industrial waste as a source to dye different textile substrates are multiplying, demonstrating both the environmental and economic benefits of adopting a circular approach [29][30][31][32].

        <p>The application of natural dyes on a large industrial scale will require the overcoming of numerous technical challenges, such as the improvement of extraction and application methods in order to increase their cost-effectiveness [34].

The advantages and disadvantages of natural dyes are summarized in Table 1.</p>
        <p>The extraction of colorant from natural sources is a fundamental step in preparing purified natural dyes, as a plant's matrix contains only a small percentage of dye, usually in the range of 0.5-5%, and several other constituents such as water-insoluble fibers, carbohydrates, protein, chlorophyll, and tannins, among others. The selection of the most suitable extraction technique should be based on the evaluation of the nature and solubility of the dyeing materials [17].The extraction of colorant from natural sources is a fundamental step in preparing purified natural dyes, as a plant's matrix contains only a small percentage of dye, usually in the range of 0.5-5%, and several other constituents such as water-insoluble fibers, carbohydrates, protein, chlorophyll, and tannins, among others.

        <p>Aqueous extraction is a traditional method in which dye matter is usually first reduced to small pieces or powdered and then immersed in water to loosen the cell structure and improve the efficiency of the process. The dye solution is obtained by boiling and then filtered.

        <p>Aqueous extraction is a sustainable and safe technique, and the extract can be easily applied to textiles. The disadvantages are its long extraction time, the large amounts of water required, and the low dye yield as only the water-soluble dye components are extracted.

        <p>Pervaiz et al.

        <p>Similar to aqueous extraction is extraction with organic solvents such as ethanol or methanol or a mix of solvents, which allows for a higher extraction yield, however. Lower temperatures can be used, limiting chances of degradation. Water/alcohol extraction can extract both water-soluble and water-insoluble components. Moreover, the solvents can be easily removed through distillation to be reused. Disadvantages include the presence of toxic residual solvents. Additionally, the extracted material is not readily soluble in water; the co-extraction of other substances such as chlorophylls and waxy materials could occur [17].Similar to aqueous extraction is extraction with organic solvents such as ethanol or methanol or a mix of solvents, which allows for a higher extraction yield, however.

Additionally, the extracted material is not readily soluble in water; the co-extraction of other substances such as chlorophylls and waxy materials could occur [17].</p>

        <p>Ultrasounds are defined as mechanical waves characterized by a frequency above 20 kHz (human hearing range). The waves can propagate in solids, liquids, and gasses through compression and rarefaction cycles. When high intensity waves propagate in a liquid medium, the negative pressure during the rarefaction phase is stronger than the force attracting molecules together, causing molecules' dispersion and the formation of cavitation bubbles. These bubbles grow until they collapse, generating the phenomenon known as cavitation, with an increase in temperature and pressure. Cavitation is an important mechanism exploited in the ultrasound-assisted extraction of bioactive compounds. As a matter of fact, the collapsing of bubbles causes a series of mechanisms such as erosion or pore formations, which can ultimately facilitate the breaking of plant matrix cells and the release and solubilization of compounds of interest [40].Ultrasounds are defined as mechanical waves characterized by a frequency above 20 kHz (human hearing range).

        <p>Supercritical fluids are defined as substances above their critical pressure and temperature which possess properties of both liquids and gasses. The critical values depend on the specific substance. When a gas is above its critical temperature and pressure, it is compressed in a supercritical fluid and is characterized by a density similar to that of a liquid, a viscosity similar to that of a gas, and a diffusion coefficient between liquids and gasses. Thanks to these properties, supercritical fluids possess high solvating power and diffusivity and low viscosity and surface tension. These characteristics allow for fast mass transfer in supercritical fluids. Consequently, in extraction with supercritical fluids (SFE) the mechanism of penetration of the solvent into the matrix is facilitated, resulting in a fast and efficient extraction process. Another advantage of supercritical fluids is that the changing pressure, temperature, and density affect the solubility of these substances [52]. Additionally, the density of the fluid can be modified by altering the pressure and temperature values. Therefore, in the extraction process with supercritical fluids, the solvent's strength can be also regulated by modifying the various parameters. Supercritical fluids' extraction comprises two main steps, which are the solubilization of the extract in the supercritical solvent and the consequent separation of the extract from the solvent. In the first stage, the absorption of the supercritical solvent by the plant matrix causes the swelling of its cellular membranes and a decrease in mass transfer resistance. At the same time, the extracted compounds are solubilized and move to the external surface of the cell. Afterwards, the solubilized compounds are transported from the surface of the cell to the solvent. Finally, in the last stage, they are removed from the supercritical solvent [53,54].Supercritical fluids are defined as substances above their critical pressure and temperature which possess properties of both liquids and gasses.

This is due to several reasons: firstly, carbon dioxide is non-toxic and non-flammable, and it is considered safe for human health and the environment in terms of manipulation and between certain value ranges. Secondly, it is available at high purity, at relatively low cost, and is easy to remove from the extract. Moreover, it has a low critical pressure and temperature (73 atm and 31.2 • C, respectively), factors that favor the preservation of the bioactive compounds contained in the extracts [53,55].Several solvents can be used as supercritical fluids, such as carbon dioxide, ethane, ethene, methanol, nitrous oxide, n-butene, n-pentane, sulfur hexafluoride, and water, although carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is the most commonly used, and it is estimated that more than 90% of all supercritical fluid extractions (SFEs) are carried out with CO 2 .

With the same dyestuff, different types of mordant generate different dye complexes and different results for color coordinates, color strength, and fastness values. Moreover, the moment in which the mordanting process takes place directly affects the results. This can be carried out prior to the dyeing process (pre-mordanting), at the same moment of the dyeing process (simultaneous/metamordanting), or as an extra step after the dyeing process (post-mordanting) [68].To overcome the poor substantivity and fastness properties of natural dyes, fabrics are traditionally treated with substances called mordants, used to form a stable dye-metal complex and fix the color to the fabric.

With the same dyestuff, different types of mordant generate different dye complexes and different results for color coordinates, color strength, and fastness values. Moreover, the moment in which the mordanting process takes place directly affects the results. This can be carried out prior to the dyeing process (pre-mordanting), at the same moment of the dyeing process (simultaneous/metamordanting), or as an extra step after the dyeing process (post-mordanting) [68].</p>
        <p>Traditional mordants used in natural dyeing have often been associated with risks to the environment, due to the presence of residuals in the wastewater after the dyeing process [69,70]. As a more environmentally friendly alternative to conventional metallic mordants, recent research has been exploring the use of biomordants, obtained from natural sources. In Figure 3, a classification of mordants is provided [68].Traditional mordants used in natural dyeing have often been associated with risks to the environment, due to the presence of residuals in the wastewater after the dyeing process [69,70].

        <p>A wide range of plants and biomaterials can replace the use of metallic mordants in the fixation of natural dyes onto fabrics, with their effectiveness strongly depending on their chemical structure and content. Biomordants include a wide range of substances, such as tannins, tannic acid, and tartaric acid. For example, several plants have been successfully used as biomordants due to their high content of tannins and chlorophyll [71]. Some plants known as hyperaccumulators (e.g., tea, camelia, club moss, and symplocos) are naturally capable of absorbing aluminum through their roots and can be used as biomordants [63]. Moreover, biomordants can also be obtained from biowastes and by-products [68].A wide range of plants and biomaterials can replace the use of metallic mordants in the fixation of natural dyes onto fabrics, with their effectiveness strongly depending on their chemical structure and content.

        <p>Rani et al. [76] studied the dyeing process of wool with papaya (Carica papaya L.) leaf as a natural dye and biomordants. The dye was extracted and reduced to dry powder. As for the mordant used, different metal salts (ferrous sulfate, alum, and copper chloride) were tested and compared to natural tannin extracts as biomordants (harda powder, pomegranate peel, orange peel, and amla powder).

        <p>Enzymes have been used in numerous textile processes such as desizing, scouring, bleaching, dyeing, and finishing as a more sustainable alternative to the currently used chemicals [81]. However, it is estimated that only about 75 enzymes are used in textile industry processes within the 7000 known [82]. For example, enzymes such as lipase, pectinase, xylanase and cellulase are commonly used in textile processes of pretreatment and finishing [83] in order to modify the physical and chemical properties of the fiber surface or introduce specific functional groups onto it [84]. Other examples include amylases, which are employed in desizing; cellulases, commonly used in denim finishing and the biopolishing of cellulosic fibers; proteases, used in leather, silk, and wool treatment; and pectinases-amylase, lipase, and diasterase-used in the biopreparation of cotton fabrics [85].Enzymes have been used in numerous textile processes such as desizing, scouring, bleaching, dyeing, and finishing as a more sustainable alternative to the currently used chemicals [81].

        <p>However, several studies have shown the efficacy of gamma-ray treatment on the improvement of dyeing processes with natural dyes. Cotton treated with gamma radiation and successively mordanted and dyed with red calico leaves extract showed improved color fastness properties. Different doses of gamma radiation were tested and resulted in differences in the color strength values. A dose of 15 kGy was found to be the optimum dose for cotton modification, as the hydroxyl group of cellulose units was transformed into a carboxylic group, allowing their interaction with the dye molecules [109].However, several studies have shown the efficacy of gamma-ray treatment on the improvement of dyeing processes with natural dyes.

        <p>Similarly, Gulzar et al. [101] applied acacia (Acacia sp.) bark extract to gammairradiated cotton. The authors exposed both cotton fabric and dye to gamma rays and tested different doses and dyeing variables, finding that 20 kGy was the most effective dose for cotton pretreatment. Moreover, abundant hydroxyl group one C-6 and two C-2, C-3 of the cellulosic group favored extensive hydrogen bonding, which led to good values of color strength and fastness.Similarly, Gulzar et al.

        <p>Accelerated electrons interact with polymeric materials through a process that involves physical, physicochemical, and chemical transformations. In the first stage, the electrons gradually transfer their energy to the polymeric material. This generates reactive species such as excited states, ions, and secondary electrons, which are then converted into polymer radicals. The two main mechanisms activated by EBI on polymeric materials are the formation of chemical bonding between polymer chains (cross-linking) and the degradation of polymer chains. EBI is similar to gamma radiation, although it varies in dose rates and penetration and presents additional advantages such as higher efficiency due to the directivity of the electron beam and easier management and maintenance of the radiation source. Moreover, it is an environmentally friendly, solvent-free, and fast process [110][111][112].Accelerated electrons interact with polymeric materials through a process that involves physical, physicochemical, and chemical transformations.

        <p>Elmaaty et al. [112] collected several studies on the EBI treatment of textile materials to enhance the properties of the fabric in the context of dyeing of different substrates (natural, synthetic, and regenerated fibers), and observed that many researchers found this technology effective in improving wettability, dyeability, color strength, and color fastness.Elmaaty et al.

        <p>In a previous study, Elmaaty et al. [113] used EBI pretreatment on different synthetic fabrics, namely polypropylene (PP), polyamide 6, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), to enhance dyeability with natural dyes (saffron and turmeric) (Figure 5). The variables studied included different exposure doses and oxidation periods in order to find the optimum conditions. The samples treated were analyzed and showed excellent durability and color fastness for roughness, rubbing, and washing. Another irradiation technology is plasma, which is defined as a partially ionized gas constituted by many types of species, such as positive and negative ions, electrons, neutrals, excited molecules, photons, and UV light [114].In a previous study, Elmaaty et al.

        <p>Plasma treatment is a fast and dry process which does not require solvents or water and requires no or very low amounts of chemicals. Therefore, the advantages of plasma include the reduction of water consumption, chemicals, energy, time, and waste produced. It introduces new functional properties and improves color fastness without affecting the bulk properties. A potential drawback is the high cost of some of the gases that can be used, specifically helium [91].Plasma treatment is a fast and dry process which does not require solvents or water and requires no or very low amounts of chemicals.

        <p>Haji et al. [119] investigated the effect of low-temperature oxygen plasma for the pretreatment of cotton before dyeing it with madder and weld extracts. It was found that plasma treatment greatly improved the dyeability of cotton and fastness properties with both natural dyes with and without mordant. Plasma affected the surface layer of cotton, generating an etching effect and removing impurities; at the same time, it allowed for the creation of carbonyl groups on the fabric surface so as to increase the dye uptake and the fastness properties of the treated samples.Haji et al.

        <p>Dyeing is defined as the aqueous application of color to fiber, yarn, or fabric. In addition to dyes, an industrial dyeing process requires the use of other auxiliary chemicals in order to obtain uniform colorations and acceptable fastness properties of the final product. Since dyeing is a wet process which involves the significant consumption of water and energy, research is constantly focused on developing efficient, more environmentally sustainable processes. To this extent, new technologies such as ultrasonic, microwave, plasma, supercritical carbon dioxide coloration, and nanotechnology have been employed to enhance the dyeing process [121].Dyeing is defined as the aqueous application of color to fiber, yarn, or fabric.

        <p>Ultrasounds have been employed to enhance several chemical and physical processes, thanks to the cavitation phenomenon. Improvements have been observed in ultrasoundassisted coloration processes, and numerous researchers have applied this technique to textile dyeing on different substrates [122][123][124]. Some studies have reported the use of ultrasound-assisted dye with natural dyes. Vankar et al. [85] studied the dyeing of cotton using Eclipta alba L. as a natural dye, comparing both conventional and sonicator methods. The latter method resulted in higher color strength values and better dye uptake.

        <p>In microwave-assisted dyeing, energy is absorbed directly by the dye molecules, inducing their oscillation which in turn favors the diffusion of dye in the fiber structure, unlike conventional heating methods in which heat is gradually transferred [125]. In one study, the dyeing of polyester fabric was performed using microwave energy and henna natural dye, and it was reported that the fixation (%), the rate of dye uptake, and the dyeing time were reduced up to 60-65% as compared to conventional heating [126].In microwave-assisted dyeing, energy is absorbed directly by the dye molecules, inducing their oscillation which in turn favors the diffusion of dye in the fiber structure, unlike conventional heating methods in which heat is gradually transferred [125].

        <p>Another technique that can be considered is the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as a solvent instead of water, allowing for a more environmentally friendly waterless dyeing process, as well as easier separation of the residual dye from the solvent [127].Another technique that can be considered is the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as a solvent instead of water, allowing for a more environmentally friendly waterless dyeing process, as well as easier separation of the residual dye from the solvent [127].</p>
        <p>Many studies have highlighted the advantages of using supercritical CO 2 in the dyeing process, especially for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) dyeing [128][129][130] and with dispersed dyes. The effectiveness of the supercritical fluid dyeing of PET with disperse dyes lies both in the fact that disperse dyes display higher solubility in supercritical CO 2 than in water and that CO 2 molecules can easily penetrate and swell the empty space between the polymer chains of PET, increasing their mobility through a phenomenon known as plasticization and therefore allowing for better diffusion of the dye. Since the first pilot-scale development of the process by UHDE GmbH in 1995, many other prototypes have been developed. In the last few years, companies such as DyeCoo and Hisaka have started producing and selling machinery for the dyeing of polyester in supercritical CO 2 . The Dutch company DyeCoo reports that each of their machines can process 800,000 kg of PET per year, with a significant saving of water (32 million L) and a drastic reduction in the consumption of chemicals (160,000 kg saved). Furthermore, about 95% of CO 2 can be recovered and reused after each process [131,132].Many studies have highlighted the advantages of using supercritical CO 2 in the dyeing process, especially for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) dyeing [128][129][130] and with dispersed dyes.
