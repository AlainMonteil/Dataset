        <p>1.1. Activated Carbon (AC). Activated carbon (AC) refers to the highly carbonaceous materials having high porosity and sorption ability produced from the wood, coconut shells, coal, and cones, etc. AC is one of the frequently used adsorbents utilized in various industries for the removal of numerous pollutants from water and air bodies. Since, AC synthesized from the agricultural and waste products, it has proved to be a great alternative to the traditionally used nonrenewable and expensive sources. For the preparation of AC, two basic processes, carbonization and activation, are used. In the first process, precursors are subjected to high temperatures, between 400 and 850 °C, to expel out all the volatile components. High elevated temperature removes all the noncarbon components from the precursor such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen in the form of gases and tars. This process produces char having high-carbon content but low surface area and porosity. However, the second step involves the activation of previously synthesized char. Pore size enhancement during the activation process can be categorized into three: opening of previously inaccessible pores, new pore development by selective activation, and widening of existing pores.1.1.

        <p>Usually, two approaches, physical and chemical, are used for activation to get desired surface area and porosity. Physical activation involves the activation of carbonized char using oxidizing gases such as air, carbon dioxide, and steam at high temperatures (between 650 and 900 °C). Carbon dioxide is usually preferred because of its pure nature, easy handling, and controllable activation process around 800 °C. High pore uniformity can be obtained with carbon dioxide activation in comparison to steam. However, for physical activation, steam is much preferred as compared to carbon dioxide since AC with relatively high surface area can be produced. Due to the smaller molecule size of water, its diffusion within char's structure occurs efficiently. Activation by steam has been found to be around two to three times higher than carbon dioxide with same degree of conversion.Usually, two approaches, physical and chemical, are used for activation to get desired surface area and porosity.

        <p>However, chemical approach involves the mixing of precursor with activating agents (NaOH, KOH, and FeCl 3 , etc.). These activating agents acts as oxidants as well as dehydrating agents. In this approach, carbonization and activation is carried out simultaneously at comparatively lower temperature 300-500 °C as compared to the physical approach. As a result, it effects the pyrolytic decomposition and, then, results in expansion of improved porous structure and high carbon yield. Major benefits of chemical over physical approach are the low temperature requirement, high microporosity structures, large surface area, and minimized reaction completion time.However, chemical approach involves the mixing of precursor with activating agents (NaOH, KOH, and FeCl 3 , etc.).

        <p>The superiority of chemical activation method can be explained on the basis of a model proposed by Kim and his coworkers [1] according to which various spherical microdomains responsible for the formation of micropores are found in the AC. On the other hand, mesopores are developed in the intermicrodomain regions. Experimentally, they formed activated carbon from phenol-based resin by chemical (using KOH) and physical (using steam) activation (Figure 1). Results showed that AC synthesized by KOH activation possessed high surface area of 2878 m 2 /g as compared to 2213 m 2 /g by steam activation. In addition, other factors such as pore size, surface area, micropore volume, and average pore width were all found to be better in KOH-activated conditions as compared to steam activated.The superiority of chemical activation method can be explained on the basis of a model proposed by Kim and his coworkers [1] according to which various spherical microdomains responsible for the formation of micropores are found in the AC.

        <p>Depending upon the particle size and method of preparation, it can be categorized into three types: powered AC, granular AC, and bead AC. Powered AC is formed from fine granules having size 1 mm with average diameter range of 0.15-0.25 mm. Granular AC has comparatively larger size and less external surface area. Granular AC are used for various liquid phase and gaseous phase applications depending upon their dimension ratios. Third class: bead AC is generally synthesized from the petroleum pitch with diameter ranging from 0.35 to 0.8 mm. It is known for its high mechanical strength and low dust content. It is extensively utilized in fluidized bed applications such as water filtration due to its spherical structure.Depending upon the particle size and method of preparation, it can be categorized into three types: powered AC, granular AC, and bead AC.

        <p>1.1.1. Surface Chemistry of AC. Surface chemistry of AC is greatly influenced by the type of heteroatom present on its surface such as nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and oxygen. The type of heteroatom present is determined from nature of activation process used. On the basis of type of group present, the surfaces of AC can be categorized into acidic and basic surfaces.1.1.1.

        <p>(1) Acidic AC. Groups present on the exterior surface determine the reactivity of AC. Presence of oxygen-containing compounds on the surface of AC contributes to its acidic character. Since the exterior sites constitutes the majority of adsorbent area, the concentration of such reactive groups influences the adsorption capability of AC to a great extent [2][3][4][5]. Oxygen-containing acidic groups include carboxylic, quinone, carbonyl, and pyrone, etc. Carboxylic groups can also exist in the form of carboxylic anhydride [6,7]. Carboxylic acid, lactone, and phenolic hydroxyl groups are categorized as the sources of surface acidity. AC contains oxygen functionalities by the oxidation of gases and aqueous oxidants [7,8]. For the gas phase treatment, oxygen, air, steam, and carbon dioxide can be used. During such processes, low temperature oxidations results into the development of strong acidic groups. However, high temperature oxidations create weak acid groups [9]. As compared to gas phase, liquid phase oxidation treatments can be used to introduce large amount of oxygen into the carbon moieties. Mixture of nitric acid and carboxylic acid exhibits strong oxidizing properties for introducing momentous oxygenated acidic functionalities such as carboxylic, phenolic hydroxyl, and lactone onto the AC surface [10]. Findings have validated that oxidation of AC in gas phase enhanced mainly due to the concentration of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups present on its surface; however, oxidation in liquid phase can integrate high amount of oxygen in the form of carboxylic and phenolic hydroxyl groups onto the AC surface at comparatively much lower temperatures in comparison to the gas phase oxidation.(1) Acidic AC.

        <p>(2) Basic AC. Basicity of activated carbon can be related to the resonating electrons of aromatic carbon rings and basic surface functionalities (e.g., nitrogen-containing groups) that are capable of binding with protons. In addition, some oxygen-containing functionalities such as ketone, pyrone, and chromene can also result into basic AC. In basic AC, present electrons act as Lewis bases. Increase in the quantification of nitrogen-containing groups increases the adsorbing ability of AC towards carbon dioxide. Nitrogencontaining functionalities can be hosted into AC either by reaction with nitrogen-containing reagents (such as NH 3 , nitric acid, or amines) or activation with nitrogencontaining precursors.

        <p>Adsorption is a surface phenomenon involving the adsorption of adsorbate molecules onto adsorbent. Basic principle involving the adsorption process is the variable surface energy. Urge to stabilize the surface energy results into interactions between the adsorbent surface and adsorbate molecules. Adsorption of pollutants onto adsorbent depends upon number of factors such as temperature, solution pH, adsorbate concentration, contact time, coexisting ions, temperature, and surface properties of adsorbent including maximum available surface area, pore size, and pore distribution. Adsorption can be classified into two categories: physical and chemical based on the type of interactions between adsorbate and adsorbent molecules. Chemical adsorption is categorized by the chemical interactions involving exchange of electrons between the two phases, thus forming permanent bonds and resulting in an irreversible process. However, physical adsorption involves the electrostatic, π-π interactions, Vander-Waal's interactions, or H-bonding, resulting into a reversible process [11,12].

        <p>The electrical characteristics of adsorbent surface can easily be determined using two methods; point of zero charge (PZC) and isoelectric point (IEP). PZC determines the solution pH at which the surface charge equals to zero. It can be determined using pH drift method or potentiometric titration, etc. However, IEP occurs when the electrokinetic parameter at shear planes equals to zero. Major difference between the two is that the IEP determines only the external surface charge of adsorbent but PZC determines its internal as well as external surface charge. Difference of the two determines the internal surface charge of adsorbent.The electrical characteristics of adsorbent surface can easily be determined using two methods; point of zero charge (PZC) and isoelectric point (IEP).

        <p>Mechanism of adsorption of various pollutants onto AC is very important to be elaborated. Mainly four processes are involved; (a) bulk transfer, (b) film diffusion, (c) pore diffusion, and (d) intraparticle diffusion. Bulk transfer involves the transport of adsorbate molecules in the solution phase and occurs instantaneously. In the film diffusion form, the adsorbate molecules are transferred to the external surface of adsorbent molecule by hydrodynamic boundary. Pore diffusion involve the transference of adsorbate molecules into the pores of adsorbent, thus decreasing the overall adsorption rate. Lastly, intraparticle diffusion involves the diffusion of adsorbate molecules from exterior of adsorbent into the pores of adsorbent and also along the pore-wall surfaces [36]. Figure 3 presents the probable adsorption mechanism. Various interactions play an important role in their adsorption such as bonding, electrostatic, and π-π and nπ interactions [37]. π-π interactions, also known as π-π electron donor-acceptor interactions, exist between π-electrons of AC and adsorbate molecules. Presence of electron withdrawing groups at the edges and surface of AC results into appreciable drop in the π electron density. Removal of metal cations by AC is generally favored by Cπ-cation interactions that exists between the π-electron cloud of AC and metal cations. For example, in 2015, Tran et al. synthesized biochar having properties similar to that of AC from orange peels by pyrolysis. Adsorption of cadmium ions onto biochar surface followed the Cπ-cation interactions with maximum adsorption capacity of 114.69 mg/g [38].

        <p>In addition to the above-reported interactions, hydrogen bonding also plays an important role in the adsorption of organic aromatic compounds onto AC. These interactions exist between the functional groups such as N-H in atrazine and O-H in paracetamol of the adsorbent and AC. Considering particular mechanism, O-H groups present on the surface of AC form hydrogen bond with the functional groups present in the organic adsorbates. Net intensity of the interactions regulates the magnitude of adsorption. In this mechanism, some complexes between solvent molecules and surface oxides are formed, which could block the migration of the solute molecules from the outside to the micropore structure of AC [40]. These interactions are highly temperature dependent as they vanish with the increase in temperature due to rise in kinetic energy of the adsorbed molecules.In addition to the above-reported interactions, hydrogen bonding also plays an important role in the adsorption of organic aromatic compounds onto AC.

        <p>Zinc is a transition metal with atomic number 30 which is quite essential for human health. Intake of zinc in excess amount causes serious issues such as skin irritations, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, and anemia. Another one is mercury which is neurotoxin that causes damage to the central nervous system. High concentrations of mercury cause impairment of pulmonary and kidney function, chest pain, and dyspnea, etc. One most common disease caused by the presence of mercury is Minamata Bay [45]. In addition to mercury, lead can also cause central nervous system damage. It can also affect the kidney, liver, and reproductive system and malfunctions the brain activities. The toxic side effects are anemia, headache, dizziness, insomnia, weakness of muscles, and renal damages [46]. Chromium occurs in environment in mainly two states: Cr(III) and Cr(VI), out of which is Cr(VI) which is highly toxic [47]. It affects human physiology, gathers in the food chain, and causes many health issues ranging from simple skin irritation to lung carcinoma [48].

        <p>Adsorption of Pb(II) and Cd(II) ions onto AC preactivated by physical (steam) and chemical treatment (H 3 PO 4 and KOH) was studied by El-Hendawy. Out of the three activation treatment processes, H 3 PO 4 chemical treatment activation was found to be the most effective with maximum adsorption capacity of 139 mg/g for Pb(II) and 129 mg/g for Cd(II). Pb(II) ions were removed or adsorbed in preference to Cd(II) ions due to their lower solubility and lower pH requirement for complexation [52]. Another group of researchers, Ameh synthesized activated carbon by chemical treatment with NaOH and utilized it for the adsorption of Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions. Maximum adsorption capacity calculated from Langmuir isotherm for Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions was 118.06 and 88.42 mg/g, respectively.

Specifically, pesticide is characterized by its exceptional chemical structure established to mimic and substitute specific molecules to the targeted pests, which offer a lethal disruption to the anticipated biological reactions [61]. Pesticides actually helps in diminishing the effect of unwanted microbes or other agents and helps in fulfilling the ever increasing food demands due to increasing world population. These can be applied to the agricultural field in the form of herbicides, insecticides, ovicides, rodenticides, fungicides, avicides, nematicides, and bactericides, etc [62,63].

        <p>2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is an herbicide that is used for the careful control of broadleaf weeds. Hameed et al. studied its removal from aqueous solution by employing AC treated with KOH/CO 2 for physiochemical activation. Various adsorption isotherms were employed, and results showed that Langmuir data fitted best. Maxi-mum adsorption capacity calculated was 238.10 mg/g. Herbicide initial concentration was of greater influence as compared to solution pH and other factors [69]. In 2006, Chingombe et al. [70] described the heat treatment via annealing the AC in a reactor that enhanced the micropore content, thus increasing the surface area from 790 to 960 m 2 /g due to the reduction in oxygen-containing functional groups. Such enhancement in surface area increased the uptake of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and benzolin onto its heat-treated AC. Adam et al. investigated the adsorption of a fungicide, propiconazole under two different activation treatments, one by basic treatment (NaOH) and other by acidic treatment (HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 ). Results presented that acidic treatment of AC decreased its adsorption abilities. Actually, acidic groups increased the oxygencontaining functionalities onto the surface that showed negative effect on adsorption of propiconazole as a result of which the adsorption capacity decreased [71]. Yoo et al. stated that nitric acid-treated AC increased the concentration of carboxylic groups onto its surface for the treatment. However, this treatment did not mark any strong effect on the adsorption rate of oligosaccharides (carbohydrate compounds) from aqueous solutions [72].2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is an herbicide that is used for the careful control of broadleaf weeds.

        <p>Number of possible routes has been put forward for designating the sources responsible for the enhancement of pharmaceutical pollution which includes incomplete metabolized and excreted drugs in the urine and feces, which enter into the water system. Other feasible source is the spare, or expired drugs, that may be dumped into toilets. Few drugs are not easily degradable and thus persist in the water system. Adverse effects of PPCPs include aquatic toxicity, genotoxicity, and endocrine disruption. Additionally, presence of trace amount of PPCPs in drinking water is also a public health concern, as little is known about probable chronic health issues related to long-term ingestion of mixtures of such compounds through drinking water. Table 5 presents the adsorption of various pharmaceutical and personal care products onto AC. Salman with his coworkers studied the removal of bentazon and carbofuran pesticides from aqueous solution. For this, they synthesized date seed-based AC with potassium hydroxide and carbon dioxide used as the activating agents [84]. Freundlich model for both pesticides fitted better to the adsorption equilibrium data as compared to Langmuir model. Maximum adsorption capacities as calculated from Langmuir isotherms were 86.26 and 137.04 mg/g for bentazon and carbofuran, respectively. Due to smaller size of carbofuran as compared to bentazon, it easily penetrated into the pores of AC thus offering high removal efficiency. Pesticide initial concentration was found to be the more influential factor as compared the solution pH. 4.4. Dyes. Dyes are the colorful compounds designed intentionally to give hue to fabrics and paper. These have the tendency of attaching to any responsive material. These have been utilized since the past many centuries. In the initial times, these were derived from the natural sources such as plants, insects, or microbes, but one major problem with these dyes was their short-term application part. Under the influence of sunlight and temperatures, these dyes faded away which led to the need for the emergence of synthetic dyes. Synthetic dyes are the laboratory-synthesized dyes first invented by WH Perkins in 1856 that solved the issue of per-sistency of dye color. Such synthetically produced dyes were structurally stable and difficult to degrade [94][95][96]. With their emergence, industries started utilizing them as their major product constituent and disposed them off into water system after use without any treatment process that raised serious environmental and health issues. Relative proportion of dye effluents added by various industries to the environment has been presented in Figure 5. Although it seems that resuming the usage of natural dyes are a better alternative, it was found to be more bad as employing synthetic dyes alone because in order to increase the bonding capability with the fabrics, a mordant is required. Mordants are basically binding agents that help in the attachment of natural dye to materials. These are much more toxic and dangerous than that of synthetic dyes.Number of possible routes has been put forward for designating the sources responsible for the enhancement of pharmaceutical pollution which includes incomplete metabolized and excreted drugs in the urine and feces, which enter into the water system.

        <p>Dye-utilizing industries purge dye effluents into the water sources without any treatment process. Water pollution due to dyes is objectionable to environmentalists due to their toxic and hazardous nature [100,101]. Addition of concentrated dye effluents to water bodies with acidic characteristics and high temperature disturbs the oxygen transfer mechanism and the self-purification ability of environmental water bodies. Mixing of water bodies with dye effluents also results into turbidity that forms a visible foam layer above the water surface due to which it blocks the penetration of sunlight into water system, thus limiting the requirement of sunlight by aquatic species for photosynthesis and respiration. Presence of dye effluents in the water bodies becomes a breeding ground for various microbes such as bacteria and fungi, and their presence in water makes it unsuitable for consumption. Recently, a law governing the level of presence of these effluents has been established by the International Dye Industry Wastewater Discharge Quality Standards according to which industries have to ensure the wastewater released into the water bodies [102][103][104]. Table 6 summarizes the removal of dyes by various ACbased absorbents. Adsorption of dyes onto AC is mainly influenced by the surface properties. It is an amphoteric material having ability to exhibit cationic as well as acidic characters. Its interaction with the dye molecules is mainly influenced by the solution pH that makes the surface to behave differently in different solution pH. In 2007, activated carbon prepared from groundnut shell by chemical treatment with ZnCl 2 was utilized for the adsorptive removal of malachite green from aqueous solution [125]. High surface area of 1200 m 2 /g favored the adsorption of malachite green onto it. Maximum adsorption capacity of 114 mg/g was calculated. In another work, cotton fiber was used as the carbon precursor, and ZnCl 2 was employed as the activating agent. As designed cotton fiber-activated carbon (CFAC) was utilized for the removal of methylene blue from aqueous solution, BET surface analysis determined the high surface area, 2060 m 2 /g of CFAC with maximum adsorption capacity of 597 mg/g.

Increase in industrialization has led to the increase in VOC emission into the Usually, these are present in higher concentration near petrochemical plants as compared to the suburban areas. Presence of VOCs in the environment leads to global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, and photochemical smog. In human beings, they cause skin irritation, liver damage, liver malfunctioning, and asthma. There has been a rapid increase in concentration of VOCs in the environment, such as, in China, the total amount of VOCs has increased from 1.15 in 1980 to 13.35 Tg in 2010 [137]. Number of techniques has been suggested in literature for VOC removal such as catalytic oxidation, photocatalytic oxidation, reverse osmosis, ion exchange condensation, thermal oxidation, biological treatments, and adsorption. Out of all, adsorption process is the simplest, efficient, and economical alternative to this since it offers high degree of operation stability, no toxic by-product formation, no additional treatment requirement, and cost effectiveness.

        <p>Overall activity and reactivity of any catalyst depends upon the chemical composition, surface area, and physical properties. Any active material or phase can be imprinted onto a suitable support to provide it high surface area and improve its mechanical strength. In addition, extremely dispersed active phase can be stabilized by depositing it into the micropores of support. A synergistic relation exists between the active phase and support that enhances its catalytic activity. It helps in preventing the agglomeration rate. Most important parameter during catalyst designing is the proper dispersion of active phase onto the support that is described as the ratio of number of surface atoms of active phase to the total number of atoms present. Number of materials can act as a support, and one among them is the AC that is extensively utilized due to nontoxic, cheap availability and easy synthetic routes. It acts as a sink for the produced electron-hole pairs and thus helps in lowering the recombination of e --h + pairs. However, their activity gets highly influenced by the presence of impurities, also called catalyst poison such as copper, zinc, and iron. Major advantage of AC as a catalyst support is the fact that its pore structure and internal surface both can be widely varied. It consists of small area of disordered graphitic structure elements. Their catalytic activity is determined by electron transfer from the edges of carbon sheets. Therefore, the presence and distribution of these active sites are important. The catalytic activity of the graphite structure can be changed by the presence of heteroatoms such as sulphur and nitrogen in the lattice. Its activity also got influenced by the presence of acid or base surface oxide complexes. Key features of AC as the support material include (a) high resistance to acidic or basic mediums; (b) designed pore size distribution for particular reactions; (c) minimized cost as compared to silica and alumina supports; and (d) stability at high temperatures.Overall activity and reactivity of any catalyst depends upon the chemical composition, surface area, and physical properties. Any active material or phase can be imprinted onto a suitable support to provide it high surface area and improve its mechanical strength. In addition, extremely dispersed active phase can be stabilized by depositing it into the micropores of support. A synergistic relation exists between the active phase and support that enhances its catalytic activity. It helps in preventing the agglomeration rate.

        <p>Activated carbon and its composites can be utilized as a catalyst or catalyst support for various chemical reactions such as hydrolysis, hydrogenation, esterification, and hydrogenation. The carbon catalyst having amorphous morphology and highly reactive groups such as -COOH, -OH, and -SO 3 H acts as an efficient catalyst for the hydrolysis of pure cellulose to glucose which was not possible with conventionally used catalysts such as Amberlyst-15, Nafion, and Hmordenite. The carbon catalyst enhanced the hydrolysis rate due to its low activation energy requirement. High catalyst performance is accredited to its tendency to adsorb 1,4-glucan [141]. Figure 7 shows the conversion of cellulose to glucose by hydrolysis.Activated carbon and its composites can be utilized as a catalyst or catalyst support for various chemical reactions such as hydrolysis, hydrogenation, esterification, and hydrogenation.

        <p>Activated carbon and its various derivatives have found to be used in food and pharmaceutical industries. AC utilized as acidulants found a prominent use in food and pharmaceutical industries as a pH regulator, chelating agents, and antioxidant synergist. AC as acidulants helps in decolorizing maleic acid and adipic acid prior to their conversion and crystallization. Sodium benzoate and sodium sorbate are used as preservatives in food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries. Granular AC helps in decolorizing and deodorizing them even in less than 1% dosage during manufacturing [146]. Due to high purity and performance, AC has also been found to be a proficient adsorbent during pharmaceutical processing applications that entail highly efficient filtration system. This safeguards soluble minerals with low acid content that lessens the adulteration of the final product with negligible impact on solution pH. Due to exclusive adsorptive properties and bio-origin endorse AC with antitoxin properties also, it quickly enables to lessen the effects of poisons or overconsumption of stimulants, through aid with digestion and sensitive alimentary conditions. In veterinary medicine field, AC is extensively employed as a feed additive. It functions as a curative agent the same way as in human medicine by adsorbing undesirable or potentially harmful substances from animal's gastrointestinal tract, making it an effective treatment for poisoning and diarrhea.Activated carbon and its various derivatives have found to be used in food and pharmaceutical industries.

        <p>Researchers have suggested the adsorption and sequestration of CO 2 from the point of its origin. A number of techniques have been put forward for CO 2 capturing such as membrane separation, cryogenic techniques, liquid solvent absorption, temperature adsorption, solid sorbents, and pressure adsorption [6,147]. Adsorption is categorized as the most effective one due to its ease of operation, cost effectiveness, and economic processing. CO 2 adsorption onto AC requires the presence of basic functionalities such as the nitrogencontaining functional groups on its surface that favor the maximum CO 2 capturing [148]. When the carbon materials are treated with ammonia at ambient temperatures, ammonia decomposes to form free radicals (-NH 2 , -NH, and atomic hydrogen and nitrogen). These generated free radicals attack the carbon surface to form nitrogen-containing functional groups [149]. CO 2 capturing can be successfully determined using various techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD).Researchers have suggested the adsorption and sequestration of CO 2 from the point of its origin.

        <p>8.1. Thermal Regeneration. This method involves the temperature treatment which is accomplished using fixed bed furnaces, fluidized bed furnaces, and rotary kilns. Under this, adsorbed gases such as carbon dioxide, partially oxidized contaminants, and particulate matter can be removed from the adsorbent surface. It includes gasification of organism pollutants, drying at 105 °C, and pyrolysis under inert atmosphere. However, due to the high-temperature conditions, the adsorption efficiency of adsorbent gets drastically affected. Although thermal regeneration is quite a simple regeneration method, it is an energy-and time-consuming way and also leads to significant amount of C loss. In addition, numerous hazardous by-products can also be produced during the implication of this method [160].8.1. Thermal Regeneration.

        <p>8.2. Chemical Regeneration. In this method, certain chemicals are used for the regeneration of adsorbent by desorbing the adsorbed molecules from the adsorbent surface. The proficiency of this method depends strongly on the type of contaminant present on or in the spent of AC. This method typically leads to zero carbon-attrition and helps in maintaining the actual adsorption capacities of AC. The affinity of adsorbed molecules with that of the acidic or alkaline reagents used determines the extent of regeneration. The efficiency of this type of regeneration therefore depends on the solubility and the reactivity of the adsorbents with the chemical reagents [161].8.2. Chemical Regeneration.

        <p>8.4. Bioregeneration. It makes the use of microbial agents for regenerating the adsorption capacity and surface activity of AC. Bioregeneration occurs when the organic contaminant species can be easily desorbed. The concentration gradient of the organic contaminants between the adsorbent and the bulk liquid aids the bioregeneration. This two-step process of desorption and biological removal of the adsorbed organics has been verified in a closed-loop recirculating batch system [163]. It has been found that biodegradation occurs due to the presence of concentration gradient of the pollutant as one moves from the carbon surface to the bulk solvent. There are many factors that crucially affects the biogeneration of AC such as carbon activation method used, porosity of AC, concentration gradient and carbon saturation, type of microorganism used, and concentration of biomass. Major target compounds for the adsorption bioregeneration are synthetic organic compounds, explosive-contaminated ground water, industrial wastewater, and residual disinfectants [164].8.4.

        <p>An overall review has been presented on the activated carbon. Chemical and physical approach treatments have been discussed in detail. These treatments influence the overall activity of activated carbon towards various pollutants. Data presented emphasize the need for the presence of basic functionalities on activated carbon surface for the adsorption and storage of carbon dioxide. Adsorption capacities of activated carbon depends upon the surface area, pore size and volume, surface functionalities, and mineral matter content. Different precursors can be used for the activated carbon synthesis such as fossil fuels, agricultural wastes, and lignocellulosic. Precursors of biobased origin offer economical and easy availability that serves as a potent alternative to activated carbon derived from fossil fuels. Due to its attractive properties, it serves as a potential applicant for the adsorption of heavy metals, dyes, pesticides, and pharmaceutical effluents. Activated carbon also helps in the storage of various gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen. Despite such high application fields, we think its applications can still further be explored in various other fields such as antimicrobial, photocatalysis, and hydrogen production.An overall review has been presented on the activated carbon.
