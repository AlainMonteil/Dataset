        <p>Extracellular electron transfer (EET) in microorganisms is prevalent in nature and has been utilized in functional bioelectrochemical systems. EET of Geobacter sulf urreducens has been extensively studied and has been revealed to be facilitated through c-type cytochromes, which mediate charge between the electrode and G. sulfurreducens in anodic mode. However, the EET pathway of cathodic conversion of fumarate to succinate is still under debate. Here, we apply a variety of analytical methods, including electrochemistry, UV-vis absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, and electron microscopy, to understand the involvement of cytochromes and other possible electron-mediating species in the switching between anodic and cathodic reaction modes. By switching the applied bias for a G. sulfurreducens biofilm coupled to investigating the quantity and function of cytochromes, as well as the emergence of Fecontaining particles on the cell membrane, we provide evidence of a diminished role of cytochromes in cathodic EET. This work sheds light on the mechanisms of G. sulfurreducens biofilm growth and suggests the possible existence of a nonheme, iron-involving EET process in cathodic mode.Extracellular electron transfer (EET) in microorganisms is prevalent in nature and has been utilized in functional bioelectrochemical systems.

        <p>Electroactive bacteria are ubiquitous in environments ranging from the soil and wastewater to deep-sea hydrothermal vents and the human digestive system. [1][2][3] At an applied level, electroactive microbes show promise in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), 4 microbial electrosynthesis of value-added chemicals, 5,6 and as components of semiartificial photosynthetic systems. [7][8][9] Despite knowledge of their existence for over a century, precise mechanisms of charge transfer between the electrode and bacteria are still not fully elucidated. 10,11 Geobacter sulf urreducens is a prototype electrogenic bacterium whose biofilms exhibit the highest current densities on electrodes to date with uses in MFCs. 12,13 Its growth and electrogenic behavior have been studied on a multitude of electrode surfaces at both a macroscopic and a single-cell level. 14,15 Oxidation of acetate to CO 2 is the model oxidation reaction investigated (anodic mode) (Figure 1a). Studies have postulated that its extracellular electron transfer (EET) proceeds through a pilus-and/or cytochrome-mediated pathway. 1,[16][17][18][19][20] Recent works have implicated the involvement of riboflavin as well. 21,22 Research efforts have also shown that, under certain conditions, G. sulf urreducens can produce reductive currents at a negatively biased electrode stemming from reactions such as the reduction of fumarate to succinate (cathodic mode). 23,24 The precise mechanisms underlying cathodic mode EET are even more ambiguous than those governing anodic mode EET. 25,26 Several studies have proposed cytochromes, hydrogenases, and solubilized redox mediators as being potential channels for electron transfer in this configuration, though conclusive answers are not universally agreed upon. 27 In this work, we carried out a multifaced study on the growth and electrogenesis of G. sulfurreducens in systematically switching between anodic and cathodic modes on inverse-opal indium tin oxide (IO-ITO) electrodes (Figure 1b). In addition to the conventional electrochemical experiments, we performed complementary studies using in situ resonance Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, quartzcrystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) measurements, and ex situ scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) to piece together clues behind the mechanisms of their anodic and cathodic electron transfer. Using this comprehensive set of measurements, we found that the anodic mode function is mainly linked to the biofilm's cytochrome expression, but the cathodic mode likely operates partially through an alternate channel. We propose that an Fecontaining soluble species that can either come from Fe ions in the medium or alternatively be scavenged from cytochromes is contributing to cathodic mode charge transfer under our set of reaction conditions. The presented findings add insight into G. sulfurreducens' function in its natural environments. At an applied level, they may also aid emerging biotechnologies.

        <p>G. sulf urreducens biofilms were grown on IO-ITO electrodes, which were prepared through a hard-template method from polystyrene microspheres and ∼20 nm ITO nanoparticles (see Experimental Details). [28][29][30] IO-ITO with a macropore size of ∼10 μm was chosen because of its high degree of meso-and macroporosity that both facilitates mass transfer from the solution and features a high degree of surface area in its electrically conductive macropores. 30,31 This allows for the electrodes to accommodate a high geometric density of biofilm growth by facilitating the effective penetration of G. sulf urreducens cells which are approximately 0.2 μm in diameter and 2 μm in length. [30][31][32] The structure also enables biofilm growth in such a manner that most cells are directly wired to the electrode. The secondary benefit of using an ITO substrate is that it is optically transparent, allowing for in situ spectroscopic experiments to be carried out. 11,19,33 To grow biofilms, IO-ITO electrodes were immersed in a G. sulf urreducens medium (featuring acetate to be oxidized by the bacteria) in oxygen-free conditions and poised at ∼0.3 V vs SHE for 4 days. 30 SEM images acquired after a typical initial growth in anodic mode show G. sulfurreducens cells attached to the IO-ITO surface (Figure 2a and2b).G. sulf urreducens biofilms were grown on IO-ITO electrodes, which were prepared through a hard-template method from polystyrene microspheres and ∼20 nm ITO nanoparticles (see Experimental Details).

        <p>We subsequently explored the use of this IO-ITO electrode modified with G. sulf urreducens for growth and switching between anodic and cathodic modes (Figure 3). The first anodic growth resulting in biofilm formation onto the electrode featured a commonly observed lag phase followed by an exponential growth period and finally a current plateau at ∼2 mA cm -2 . The lag phase has previously been postulated as a period of cell attachment to the electrode surface and extracellular matrix formation prior to reproduction resulting in the exponential phase. 30,34 The current plateau is known to result from a mature anodic biofilm.We subsequently explored the use of this IO-ITO electrode modified with G. sulf urreducens for growth and switching between anodic and cathodic modes (Figure 3).

        <p>In contrast, when switching to the cathodic medium with fumarate and an applied potential of -0.44 V vs SHE, currents rapidly decayed to ca. -0.15 mA cm -2 and thereafter remained constant (Figure 3a). No lag phase or exponential growth was noted. Switching back to anodic mode once again gave rise to a new cycle of lag phase, exponential growth, and current plateau. However, each anodic growth required more time to reach the current plateau. Despite this, the plateau was observed in each case at a similar current density as the first anodic growth. Assuming the biofilm is already existing at a mature level because it reached a current plateau in the previous anodic growth, the current-time kinetic trace in this case is suggested to stem from an additional process besides biofilm growth. Each cathodic step, on the other hand, Journal of the American Chemical Society exhibited similar current-time profiles with the exception of the very initial decay (Figure 3a). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) after the first anodic and cathodic mode growth taken under turnover conditions (i.e., in the presence of substrate) showed a typical sigmoidal shape with a half-wave potential centered at -0.14 V vs SHE for anodic (Figure 3b) and approximately -0.2 V for cathodic (Figure 3c) modes.In contrast, when switching to the cathodic medium with fumarate and an applied potential of -0.44 V vs SHE, currents rapidly decayed to ca. -0.15 mA cm -2 and thereafter remained constant (Figure 3a).

        <p>UV-vis absorption spectra of the biofilm grown in anodic mode on IO-ITO electrodes featured strong bands at 409 and 419 nm for the oxidized and reduced species, respectively, arising from the well-known Soret absorption of the heme units of the G. sulfurreducens cytochromes (Figure 3d). After switching to cathodic mode, the intensity of the Soret band with the maximum at λ = 409 nm (representing the oxidized cytochrome species) is significantly decreased. Returning back to anodic mode resulted in an increase once more of the Soret band intensities, and again, these decreased after switching to cathodic mode (Figure 3e). As the measured absorbance is proportional to the concentration of heme units, the measurements suggest that the total amount of cytochromes increases after every anodic mode cycle, whereas after each cathodic mode step the overall cytochrome amount seems to be decreasing. We believe the first lag phase to stem from a combination of bacteria attaching to the electrode, extracellular matrix formation, and cytochrome expression necessary for EET. Initially the cells are grown in a fumarate-containing medium. The change from a soluble electron acceptor (fumarate) to an insoluble electron acceptor (electrode) may lead to a lengthy adaptation time for the cells to perform electrode respiration. Cytochromes are partially depleted during the cathodic mode, which suggests that their build-up is linked to longer anodic mode lag phases in the 2 nd and 3 rd cycles.UV-vis absorption spectra of the biofilm grown in anodic mode on IO-ITO electrodes featured strong bands at 409 and 419 nm for the oxidized and reduced species, respectively, arising from the well-known Soret absorption of the heme units of the G. sulfurreducens cytochromes (Figure 3d).

        <p>QCM-D is emerging as a powerful tool to probe the interaction of biological materials with inorganic substrates. 33,[35][36][37][38] As a sample flows over and attaches to a piezoelectric quartz chip, the chip's resonance frequency and dissipation (rate of frequency decay) shift is proportional to the materials' mass. We used this technique to obtain a complementary set of mechanistic insights into G. sulfurreducens' growth behavior (Figure 4a). Biofilm growth was carried out directly in a QCM-D cell (Figure S2), which allowed us to monitor the biofilm's current-time profile and correlate to its mass increase (Figure 4b and4c). A planar quartz chip coated with a planar thin ITO film (commercially purchased) was used to resemble the standard growth conditions employed earlier on the IO-ITO electrode.QCM-D is emerging as a powerful tool to probe the interaction of biological materials with inorganic substrates. 33,[35][36][37][38] As a sample flows over and attaches to a piezoelectric quartz chip, the chip's resonance frequency and dissipation (rate of frequency decay) shift is proportional to the materials' mass.

        <p>To induce biofilm growth, the anodic growth medium was flown through the QCM-D cell and an aliquot of G. sulf urreducens injected once the time-dissipation trace exhibited stable behavior at ∼0.3 V vs SHE for &gt;12 h. The change in dissipation was used as a qualitative proxy for mass change rather than the change in frequency due to the thick, viscoelastic nature of the biofilm. 35,36 Because of the inherent characteristics of the film (thickness and composition), the QCM-D measurements here qualitatively illustrate trends rather than quantify precise mass changes.To induce biofilm growth, the anodic growth medium was flown through the QCM-D cell and an aliquot of G. sulf urreducens injected once the time-dissipation trace exhibited stable behavior at ∼0.3 V vs SHE for &gt;12 h.

        <p>We observed an immediate start of increase in dissipation following injection of the cells, whereas the current remained minimal for at least 12 h (Figure 4b). A part of this increase at the beginning can be rationalized by sedimentation and attachment of the cells to the electrode surface. However, the continual rise of dissipation for more than 12 h (circulation was stopped after 15 min) suggests that the initial stages of G. sulf urreducens biofilm growth proceed even without significant electron transfer to/from the electrode. This is contrary to the speculation that the lag phase consists of minimal biofilm growth and that biofilm growth is only initiated in the exponential growth phase. In agreement, previous QCM-D studies have found the first stages of initial bacterial attachment (sedimentation) plateaus within 1-2 h. [39][40][41][42] The dissipation slowed down after this initial increase and then began to rise again at ∼2-3 days. This time the current also began to rise exponentially after undergoing the previously mentioned lag phase (Figure 4c). Because this rise in current occurred after an initial biofilm was established, we speculate that the rise in current may be correlated to an enhanced expression of cytochromes within each bacterium cell for EET Journal of the American Chemical Society rather than only biofilm growth. Both the current and the dissipation kept rising, though with different profiles, until ∼7 days. A small decrease at 7 days stems from a piece of biofilm visibly detaching from the ITO electrode due to the medium circulation. Drops within the current-time trace between 4 and 6 days stem from restarting circulation, but overall the current-time profile is comparable to that of the growth on IO-ITO electrodes.We observed an immediate start of increase in dissipation following injection of the cells, whereas the current remained minimal for at least 12 h (Figure 4b).

        <p>After 7.5 days, a bacteria-free cathodic medium was circulated through the QCM-D cell and the electrode was Journal of the American Chemical Society switched to -0.44 V vs SHE. The current in cathodic mode was constant at -0.02 mA cm -2 and the mass remained unchanged. This provides a further level of insight into the anodic-cathodic switching behavior of the G. sulfurreducens biofilm: the cytochromes appear suppressed, while the biofilm mass largely remains when switching to cathodic mode.After 7.5 days, a bacteria-free cathodic medium was circulated through the QCM-D cell and the electrode was Journal of the American Chemical Society switched to -0.44 V vs SHE.

        <p>In situ resonance Raman (RR) spectroelectrochemistry was subsequently utilized to provide molecular level insights into the cytochrome characteristics. A 532 nm laser was used, which matches the Q-band absorption of the cytochromes in their reduced state (Figure 3d), significantly enhancing the resultant Raman signal. RR spectroelectrochemical experiments were carried out under nonturnover conditions, i.e., in fresh buffer medium that did not contain any substrate (acetate or fumarate). Shown are data from the biofilm grown on the planar QCM chip because of the higher signal intensities of the cell configuration. For reference, spectra of the biofilm grown on IO-ITO are shown in Figures S3 andS4. The RR spectra of G. sulfurreducens grown on ITO feature indicative bands at 1311 (ν 21 ), 1360 (ν 4,red ), 1495 (ν 3,red ), 1584 (ν 2 /ν 19,ox ), 1620 (ν 10,red ), and 1636 cm -1 (ν 10,ox ) (Figure 5a). The band frequencies are comparable to those observed in reported RR spectra for G. sulfurreducens and can be assigned to c-type cytochromes that dominate the RR spectra at this excitation wavelength. 43 Upon increasing the potential stepwise from -0.34 to 0.21 V (vs SHE), the relative intensities of the bands changed, although the band positions did not shift. Significant band shifts as usually observed for isolated cytochromes upon changing the heme redox state (i.e., ferrous to ferric) were not observed. Such a behavior has already been noted and attributed to the fact that RR monitors a variety of cytochromes in the biofilm in different (mixed) oxidation/ ligation states, which are present throughout the biofilm and react differently to the applied electrode potential. 44 In this respect, applying potentials affects only a part of the RR spectroscopically monitored cytochromes. This can be best visualized by the 1636 cm -1 band, which likely originates from the ν 10 mode of the oxidized heme in a six-coordinated lowspin state with a His-Fe-X axial ligation (X being a strong ligand), which is visible at -0.34 V (vs SHE), i.e., reducing conditions. Outer-membrane cytochromes have been reported to give rise to a strong mode at 1639-40 cm -1 resulting from a His/His axial heme ligation pattern, whereas cytochrome c with His/Met as axial ligands can be monitored around 1636 cm -1 . Upon stepwise oxidation, the band at 1636 cm -1 was accordingly found to increase in relative intensity, while bands at 1360 and 1495 cm -1 originating from the ferrous hemes diminished. This indicates an increase in the relative concentration of oxidized hemes with increasing the electrode potential.In situ resonance Raman (RR) spectroelectrochemistry was subsequently utilized to provide molecular level insights into the cytochrome characteristics.

        <p>To estimate the apparent redox potential, component fit analysis was performed. 45 In contrast to an excitation at the Soret band, using 532 nm yields less intense RR spectra of the heme units along with a significant selective enhancement of the ferrous over the ferric state. This complicates the spectral analysis to quantify the potential-dependent distribution of redox states. To extract quantitative information, an alternative approach was therefore employed. As it was not possible to obtain a "pure" redox state of a thick biofilm, i.e., fully oxidized and reduced hemes, the spectra at -0.34 and 0.21 V were fitted and treated as two separate spectral compounds (Table S1). In this way, the different redox equilibria present between -0.34 and 0.21 V (vs SHE) have been monitored and the recorded spectra fitted for the intermediate potentials.To estimate the apparent redox potential, component fit analysis was performed. 45 In contrast to an excitation at the Soret band, using 532 nm yields less intense RR spectra of the heme units along with a significant selective enhancement of the ferrous over the ferric state.

        <p>Examples of fitted spectra are shown in Figure S5a, and the resulting relative concentration as a function of potential is plotted in Figure S5b. Note that the intrinsic relative crosssection difference for ferric and ferrous hemes in the different ligation states was not considered in this approach. Nevertheless, the analysis procedure yielded an apparent redox potential at approximately -0.2 V vs SHE, matching the redox transition at the midpoint of the catalytic trace in the biofilm CVs under turnover conditions (Figure 5b and5c). This observation supports the change in the redox state of the cytochromes being related to the overall current flow via EET throughout the biofilm. 46,47 A similar behavior and no major spectral differences were noted for biofilms treated under cathodic conditions (Figures 5d, 5e, andS6). This indicates that under both anodic and cathodic conditions the redox state distribution (though not the overall quantity) of cytochromes is comparable. An additional band at 1624 cm -1 that seems to be more pronounced at oxidizing conditions could be observed, which has been also reported when ITO is employed as an electrode. 43,44 However, the 1624 cm -1 band may also arise from a ν 10 mode of the remaining reduced hemes at this potential that becomes more visible as other bands in the vicinity decline in relative intensity. Component fit analysis yields a redox potential at around -0.2 V (vs SHE) (Figure 5d), matching the catalytic trace under cathodic conditions (Figure 5e) as well as the transition found for biofilms grown under anodic potentials (Figure 5b). In both anodic and cathodic modes, the RR-derived redox potential matches the redox potential of the cytochrome determined from cyclic voltammetry experiments under nonturnover conditions (Figure 5c and5e). We observe a second peak in the cathodic mode CV under nonturnover conditions that is centered around -0.34 V vs SHE, which may represent another species involved in the EET process in cathodic mode. As we do not detect any other cytochromes in the RR spectra (Figures S7 andS8), this redox couple does likely not arise from a cytochrome. Furthermore, CVs of biofilms after anodic mode do not exhibit this peak. However, due to the low(er) RR sensitivity at 532 nm, the involvement of a cytochrome cannot be fully ruled out.Examples of fitted spectra are shown in Figure S5a, and the resulting relative concentration as a function of potential is plotted in Figure S5b. Note that the intrinsic relative crosssection difference for ferric and ferrous hemes in the different ligation states was not considered in this approach. Nevertheless, the analysis procedure yielded an apparent redox potential at approximately -0.2 V vs SHE, matching the redox transition at the midpoint of the catalytic trace in the biofilm CVs under turnover conditions (Figure 5b and5c). This observation supports the change in the redox state of the cytochromes being related to the overall current flow via EET throughout the biofilm. 46,47 A similar behavior and no major spectral differences were noted for biofilms treated under cathodic conditions (Figures 5d, 5e, andS6). This indicates that under both anodic and cathodic conditions the redox state distribution (though not the overall quantity) of cytochromes is comparable. An additional band at 1624 cm -1 that seems to be more pronounced at oxidizing conditions could be observed, which has been also reported when ITO is employed as an electrode. 43,44 However, the 1624 cm -1 band may also arise from a ν 10 mode of the remaining reduced hemes at this potential that becomes more visible as other bands in the vicinity decline in relative intensity.

        <p>In the presence of acetate, no major spectral differences could be spotted in the RR spectra (Figure S9). However, component fit analysis performed on RR spectra in the potential range from -0.44 to 0.21 V (vs SHE) showed that the potential-dependent spectral changes are less pronounced than in the absence of substrate (Figure S10; 16-40%). This corresponds to a smaller fraction of hemes within the biofilm changing their respective redox states following the poised electrode potential. This is in line with previous reports which detected a majority of reduced hemes also at oxidative potentials as they are functioning as electron relays in the catalytic process. 47 The RR experiments bring forth several key points. (i) The half-wave of the catalytic currents is centered with the midpoint of the cytochrome redox potential. This implies that the cytochromes are facilitating EET in both anodic and cathodic directions. However, because of the greatly diminished signals of the cytochromes following the cathodic mode steps, they are likely not as abundant in that situation. (ii) We do not detect any other type of cytochrome after the Journal of the American Chemical Society cathodic mode under our experimental conditions. This means that G. sulf urreducens does not express a significant amount of different cytochromes to facilitate its EET in cathodic mode. Furthermore, the second peak at -0.34 V in the CV after the cathodic mode likely does not correspond to a cytochrome as no spectral changes in the RR data were observed at this potential.In the presence of acetate, no major spectral differences could be spotted in the RR spectra (Figure S9).

        <p>After each cathodic step we noted a color change of the IO-ITO electrode, which became progressively darker red (Figure 6a). We also observed that the bacteria-free electrolyte solution turned dark brown-red after each cathodic step. Postanodic conditions did not change the electrode's color, and the bacteria-free solution turned light red as planktonic bacteria appeared in the solution over time. The UV-vis spectrum of the red-brown solution postcathodic step displayed almost no bands related to cytochromes but an additional absorption peak at ∼620 nm, which could stem from FeO x species in solution and/or on bacteria in solution (Figure S11). This iron species seems to be forming both in solution and throughout the biofilm under cathodic mode as the concentration of the Fe-containing cytochromes decreased. To investigate the possible formation of FeO x particles, we transferred some G. sulfurreducens from the biofilm electrode after the second cathodic step to a TEM grid and imaged the bacteria at high magnifications. We discovered that the surface region of the cells was decorated with a series of ∼2-4 nm crystalline particles (Figure 6b and6c). Lattice fringes of 2.51 and 2.15 Å were measured, which may correspond to the theoretical dspacings for the Fe 2 O 3 (002) and (112) planes, respectively. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) point analyses of this region exhibited peaks attributed to Fe and Cu (the latter from the Cu TEM grid; Figure 6d). The G. sulfurreducens prior to growth on the electrode did not exhibit any crystalline particles on the cells' outer membrane (Figure S12). With this observation, we believe that the color change of the electrode following the cathodic step stems from the formation of FeO x particles by G. sulf urreducens. However, we cannot unambiguously distinguish whether the FeO x particles were formed directly on the bacteria membrane or precipitated from solution following their formation.After each cathodic step we noted a color change of the IO-ITO electrode, which became progressively darker red (Figure 6a).

        <p>Biomineralization is present in a wide array of microorganisms and is now observed to be at play in these specific cathodic step conditions. 48 G. sulf urreducens have been shown to precipitate nanoparticles of Pd, 49 Au, 50 and Ag. 51 A wide array of Fe oxides can also form through biomineralization. 52 In the cathodic mode, lower amounts of cytochromes are used in comparison to the amount in anodic mode. As such, in the cathodic mode excess Fe(III) from the cytochromes may be reduced to Fe(II) as part of the bacterial metabolic process. This solubilized Fe(II) could, in a subsequent step, be oxidized back to solid Fe(III) on the cell membrane. The source of Fe for the FeO x particles we found could be the cytochromes, which may not be needed to the same extent and partially degrade under cathodic mode conditions or from the Fecontaining cathodic buffer medium. Given these observations, the cytochromes seem not to be as heavily involved in the EET process under cathodic conditions and we hypothesize that Fe may be involved in the cathodic EET process, possibly as a redox mediator.Biomineralization is present in a wide array of microorganisms and is now observed to be at play in these specific cathodic step conditions. 48 G. sulf urreducens have been shown to precipitate nanoparticles of Pd, 49 Au, 50 and Ag. 51 A wide array of Fe oxides can also form through biomineralization. 52 In the cathodic mode, lower amounts of cytochromes are used in comparison to the amount in anodic mode.

        <p>To ascertain the potential source of the Fe that gives rise to surface FeO x particles, we first grew the G. sulf urreducens biofilm on an IO-ITO electrode under standard conditions (note, Fe was necessary in the initial anodic medium to achieve biofilm growth) and then switched to cathodic mode but using an Fe-free cathodic buffer medium (Figure 7). We noted that instead of a slowly decreasing current, the cathodic currenttime trace showed a rapid decay and then an increase in the current magnitude. One possible explanation of this is that Fe species are involved in the cathodic EET process but need to Journal of the American Chemical Society be first extracted from the cytochromes acting as an Fe source. Adding 10 mM of 2,2′-bipyridine to the cathodic step solution resulted in a decrease in the current density as Fe species were perhaps steadily complexed by 2,2′-bipyridine and no longer available for the EET pathway of G. sulfurreducens (Figure 7). 53 Discrepancies in the current densities between the individual biofilms after 2 days likely stem from the natural biofilm variance.To ascertain the potential source of the Fe that gives rise to surface FeO x particles, we first grew the G. sulf urreducens biofilm on an IO-ITO electrode under standard conditions (note, Fe was necessary in the initial anodic medium to achieve biofilm growth) and then switched to cathodic mode but using an Fe-free cathodic buffer medium (Figure 7).

        <p>■ DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS Putting together the entirety of our data, we formulate a plausible mechanism behind our results. The first stage of biofilm growth consists of the cells attaching to the electrode and biofilm growth. Following initial growth (which is evidenced to occur immediately through QCM-D measurements), the exponential current increase in anodic mode is thought to be enabled by the expression of cytochromes, as previously established. 1,16,20 Upon switching to cathodic mode, the biofilm mass remains intact but the same quantity of cytochromes is not necessary; thus, some of them may degrade to release Fe species. These Fe species could act as redox mediators and/or are eventually released from the cells as a byproduct and "stored" in the form of FeO x nanoparticles on the cell membrane (Figure 8). Therefore, the Fe species are speculated to be involved in the cathodic EET process. This observation falls in line with previous gene-deletion studies on G. sulfurreducens that suggested that cytochromes were not as involved in cathodic mode EET as they were in anodic mode. 25 In situ infrared spectroelectrochemical studies of Geobacter soli biofilms also concluded that cathodic nitrate reduction proceeds through a different electron conduit than anodic acetate oxidation. 54 Furthermore, solubilized Fe species have been implicated in EET in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 biofilms. 55 In all, we probed mechanisms of EET between G. sulfurreducens and ITO electrodes using a host of techniques that were utilized on this system, such as in situ QCM-D and RR spectroelectrochemistry. While cytochrome expression is vital for anodic growth, we have found evidence that under cathodic conditions, the cytochromes partially degrade and their Fe is possibly utilized as a soluble redox species mediated in the EET process and the excess Fe precipitates in the form of FeO x nanoparticles on the G. sulf urreducens surface. As we believe that cytochromes may be the Fe source for FeO x particle formation, we can speculate that FeO x particle formation/depletion is reversible to some extent. It remains to be seen whether or not the FeO x particles participate in EET or are simply a byproduct and if G. sulfurreducens can function entirely without outer-membrane cytochromes in cathodic mode. Previous studies with Shewanella have found FeS particles that form on the cells' surface and that Fe 2 O 3 and FeOOH particles added to the growing biofilm can even function as a bridge that facilitates EET. 56,57 While switching back to anodic conditions with bacteria-free solutions is possible and similar current plateaus can be attained, the change in biofilm composition is reflected in the longer amount of time it takes to do so after every cathodic step. In all, advancing the forefront of cell-based bioelectrochemical systems through the implementation of new techniques and routes of analysis is important to both extract fundamental insights into natural systems and develop functional biotechnological platforms.■ DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS Putting together the entirety of our data, we formulate a plausible mechanism behind our results.
