        <p>Under inert conditions, to a solution of 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (1 eq, 10 g, 7.24×10 -2 mol) and 3,4-dihydropyran (1.2 eq, 7.3 g, 7.9 mL, 8.68×10 -2 mol) in 30 mL dichloromethane (DCM), pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (0.1 eq, 1.8 g, 7.16×10 -3 mol) was added dissolved in 5 mL of DCM.</p>
        <p>The reaction mixture was allowed to react for 2 h and quenched by the addition of aqueous NaHCO3.</p>
        <p>The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 50 mL) and then dried with MgSO4. The drying agent was filtered, and the solvent removed in vacuo. The product was then purified by flash column chromatography using a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane (5:95) to obtain the pure compound as a colourless oil with a yield of 65%. Data consistent with reported literature. 1 2-Alkoxy-4-(oxan-2-yloxy)benzaldehydes (S2)</p>
        <p>Scheme 3: Synthesis of the 2-alkoxy-4-(oxan-2-yloxy)benzaldehyde intermediates.</p>
        <p>A two-neck round bottom flask is charged with S1 (1 eq) and potassium carbonate (1.2 eq) under inert conditions. The solids were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) and the required 1-bromoalkane chain (1.2 eq) was injected. The quantities of reagents used in the reaction are listed in Table SI1. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 60 °C. After cooling, the reaction mixture was diluted with water, extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 50 mL) and then dried with MgSO4. The drying agent was filtered, and the solvent removed in vacuo to obtain the pure compound without further purification. To a solution of S2 (1 eq) in tetrahydrofuran/ethanol (1:1), solid pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (1.5 eq) was added. The quantities of reagents used in the reaction are listed in Table SI2. The reaction mixture was allowed to react at reflux overnight and then quenched by evaporation of the solvent to dryness. The reaction crude was dissolved in dichloromethane and washed with water and brine. The organic layer was dried with MgSO4, the drying agent was filtered, and the solvent removed in vacuo.</p>
        <p>The product was then purified by flash column chromatography using a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane (50:50). (3-Alkoxy-4-formylphenyl) 4-methoxybenzoates (S4)</p>
        <p>Scheme 5: Synthesis of the (3-alkoxy-4-formylphenyl) 4-methoxybenzoate intermediates.</p>
        <p>Under inert conditions, a mixture of the required S3 (1 eq) and 4-methoxybenzoic acid (1.5 eq) in dichloromethane (60 mL) was cooled with an ice bath. To this, dissolved 1-ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide , EDC, or N,N'-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, DCC, (1.5 eq) in 10 mL DCM was added and allowed to react at 0 °C for 30-40 min. A catalytic amount of solid 4dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was added to the solution and left to react overnight slowly warming up to room temperature. The quantities of reagents used in the reaction are listed in Table SI3. The reaction mixture was then quenched by the addition of distilled water (40 mL) and washed with water and brine. The organic layer was dried with MgSO4, the drying agent was filtered, and the solvent removed in vacuo. The product was then purified by hot recrystallization in ethanol. .20 (q, J = 6.9 Hz, 2H, -OCH2CH3), 3.88 (s, 3H, -OCH3), 1.39 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 3H, -OCH2CH3). 13</p>
        <p>Scheme 6: Synthesis of the 2-alkoxy-4-(4-methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoic acid intermediates.</p>
        <p>To a mixture of S4 (1 eq) and resorcinol (1.5 eq) in DMSO (30 mL), a solution of H2NaO4P.H2O (4 eq) and ClNaO2 (3.5 eq) in water was slowly added dropwise. The quantities of reagents used in the reaction are listed in Table SI4. The reaction mixture was allowed to react overnight and then diluted with water (150 mL). The pH was adjusted to 8 with NaHCO3 saturated and left for 1 h, then acidified with 1 M HCl solution to pH 4 until precipitation was observed. The precipitated solid was filtered and recrystallized in hot ethanol to obtain the pure product. Under inert conditions, a mixture of S5 (1.1 eq) and either 3-fluoro-4-nitrophenol (1 eq) or 4nitrophenol (1 eq) were dissolved in dry dichloromethane (10 mL). To this, N,N'dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (1.25 eq) in 2 mL DCM was added and allowed to react for 1h. A catalytic amount of solid 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was added to the solution and allowed to react overnight. The quantities of reagents used in the reaction are listed in Table SI5 and SI6. The reaction mixture was then quenched by filtration of the precipitated DCU and then purified by flash column chromatography with DCM:EtOAc (97:3). The product was then purified by hot recrystallization in ethanol.</p>
