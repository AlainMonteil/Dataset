        <p>Flavylium compounds are a well-known family of pigments because they are prevalent in the plant kingdom, contributing to colors over a wide range from shades of yellow-red to blue in fruits, flowers, leaves, and other plant parts. Flavylium compounds include a large variety of natural compound classes, namely, anthocyanins, 3deoxyanthocyanidins, auronidins, and their respective aglycones as well as anthocyaninderived pigments (e.g., pyranoanthocyanins, anthocyanin-flavan-3-ol dimers). During the past few decades, there has been increasing interest among chemists in synthesizing different flavylium compounds that mimic natural structures but with different substitution patterns that present a variety of spectroscopic characteristics in view of their applications in different industrial fields. This Review provides an overview of the chemistry of flavylium-based compounds, in particular, the synthetic and enzymatic approaches and mechanisms reported in the literature for obtaining different classes of pigments, their physical-chemical properties in relation to their pH-dependent equilibria network, and their chemical and enzymatic degradation. The development of flavylium-based systems is also described throughout this Review for emergent applications to explore some of the physical-chemical properties of the multistate of species generated by these compounds.</p>
        <p>Flavylium dyes constitute a large family of both natural and synthetic compounds that include different classes such as anthocyanins, 3-deoxyanthocyanidins, and auronidins together with their respective aglycones. Other flavylium compounds result from the reaction of these natural compounds in biological matrixes, such as the pyranoanthocyanins found in red wine. In addition, a wide variety of bioinspired synthetic flavylium compounds have been prepared and have been found to have great potential for some applications, for example, in photochromic systems.</p>
        <p>Anthocyanins are the most frequently studied flavylium dyes because they are the largest class of water-soluble compounds present in the plant kingdom and are responsible for a range of colors in plants, from orange-red to purple-blue hues. These types of natural pigments play an important role in plant reproduction because they attract pollinators and seed dispersers by presenting attractive colors. 1,2 In addition, anthocyanins protect plants from several biotic and abiotic stresses. 3,4 Anthocyanins may act as photoprotective agents by absorbing excess visible and UV light, preventing the formation of free radicals that may affect plant tissues by compromising photosynthesis. 5,6 Because of their recognized antioxidant properties, anthocyanins may also be important in maintaining the integrity of membranes in fruits and vegetables during the postharvest period, decelerating cell senescence. 7,8 In addition, the consumption of anthocyanin-rich foods has been associated with numerous beneficial health effects owing to the multiple biological properties of these compounds (e.g., antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties). [9][10][11][12][13] Regarding the technological applications of anthocyanins, novel physicochemical properties have been discovered and multiple applications have been explored and extended to different areas, such as their use as pH-freshness indicators for food intelligent packaging and as photosensitizers for dye-sensitive solar cells (DSSCs). [14][15][16] The first reported anthocyanin structure (cyanidin-3,5diglucoside) was isolated from the flower of Centaurea cyanus by Willstaẗter and Everest in 1913 17 and was later synthesized by Robinson and Todd in 1932. 18 Scheme 1 displays the general chemical structure and substituent groups of the main 3deoxyanthocyanidin and anthocyanin pigments.</p>
        <p>Since the discovery of the first anthocyanin, more than 700 related chemical structures have been identified in nature. 19,20 The number of new and more complex structures with different glycosylation and acylation patterns has increased owing to the development of more advanced and sensitive analytical techniques involving fractionation chromatography and structural identification (e.g., mass spectrometry and NMR). 21 Anthocyanins are glycosylated forms of anthocyanidins, normally occurring as 3-glycosides or 3,5-diglycosides (Scheme 1). Different types of monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, galactose, rhamnose, and arabinose) and disaccharides (e.g., rutinose, sambubiose, and sophorose) can be attached to the flavylium core, and these sugars can also be acylated with hydroxycinnamic acids (e.g., caffeic, coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic acids) or aliphatic acids (e.g., acetic, malic, oxalic, and succinic acids). 22 Auronidins are furanoflavylium dyes found in liverworts and considered the oldest class of flavylium pigments from plant evolution. 23 However, 3-deoxyanthocyanidins, which are considered the chemical ancestors of anthocyanins, are characterized by a lack of hydroxyl substituent at position C3 and can be found in mosses, ferns, and other plants such as corn and sorghum. 24 Due to their structural diversity, the existence of a multistate of species that includes purple and blue quinoidal bases, and their respective anionic forms, anthocyanins and 3deoxyanthocyanidins are responsible for a wide array of wonderful colors found in many flowers, leaves, fruits, vegetables, roots, and stems, ranging from yellow-orange to violet-blue (λ max ∼ 450-650 nm). However, the colors and chemical stability of anthocyanins and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins are strongly affected by different factors such as the pH, temperature, light, oxygen, and presence of other substances, including copigments and metal ions, carbohydrates, proteins, and sulfur dioxide. [25][26][27][28][29] Anthocyanins are weak polyprotic acids, and depending on their predominant form in solution they may act either as electrophilic (flavylium) or nucleophilic (hemiketal) species in a variety of reactions. Altogether, anthocyanins are responsible for the rich chemistry underlying the formation of the different anthocyanin derivatives that have been described in food matrixes, from monomers to more complex structures, adducts conjugated with other polyphenols, pyranoanthocyanins, etc. (Scheme 2). 19,[30][31][32] In nature, many plants have anthocyanin color-stabilizing mechanisms to maintain their red and blue colors. [33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40] These mechanisms include intermolecular and intramolecular copigmentation, [41][42][43] self-association, 44 and metal complexation, 39 which are usually driven by several noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, π-π stacking, and metal-ligand interactions and hydrophobic effects. Furthermore, the ability of flavylium dyes to engage in four chemical reactions in solution (acid-base, hydration, tautomerization, and cis-trans isomerization reactions) triggered by different external stimuli (light, pH, and temperature) has attracted attention because of their many technological applications, namely, in food, textiles, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, biomedicine, energy fields, and photochromic systems capable of functioning as models for optical memories, and even for mimicking some elementary properties of neurons. [45][46][47][48] This Review summarizes the synthetic strategies developed in recent years to obtain different classes of flavylium-based compounds, the kinetic and thermodynamic studies of the pHdependent multistate of species generated by flavylium cations, their photochemistry, and the awareness of the events that drive the flavylium compound degradation in solution or biological systems and provides outlooks for their potential applications. Understanding the particularity of the color of flavylium compounds is much more complex than the scientific community generally acknowledges, and this Review deals with this issue with caution. A holistic approach based on the literature that integrates all the multidisciplinary sciences behind the organic chemistry and physical chemistry of flavylium compounds is needed to fulfill the knowledge on this matter.</p>
        <p>In this section, the current synthetic and hemisynthetic approaches to anthocyanins and their related flavylium salts and the developments that have occurred since the first synthesis described by Bulow and Wagner, 49 which is still widely used today, are carefully reviewed. Furthermore, recent findings on the genetic engineering of genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes in plant cells and microorganisms to produce anthocyanins are addressed.</p>
        <p>Over the last century, interest in flavylium and similar compounds has increased within the scientific community, which aims to explore their magnificent chromatic and physicochemical properties. Several diverse classes of flavylium-type compounds have been synthesized using different approaches and have been discovered in many plants and plantbased foods. In the case of anthocyanins, some biotechnological approaches have been reported and are still currently being developed as alternatives to their extraction from natural sources or chemical synthesis methods, as anthocyanins can also be obtained from plant cell cultures or through microbial production. [50][51][52] Considering the different biotechnological approaches for producing anthocyanins on an industrial scale, the production rate will necessarily define their future economic viability.</p>
        <p>This section is intended to give an overview of the primary synthetic methods and the flavylium-related molecules that have been reported to date. Over the years, many other important achievements have been made regarding the chemical and physicochemical properties of flavylium compounds and derivatives, highlighting the extraordinary and fascinating nature of these compounds. Subjects such as the molecular and supramolecular structures of natural anthocyanin derivative pigments (e.g., blue flower pigments) and the copigmentation effect of these compounds have been covered by some reviews, including one by Yoshida et al. 39 and another more recently by Trouillas et al. 40 in this journal.</p>
        <p>2.1. Chemical Synthesis 2.1.1. C-Ring Cyclization. Before the discovery of natural anthocyanins in plants by Willstaẗter and Everest in 1913, the first flavylium-type pigment was obtained by synthesis through the reaction between aroylketones (β-diketones) and resorcinol (type A condensation). 49 Another route for synthesizing flavylium salts through C-ring cyclization was later discovered by Robinson and co-workers, [53][54][55][56] which resulted from the aldol condensation between 2-hydroxybenzaldehydes (e.g., phloroglucinaldehyde) and substituted acetophenones (type B condensation). Type A and type B condensations normally employ strong mineral acids, such as HCl (g), aqueous HPF 6 , H 2 SO 4 , and HBF 4 , in solvents, such as acetic acid, acetic anhydride, diethyl ether, and ethyl acetate (Scheme 3). [57][58][59][60][61][62] The type B reaction (Robinson's method) became the most widely method for obtaining flavylium salts because of the practical convenience of obtaining acetophenone and 2hydroxybenzaldehyde derivatives with different substituent patterns, including glycoside residues, to synthesize anthocyanins and, more recently, anthocyanin metabolites with in vivo occurrence [63][64][65][66][67][68][69] (Scheme 3). However, when a phloroglucinoltype derivative is used, the Robinson conditions give rise to a complex mixture of products that are difficult to purify, such as yellow-orange xanthylium pigments, and therefore, flavylium salts are isolated in low yields (5-20%). For that reason, this reaction has been tentatively improved over the years, and some</p>
        <p>The type A condensation was also described by Johnson and Melhuish in 1947 to occur between phloroglucinol and arylethynylketones in H 2 SO 4 /acetic acid and was later explored by Kueny-Stotz et al. using a HPF 6 aqueous solution in acetic acid to yield highly methoxylated and hydroxylated 3deoxyanthocyanidins in greater yields (82-99%). 73,74 Furthermore, De Freitas and co-workers also discovered that phloroglucinol-type structures could react with cinnamic aldehydes under hydroalcoholic acidic conditions, yielding 3deoxyanthocyanidins; however, this reaction gave poor yields (∼10%). [75][76][77] Other procedures reported to obtain flavylium pigments first involved the synthesis and isolation of chalcones (Scheme 4). Bianco and co-workers demonstrated that the Heck crosscoupling approach between α,β-unsaturated ketone and an aryliodide could be used to obtain 2-hydroxychalcones in high yields (87%). Because of the presence of a hydroxyl group at carbon 2, the corresponding flavylium cation could be obtained easily, just by acidifying the solution through a mechanism described in Scheme 4. 78,79 Chalcones could also be obtained through the base-catalyzed aldol condensation between aldehydes and acetophenones. In the absence of the hydroxyl group at carbon 2 of the benzaldehyde derivative, chalcones need to react with phloroglucinol under acidic conditions and in the presence of an oxidizing agent, such as chloranil, yielding 4-substituted 3deoxyanthocyanidins (Scheme 4). 80 2.1.2. Grignard Reaction. The first studies reporting on the synthesis of a 3-deoxyanthocyanidin or an anthocyanidin through this method consisted of the addition of phenyl Grignard reagent to 3-methoxy-coumarin or coumarin itself, respectively. 81,82 In 2001, Roehri-Stoeckel et al. described the synthesis of 4-substituted flavylium dyes with 64 to 99% yields from the reaction of flavones with Grignard reagents in THF followed by neutralization with HCl or NH 4 Cl (Scheme 5). 83 2.1.3. Reductive Transformations of 4-Oxo-flavonoids. Interestingly, since the early 20th century, it has been possible to obtain anthocyanins and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins through reductive transformations of 4-oxo-flavonoids with different degrees of C-ring oxidation, namely, flavones, flavanones and 2-hydroxychalcones (Scheme 6). 84 Depending on the substituent groups of the flavone or flavonol (3hydroxyflavone) precursor and the selected conditions, the synthesis yield of anthocyanins and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins ranges from 10 to 95%.</p>
        <p>These reductive transformations involve the following: (A) Clemmensen-type reduction under metal/acid conditions was investigated by a few groups in the early 20th century 85,86 and later by King and White; 87 however, the yields were low (less than 20%). The conversion of flavonol glycosides into anthocyanins was reported by Elhabiri et al., using Zn-Hg in 3% absolute methanolic hydrochloric acid with yields of 52-60%. 88 Nevertheless, Yoshida et al. 89 re-examined the rutin reduction under the Elhabiri conditions with zinc amalgam, zinc powder, or magnesium powder and always obtained cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside in less than 30% yield under the optimized conditions 89 . The difference in yield could be due to the value of the molar absorption coefficients for cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside reported by Elhabiri et 89 Other groups applied this reaction to obtain anthocyanins and 3deoxyanthocyanidins from different starting flavone and flavonol glycosides, but the yields varied between 10 and 32%. 90,91 (B) NaBH 4 reduction and a subsequent oxidation using chloranil for flavanones and benzoquinone for 2-hydroxychalcones. Clark-Lewis and Skingle introduced reductive cyclization of 2-hydroxychalcones using NaBH 4 , giving flavenes in 60-80% yields, and then the dehydrogenation step proceeded with benzoquinone in acidic conditions to form flavylium com-pounds. 92 Sweeny and Iacobucci reported the formation of flavene intermediates from flavanone reduction using NaBH 4 . The dehydration step requires an oxygen substituent at C7, suggesting the involvement of a quinone methide in flavene formation. The oxidation of flavenes with a chloranil reagent under acidic conditions then gives rise to the formation of the flavylium. 93,94 (C) LiAlH 4 in the presence or absence of oxidizing agents. In 1950, Mirza and Robinson reported the use of LiAlH 4 reagent for the conversion of flavonols into anthocyanidins. 95 Afterward, Waiss and Jurd reported the synthesis of methylated cyanidin by a two-step reaction by using LiAlH 4 to reduce methylated quercetin to flavene intermediates and then introducing benzoquinone in acetic acid for flavene oxidation, giving yields of up to 80%. 96,97 In 2017, Kimura and co-workers reported using the same method to transform 8-aryl-methylated quercetins into the corresponding methylated cyanidins with 41-70% yields and without the need for any oxidizing agent. 98,99 2.1.4. From Flavanol to Flavylium. In 2006, Oyama, Kondo, and co-workers reported a new and interesting synthesis protocol for obtaining anthocyanins from flavan-3-ols as a starting material. The first step consisted of the glucosylation of the C3 hydroxyl group in 3′,4′,5,7-tetrabenzyl-O-(+)-catechin with tetraacetylglucosyl imidate, yielding 3-β-tetracetylglucosyl-O-(+)-catechin tetrabenzylate. Following debenzylation and silylation, the molecule was oxidized with 2,3-dichloro-5,6dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) and dehydrated to give a flav-3-en-3-ol. Further deprotection of the acetyl groups and oxidation under air in HCl-MeOH solution yielded cyanidin-3-glucoside, with a 51% yield (Scheme 7). 100 The mild air oxidative conversion of a flavene to flavylium revealed good yields and overcame the need to use oxidizing agents such as chloranil and benzoquinone reported for metal-reductive transformations.</p>
        <p>2.1.5. Synthesis of Anthocyanin Derivatives. In the 20th century, the scientific community became aware of the high reactivity and instability of flavylium compounds, especially natural anthocyanins, which can easily be transformed into novel derivatives in food matrixes. In 1996, Cameira dos Santos et al. 101 detected a new family of anthocyanin derivatives in red wine filtrate samples. These pigments revealed a hypsochromic shift of their λ max compared to anthocyanins (λ max 507 nm), which have a more brick-orange color at acidic pH values. The structures of these pigments were further elucidated by Fulcrand et al., 102 who revealed a new pyranic ring D between C4 and the hydroxyl group at C5 of anthocyanin and a hydroxylphenyl group that was connected at position 10 (Figure 1a). In 1997, Bakker and Timberlake 103 described the formation of a new pyranoanthocyanin (vitisin A); however, only one year later, the correct structure was elucidated by Fulcrand et al. 104 Since then, several classes of this type of anthocyanin derivative have been identified in different food matrixes and chemically synthesized in model solutions, and their respective formation mechanisms have been described. Although pyranoflavylium-type structures were first isolated from the resin of dragon's blood trees 105 and were also identified in other plants, such as in petals from Rosa hybrida and blackcurrant seeds, [106][107][108] the primary occurrence of pyranoanthocyanins has been described in beverages such as fruit and vegetable juices and red wines. 109 In red wines, the presence of this type of anthocyanin derivative contributes to changes in their organoleptic properties, namely, in the appearance of orange hues observed in aged red wines. The primary pyranoanthocyanins present in red wine are formed from the reactions of anthocyanins with yeast metabolites, which are released into the must during the fermentation process, for example, pyruvic acid, 103,104 acetoacetic acid, 110 acetone, 111 and acetaldehyde. 103 More complex classes of pyranoanthocyanins arise from the reaction between anthocyanins and cinnamic acids or vinylphenols (pinotins) [112][113][114] and between anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols (catechins and procyanidins) in the presence of acetaldehyde [115][116][117][118][119] (Figure 1b).</p>
        <p>The formation pathway results from an annelation in which a nucleophilic enol derived from a carbonyl compound (R 2 = OH, Scheme 8) or a vinyl group (R 2 = H, Scheme 8) attacks the electrophilic C4 of the starting flavylium C-ring and then the phenolic OH at C5 adds to the carbonyl group, giving a hemiketal. Following H 2 O elimination and some oxidation steps, a new pyrano D-ring is yielded, and for that reason these compounds were named pyranoanthocyanins (Scheme 8).</p>
        <p>The formation mechanism of more complex pyranoanthocyanins such as pyranoanthocyanin-flavan-3-ol pigments involves the participation of 8-vinylflavan-3-ols as intermediates. [120][121][122] It has been postulated that these intermediates result from the preferential nucleophilic attack of the carbon 8 of the phloroglucinol A-ring of the acetaldehyde carbocation, which is formed after the protonation of the carbonyl group and further water elimination. 123 The vinyl bond of 8-vinylflavan-3ol will attack the electrophilic C4 position of the anthocyanin, yielding a stabilized quinone methide. After some oxidation steps, the pyranoanthocyanin-flavan-3-ol pigments are obtained (Scheme 9).</p>
        <p>Once 8-vinylflavan-3-ol was found to be an important intermediate in the formation mechanism of pyranoanthocyanin-flavan-3-ols, the synthesis of vitisin B was reported from the reaction between anthocyanins and commercially available vinyloxytrimethylsilane under hydroalcoholic conditions at acidic pH values. 124 Vitisin B-type pigments are very difficult to isolate directly from food matrixes because of their very low concentrations. Thus, from this reaction, it was possible to obtain this type of pyranoanthocyanin with a yield up to 30%, which allowed for the study of some of the physical-chemical properties of this type of pigments. A few years later, a second generation of more complex pyranoanthocyanins started to emerge as a result of the chemical transformations of carboxypyranoanthocyanins into new derivatives (Scheme 9). Carboxypyranoanthocyanins (vitisin A) can react with water, yielding pyranone anthocyanin derivatives (oxovitisins) that possess a yellowish color (λ max 373 nm) at pH 2. The suggested formation mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack on water at the electropositive C10 of carboxypyranoanthocyanins, yielding a hemiketal that further undergoes decarboxylation, giving a new neutral pyranone structure (Scheme 9). 125 Carboxypyranoanthocyanins also demonstrated the ability to react with flavan-3-ols in the presence of acetaldehyde, giving rise to a new family of anthocyanin-derived pigments, vinylpyranoanthocyanin-flavan-3-ols, known as portisin-type A, because the first identified pigment was isolated from a young Port wine (Scheme 9). [126][127][128] These pigments have a purplebluish color at acidic pH values (λ max 570 nm), which is due to the extended conjugation of π electrons. Later, other portisintype B pigments were detected in aged Port wines that resulted from the reaction between carboxypyranoanthocyanins and cinnamic acids (or vinylphenols resulting from microbial decarboxylation); however, these pigments have a λ max hypsochromically shifted (between 533 and 540 nm in aqueous solution at pH 1 when compared to the portisin-type A pigments. 129 The formation of portisin-type pigments results from a nucleophilic attack on the vinyl group of the 8vinylflavan-3-ol intermediate or through an attack of the double bond of cinnamic acids on the electropositive C10 of the pyranic ring. The last steps normally involve the loss of a formic acid, decarboxylation, and oxidation, giving rise to the final pyranoflavylium structure and then to the final vinylpyranoflavylium structure. 130 Moreover, new families of pigments with outstanding chromatic features were found to occur in aged Port red wines and in their respective sediments (lees). The reaction between carboxypyranoanthocyanins and 10-methylpyranoanthocyanins (or 10-ethylpyranoanthocyanins) resulted in the formation of pyranoanthocyanin dimers, which present an unusual and attractive turquoise blue color under acidic conditions (λ max 680-730 nm). 131 The high delocalization of the π electrons across the two pyranoanthocyanin moieties promotes a large red shift in its maximum wavelength. Two synthetic pathways were initially proposed for the formation of dimeric pigments. The first suggested the deprotonation of the methyl group on the methylpyranoanthocyanin with the formation of a methylene group at carbon C10, followed by the double bond attack to the electrophilic carbon C10 of the carboxypyranoanthocyanin molecule. The deprotonation of the methyl group is more favorable to occur at a basic pH (pH ∼ 11); however, at the typical pH of food matrixes, the proton loss could occur to yield trace amounts of a very efficient nucleophile. 132 In the second hypothesis, it seems that charge transfer might be responsible for initiating the condensation between these two entities. This complex is stabilized by the π-π interactions of the aromatic rings, and dipole-dipole interactions would place both partners in the right orientation for reaction. This formation pathway was initially proposed by Chassaing et al.; 133 however, the way this charge-transfer complex evolves remains unknown. It is proposed that further condensation between both precursors might occur through an ionic or radical reaction. The last step involves the loss of a formic acid molecule, leading to the formation of a structure with two pyranoanthocyanin moieties linked through a methine group. In 2001, Roehri-Stoeckel et al. reported that the synthesis of new 4-substituted flavylium salts could result from reactions between 4-methylflavylium pigments and 4-N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and 4-N,N-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde reagents in methanol under reflux. The resulting pigments showed a large bathochromic shift, providing intense blue-violet to green colors (λ max 548-730 nm, in methanol with 5% 0.1 M HCl) (Scheme 10). 83 Interestingly, the same authors also verified that, for 4-methylflavylium salts with R 1 = OH (4methyl-5-hydroxy-3-deoxyanthocyanidins), a pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidin structure formed as a result of the intramolecular cyclization promoted by a hydroxyl nucleophilic attack, as described previously in the pyranoanthocyanin formation mechanism (Scheme 8). Based on those conclusions, Chassaing and co-workers later reported the synthesis of pyranoflavylium pigments through the reaction of 4-methyl-5,7-dihydroxyflavylium hexafluorophosphate salts and electron-rich aromatic aldehydes in refluxing ethanol. These authors indicated that this reaction was unlikely to occur when using aromatic aldehydes with electron-withdrawing substituents, such as fluor, cyano and nitro groups. The formation of a chargetransfer complex seems to be the responsible for initiating the condensation between aromatic aldehydes with electrondonating groups and 4-methylflavylium salts. 133,134 Later, da Silva et al. extended the scope of this reaction to aromatic aldehydes, including those with electron-withdrawing substituents or an attached heterocyclic or polycyclic aromatic ring. Three modifications were employed in the procedure by Chassaing and co-workers, namely, by using excess aromatic aldehydes under an inert atmosphere during the first hours and the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as an acid catalyst to support the formation of the corresponding products at good yields (64-89%). 135 Oliveira and co-workers also noted that 10methylpyranoanthocyanins had the capacity to react with cinnamic aldehydes (e.g., sinapaldehyde, 4-(diethylamino)cinnamaldehyde, and 4-(dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde), resulting in a family of pyranoanthocyanin-based bluish pigments with two conjugated vinyl groups (butadienylidene group) presenting a λ max value from 538 to 568 nm under acidic conditions, and the proposed mechanism involves a chargetransfer reaction pathway proposed by Chassing et al., 133 and similar to the formation of pyranoanthocyanin dimers described before. 136,137 However, the pigments that were expected to present a higher maximum absorption wavelength because of the higher π delocalization unexpectedly showed a marked hypsochromic shift compared to their amino-based portisin counterparts (638 nm). 138 With inspiration from the formation of natural pyranoanthocyanins through annelation reactions, other synthetic pyrano-3deoxyanthocyanidin pigments have recently been synthesized through the reaction of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins and different molecules (e.g., pyruvic acid, acetone, cinnamic acids, and styrylmethylketones), yielding a portfolio of colored compounds (λ max 439-556 nm, under aqueous acidic conditions). Due to the extra pyranic ring, some pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidin derivatives could have interesting symmetries resulting from the positive charged distribution between the two pyranic rings and depending on the substituents in their structures (Scheme 11). 24,60,139,140 The chemistry of other families of anthocyanin derivatives that primarily occurs in grapes and their relevance in red wines have been frequently reviewed. 141 They can be divided in two groups when considering their formation pathways: nucleophilic addition of a C-centered nucleophile (anthocyanin hemiketal form) to the C4 position of the flavylium cation and aldehydemediated electrophilic substitutions. Some of them have also been synthesized under model winelike conditions. The presence of oligomeric anthocyanins (dimers and trimers) was first detected in grape skins using mass spectrometry techniques, and their structures present a flavylium cation as a terminal unit linked to a flavan or flavene form as extension units through A-type (C4-C6 and C2-O-C7 or C4-C8 and C2-O-C5) or B-type (C4-C6 or C4-C8) linkages, respectively [142][143][144][145].</p>
        <p>A few years later, Oliveira et al. detected the occurrence of Atype anthocyanin (malvidin-3-glucoside derivative) dimers and trimers in grape skins and in a young Port wine using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. 146 These authors suggested that the presence of a flavene structure is not likely to occur because of the nucleophilic attack of the OH group in the C7 position to the unsaturated C2 of the flavene moiety. A-type anthocyanin trimers can present four isomers, (α,α), (α,β), (β,α), and (β,β), because the pyranic rings composed by C7-O-C2 (formed between D-and C-rings and between G-and F-rings) may be above (α) or below (β) the plane of the structure. Theoretical and computational studies suggest that the A-type malvidin-3-glucoside trimer isomer (α,β) is the most stable.</p>
        <p>Another example of direct condensations is the reaction between anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols that can yield colorless bicyclic A-(O)-F 147,148 and colored F-A +149 dimeric pigments (Scheme 13). The formation of F-A + in wines is well established in the literature and is described in two steps: first, a cleavage of the interflavanolic linkage of flavan-3-ols occurs, yielding a carbocation in C4, which then undergoes a nucleophilic attack of anthocyanins in their hemiketal form. Then, the formation of an A-(O)-F dimer results from the nucleophilic attack of the C6 or . 150 One of the first families of anthocyanin derivatives detected in red wines arose from the reaction of anthocyanins with flavan-3ols induced by acetaldehyde. 122,[151][152][153][154][155] Since the first adduct were described, the scientific community has identified and synthesized several new A + -(alkyl/aryl)methine-F-type adducts 145,[156][157][158][159]. In accordance with their formation pathway, the aldehydes in acidic media are protonated and then undergo a nucleophilic attack from the C8/C6 of flavan-3-ols. A dehydration then occurs, yielding another carbocation, which undergoes an attack from the C6/ C8 of the hemiketal of the anthocyanin. After a final dehydration, the new adduct is formed. 151 More recently, a group of anthocyanin-ellagitannin adducts were proposed by Quideau and co-workers to occur during red wine maturation due to the reaction of anthocyanins and Cglucosidic ellagitannins present in oak wood. Their mechanistic pathway is described by the nucleophilic attack of the anthocyanin hemiketal species on the C1 carbocation of (-)-vescalagin formed after the protonation/dehydration steps (Scheme 15). [160][161][162] They present a modest bathochromic shift in the visible band compared with that of anthocyanin (1, λ max 545 nm; 2, λ max 542 nm in HCl 0.1 M, pH 1), which can arise either from stronger intramolecular interactions between their flavylium and (-)-vescalagin aromatic moieties or from a charge-transfer contribution. 163,164 These pigments can make a significant contribution to the color change from red to more purple hues during the early stages of wine aging in oak barrels.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, anthocyanins are obtained directly from flowers, vegetables, and fruits. However, anthocyanins from plants are present as heterogeneous chemical structures, and plant extracts are rich in many other chemical compounds that could be a bottleneck for industrial purposes. In fact, the presence of other compounds affects the color performance of anthocyanins and their stability. However, purification of anthocyanins from complex plant extracts is often a very difficult, time-consuming, and expensive task. In addition, the anthocyanin contents of plants vary depending on the source and also on seasonal and environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>The limited commercial availability and the diversity of anthocyanins have led to searches for alternative sources. Chemical synthesis could be an option, as described in section 2.1. Another alternative is genetic engineering of genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes in plant cells and microorganisms such as bacteria (Escherichia coli) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for their use as cell factories for anthocyanin synthesis. 50,52,165 In plants, the high-level production of secondary metabolites can be achieved by engineering regulatory genes as well as genes encoding specific biosynthetic enzymes. The biosynthesis of anthocyanins in plants is well established. 166,167 These compounds are synthesized via the general flavonoid pathway, and they involve the condensation of malonyl-CoA and 4coumaroyl-CoA derived from phenylalanine or tyrosine as mediated by two key enzymes, chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone isomerase (CHI), to form naringenin chalcone and its isomer naringenin (a flavanone), respectively (Scheme 16). The latter compound is the primary intermediary in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins with many different decorations. Naringenin is modified through hydroxylation by enzymes such as flavanone 3β-hydroxylase (FHT syn. F3H), flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H) and flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (F3′5'H), giving rise to different dihydroflavonols (dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquercetin, and dihydromyricetin). Then, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) promotes the formation of leucoanthocyanidins (leucopelargonidin, leucocyanidin, and leucodelphinidin), and There are some clear examples in the literature of the production of anthocyanins from mutant plant cell lines that showed not only increased concentrations of anthocyanins but also changes in their decoration level and structural complexity. In a very interesting and inspiring study, Appelhagen et al. described the development of suspension cultures from tobacco plants that constitutively expressed the MYB Rosea1 (AmRos1) and bHLH Delila (AmDel) transcription factors (TF) from Antirrhinum majus to produce a higher level of anthocyanins. 50 These cultures produce exceptionally high amounts of anthocyanins (20-25 mg cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside equivalents/dry weight), 2-10 times higher than those that could be obtained from fruits, depending on the variety. Furthermore, the authors expanded the variety of anthocyanins produced using the same cell line through the coexpression of additional genes encoding F3′5′H from Petunia hybrida to obtain delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside or a gene encoding an anthocyanin 3-O-rutinoside-4‴-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase from Solanum lycopersicum (Sl3AT) to obtain the respective coumaroryl or feruloyl derivatives. That engineering strategy could be transferred to other plants with higher levels of decoration to obtain more complex anthocyanin structures. In fact, in the same study, Appelhagen et al. generated cell cultures from Arabidopsis thaliana expressing the same TF AmRos1 and AmDel, and their aim was to produce anthocyanins with multiple acyl groups 50 Other groups reported the production of 13 C and 14 C-labeled flavonoid compounds (including anthocyanins) from plant cell suspension cultures to follow their bioavailability in humans. 168,169 13 C-Labeled anthocyanins were obtained by [1-13 C]-L-phenylalanine feeding experiments where it will enter in plant secondary metabolism resulting into incorporation into anthocyanins through the shikimate pathway. In the case of 14 C-labeled anthocyanins, these were obtained by using uniformly labeled [ 14 C] sucrose as the source of label delivered to the metabolizing cell cultures.</p>
        <p>Another alternative way to produce anthocyanins is the genetic transformation of microorganisms, such as yeast and bacteria. The microbial biosynthesis approach to producing natural flavonoids dates back to 2003. 52,170 This technique starts at the selection of the proper enzymes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways from different plant sources. Then, further modifications are required to obtain the desired functional expression. Microbes require the expression of at least 11 transgenes to introduce the complete anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway for de novo production of metabolites starting from glucose, which complicates the process. This approach can be simplified if natural precursors of anthocyanins (eriodictyol and naringenin) are supplied in the medium. However, since these precursors are too expensive, these strategies are not economically viable and it is advisible to use 4-coumaric acid as a starting point.</p>
        <p>However, the bacterial expression of genes encoding F3′H and F3′5′H is a bottleneck. expressed the genes F3H and ANS from Malus domestica, DFR from Anthurium andraeanum, and flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (F3GT) from Petunia hybrida in E. coli, and after optimization of the supplied UDP-glucose the bacterium produced 350 mgL -1 cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and 113 mgL -1 pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside by using eriodictyol and naringenin as precursors, respectively. 171 Unlike in plant cells, in which anthocyanins are moved from the cytoplasm to the vacuole and stored, microbial hosts lack the machinery for anthocyanin transport and stabilization. The intracellular pH of bacteria commonly used for metabolic engineering is approximately pH 7, and at this pH anthocyanins begin to suffer degradation. To stabilize anthocyanins, a twostep biocatalysis has been proposed, and after a specific growth stage during the metabolic process at pH 7 the cells should be transferred to fresh medium in which the pH is adjusted to 5 to minimize anthocyanin degradation. 172 More recently, specific anthocyanin biosynthetic genes recruited from A. thaliana and Gerbera hybrida were introduced into a S. cerevisiae strain expressing PAL, TAL, C4H, CPR, 4CL, CHS, CHI, F3H, DFR, ANS and 3GT. 51 In this microbial model, pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside was formed directly from glucose and located inside yeast cells, albeit at low concentrations. During the same year, Eichenberger et al. reported the reconstruction of the complete machinery for biosynthesizing P3G-, C3G-, and D3G-expressing enzymes from different plant sources within S. cerevisiae. 173 However, the resulting concentrations are low (P3G, 0.85 mg/L; C3G, 1.55 mg/L; and D3G 1.85 mg/L), and one of the limiting steps seems to be the activity of ANS, which has shown a strong ability to convert leucoanthocyanins into flavonol, bypassing the synthesis of anthocyanins. Interestingly, Zhang et al. reported that ANS extracted from Vitis vinifera (VvANS) catalyzes the in vitro transformation of natural leucocyanidin into flavan-3,3,4-triols and quercetin, suggesting that anthocyanidin synthase requires other substrates for the in vivo formation of anthocyanidins. 174 From another perspective, other biotechnological tools can be used toward the modulation of the acylation pattern of anthocyanins. A recent example is the production of a specific and highly selective catalytic diacylation enzyme by genetic engineering using E. coli codon-optimized gene encoding enzymes. This enzyme was shown to selectively remove acyl groups bound to Glc-1 of the 3-sophorose moiety of a cyanidin derivative from red cabbage while leaving the acyl group on Glc-2 intact, converting polyacylated anthocyanins into a monoacylated anthocyanin having a blue color at pH 7 (λ max of 640 nm). 175 In conclusion, replicating the plant anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in microorganisms such as E. coli or S. cerevisiae is a challenging task that is intended to respond to the growing industrial need for these natural pigments. Considering the different biotechnological approaches to produce anthocyanins at the industrial scale, the production rate will necessarily define their future economic viability.</p>
        <p>However, industrial applications of plant cell cultures for secondary metabolite production, including anthocyanins, are still rare, mostly as a result of the limited stability of long-term cultures, variable product yields, and high costs.</p>
        <p>From other perspectives, engineered anthocyanin biosynthesis has also been used to enrich these pigments in fruits, legumes, and cereals to improve their sensorial and nutritional quality. In the literature, some studies have described the production of anthocyanin-enriched fruits and cereals, such as purple tomatoes and purple endosperm rice. 176,177</p>
        <p>BY FLAVYLIUM CATIONS: THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC ASPECTS Anthocyanins are generally identified in the literature by their respective flavylium cations. 19 The systematic attribution of the identity of anthocyanins to their flavylium form without considering the pH conditions at which the experiments are performed could lead to misinterpretations of experimental results. In fact, the flavylium cation is a molecule (generally observed in very acidic solutions) of a complex system that includes other species that are reversibly interconnected by external stimuli such as pH, light and temperature.</p>
        <p>The history of anthocyanins and related compounds evolution up to the present perception of this system was previously described. 178 Under acidic to moderately acidic pH values, five chemical species, namely, flavylium cation (AH + ), quinoidal base (A), hemiketal (B), and cis and trans chalcones (Cc and Ct), are connected through four chemical reversible reactions, proton transfer, hydration, tautomerization, and cis- trans isomerization, as shown in Figure 2a for malvidin-3glucoside (oenin). Going forward, this system is labeled as the "flavylium multistate". The flavylium multistate is characterized by its thermodynamics and kinetics. The thermodynamics of this system can be described by its respective energy level diagram 179,180 (Figure 2a) or by a representation of the mole fraction distribution of the flavylium multistate species as a function of pH (Figure 2b). 181,182 Both representations can be extended to the anionic forms obtained through deprotonation of the hydroxyl substituents in neutral and basic solutions.</p>
        <p>Conveniently, the kinetics of the flavylium multistate are studied by adding a base to equilibrated solutions of the flavylium cations at pH ≤ 1 (direct pH jumps) 182,184 or by adding acid to equilibrated solutions at higher pH values back to pH ≤ 1 (reverse pH jumps). 185 Stopped-flow equipment is necessary to account for the kinetic steps over a time domain from milliseconds to several seconds.</p>
        <p>The sequence of events after a direct pH jump was reported for oenin, 186 but mutatis mutandis is the behavior of any multistate in which the cis-trans isomerization is much slower than other kinetic processes. After a direct pH jump, three distinct kinetic steps take place. The first step is a proton transfer, which occurs in submicroseconds, as shown in eqs 1 and eq 2. 184,187 This rate is faster than the mixing time of the stopped-flow and requires other techniques, such as temperature jumps 184 or flash photolysis 187 (see section 5 of this Review). Although the kinetic information of the proton transfer step cannot be obtained from the pH-jump experiments, the thermodynamic parameters (i.e., pK a ) can be found in a straightforward manner from the absorption spectra registered approximately 10 ms after a direct pH jump to several pH values (Figure 3a). During this short time interval, the other species are not yet present (B, Cc, and Ct), and therefore, using the spectroscopic data as a function of pH allows us to obtain the corresponding pK a 's, as reported in Figure 3b for oenin, which indicates the existence of three inflection points, resulting from the equilibrium between AH + ⇌ A ⇌ A -⇌ A 2-with pK a 's of 3.95, 6.3 and 8.5.</p>
        <p>For polyprotic systems, deconvolution techniques may be employed to estimate the individual spectra, and consequently, the color expressed by the pure species, as shown in Figure 3c for oenin. Based on experimental data supporting the higher acidity of OH groups in position 7 comparatively with 4'-OH, the neutral quinoidal base (A) is usually represented with the former deprotonated as in Figure 2a. For example, the pK a of 7-β-Dglucopyranosyloxy-4′-hydroxyflavylium was reported to be 5.4 while for 4′-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy-7-hydroxyflavylium it is 3.7. 188 Nevertheless, compounds comprising several OH groups can be considered to exist in tautomeric equilibria, with the Scheme 17. Acid-Base Polyprotic Equilibria for Cyanidin-3-glucoside Showing Some Relevant Tautomers a different tautomers contributing to the observed absorption spectra of these species, as exemplified in Scheme 17 for cyanidin-3-glucoside. Recent molecular dynamics and TDDFT studies suggested the quinoidal species shown in Scheme 17 as major species with other possible tautomers excluded on the basis of their computed DFT energies. 189 Although the computed absorption UV-vis spectra showed excellent agreement with the experimentally measured spectra, the authors acknowledged that entropic contributions, not taken into account in this study, may affect the relative energies computed for each species. The authors also highlighted the excellent agreement between the experimental spectrum measured at pH ≥ 7 and the one computed for A - 4'5 which comprises a distinctive shoulder-maximum two peak shape that is absent in the computed spectrum of A - 4'7 . This led the authors to suggest the A - 4'5 protomer to be the dominant colored species at neutral/slightly basic pHs, despite its higher computed energy, pointing out the negative effect of the higher energy shoulder at λ ≈ 440 nm to blue color expression and the glycosylation of position 5 to hinder this effect. It is worth mentioning that recent experimental studies with 3,5-diglucosides support this last observation. 190 Considering that the successive kinetic steps are much slower, the species AH + (red color) and A (purple color) as well as A - and A 2-(blue color) observed in neutral to moderately basic solutions can be considered to be at equilibrium during the subsequent kinetic events.</p>
        <p>In a moderately acidic medium, eqs 1 and 2 account for the proton transfer.</p>
        <p>[Equation 1 can be generalized to anionic species. Here, for the sake of simplicity, the first equilibrium is presented.]</p>
        <p>The second step presented in Figure 4a corresponds to the disappearance of AH + /A to form species B through the hydration reaction, followed by a faster tautomerization to give Cc. Since the hydration at the pH values used in direct pH jumps is generally much slower than tautomerization, the second step is kinetically controlled by the hydration. A particular feature of the hydration reaction is that it takes place from AH + and not from A (which does not hydrate in acidic to moderately acidic solutions). This achievement was a breakthrough discovery by Brouillard and Dubois 184 and is fundamental for the comprehension of the flavylium multistate kinetics. Equations 3 and 4 together with eq 5 account for this kinetic step.</p>
        <p>The expression that accounts for the second step was achieved in a straightforward manner considering that the species AH + and A on one side and B and Cc on the other are in fast equilibrium during the hydration step, in eq 5. 191</p>
        <p>Here, χ AH + and χ B are the mole fraction of AH + in its equilibrium with A and the mole fraction of B in its equilibrium with Cc, respectively. An example of the spectral variations that occur during the second step was again reported for oenin. 186 After a direct pH jump to pH = 5.0, the resulting quinoidal base disappears according to a biexponential process. The faster process occurs over a time scale of minutes, while the slower process, from the blue spectrum to the red spectrum shown in Figure 4a and b, takes a few hours. The faster kinetic process corresponds to the second step, controlled by the hydration reaction (Figure 2a), while the slower process corresponds to the third one (cis-trans isomerization). This large difference in rates between the second and third steps allows for the definition of a pseudoequilibrium to be reached before the significant formation of trans-chalcone. In fact, during cis-trans isomerization, the species AH + , A, B, and Cc have enough time to equilibrate. Usually, the observed rate constants are taken for a series of pH values to fit the data to eq 5 and to determine the respective rate and equilibrium constants (Figure 4c). This kinetic approach is not exclusive of anthocyanins and has been observed in many other flavylium-based multistates exhibiting very slow cis-trans isomerization kinetics. [The very slow isomerization rate may result from the very small mole fraction of Cc at the pseudoequilibrium or from the high cis-trans isomerization barrier, which is the case for anthocyanins.] The third step, leading to the formation of Ct, is given by eqs 6 and 7.</p>
        <p>where χ Cc is the mole fraction of Cc at pseudoequilibrium. Despite the small spectral variations from the pseudoequilibrium to equilibrium shown in Figure 4a (as observed in common anthocyanins), the respective rate constants can be calculated and represented as a function of the pH (Figure 5a). The absorption spectra at equilibrium in acidic medium versus the pH are shown in Figure 5b.</p>
        <p>The spectral variations of oenin in Figure 5b are fitted according to a single acid-base equilibrium with an acidity constant pK′ a = 2.3. This is a relevant result, which was already clearly intuited by Brouillard et al. in 1978, that allows for a dramatic simplification of the system. 182 In fact, the four equilibria represented by eqs 1, 3, 4, and 6 can be simplified as a single acid-base equilibrium involving AH + and the apparent conjugated base CB, in eq 8, defined as the sum of the concentrations of all the species in equilibrium with AH</p>
        <p>The constant K′ a was deduced from the definition of a single acid-base equilibrium through a mass balance and the definition of the equilibrium constants that allow the expression of all species in terms of the AH + concentration.</p>
        <p>The mathematical treatment is extended to the anionic forms. 192 This extension is particularly necessary when acylated anthocyanins, such as those found in heavenly blue anthocyanin (Ipomoea tricolor), 29,193 red cabbage, 194 Japanese morning glory (Pharbitis Ipomoea nil), 195 or sweet potato, 196 are studied as well as those in many synthetic flavylium compounds, which are stable in basic medium. The extension to the monoanionic species is presented here for the sake of simplicity, but it can be generalized to higher deprotonated forms. 192</p>
        <p>and K X/X-(X = A, B, Cc, and Ct) are the respective acid-base constants to give the anionic forms defined by eq 11.</p>
        <p>The equilibrium constants K′ a and K″ a are obtained experimentally by fitting the absorption spectra at the equilibrium, as shown in Figure 5b, upon its extension to the basic region. [In Figure 4b, this extension was not possible due to the decomposition of oenin in basic medium, which prevents a clear definition of the equilibrium for higher pH values.] Regarding pseudoequilibrium, the experimental constants K ^a and K ^^a are accounted for in eqs 8 and 10, respectively, by removing the term corresponding to Ct.</p>
        <p>To summarize, despite the complexity of the flavylium multistate, in particular, when it is extended to the anionic forms, AH + behaves as a simple diprotic acid, giving the respective conjugate bases CB and CB -. The mole fractions of AH + , CB, and CB -are obtained according to eq 12. It is worth noting that the mole fractions in eq 12 are obtained from the two experimental constants K′ a and K″ a . Fitting was performed with eq 7 and (b) the absorption spectra of oenin at equilibrium. The system behaves as a single acid-base equilibrium in acidic medium.</p>
        <p>with</p>
        <p>The mole fraction distribution of all the species of diprotic acid were calculated in a straightforward fashion from a mass balance and the definition of the equilibrium constants, eqs 1, 3, 4, and 6 as well as the acidbase constants K X/X -, as defined above in eq 11 (C 0 = total concentration of the anthocyanins). This substitution leads directly to the mole fraction distribution of the flavylium cation, from which all the others were directly obtained, eq 13.</p>
        <p>C 0 = total concentration of the flavylium-derived species and D defined in eq 12.</p>
        <p>The mole fractions presented in eq 13 can also be applied to the pseudoequilibrium with D ^defined by eq 14, substituting D.</p>
        <p>For more details regarding the mole fraction equations, please see the previously published work on this topic. 192</p>
        <p>Additional and complementary information from reverse pH jumps has been reported (Figure 6). 185,192 In Figure 6a, the kinetic trace after a reverse pH jump from pseudoequilibrated oenin solutions at pH = 4.5 is shown. The trace can be fitted to a biexponential equation, with rate constants of 90 s -1 and 12 s -1 . The initial absorption is due to the fast conversion of the quinoidal base in the flavylium cation during the mixing time of the stopped flow, together with the flavylium cation present at the initial pH of the pseudoequilibrium. [At this initial pH the fraction of flavylium cation is very small, but it is significant when the reverse pH jumps take place from lower pH values.] The faster observable kinetic trace was attributed to the conversion of the hemiketal into a flavylium cation. This conversion occurs because, at pH = 1, the hydration (at this pH essentially the dehydration contribution) becomes faster than the tautomerization (change of regime). 197,198 The slowest trace corresponds to the formation of more flavylium cations from cis-chalcone via the hemiketal. The normalization of the amplitudes of the traces, Figure 6a, to give (AH + + A + B + Cc +Ct) equal to unity, leads directly to the mole factions of the pseudoequilibrium species at pH = 4.5. The extension of the reverse pH jumps to higher pH values permits the evaluation of the composition of the multistate under more basic conditions (Figure 6b). As shown in Figure 6b, the mole fraction of CB, eq 15, can be decomposed in the contributions of A, B and Cc, eq 16. Mutatis mutandis, the identical conclusion is true for CB -, eq 17. 192</p>
        <p>Considering the mole fraction distribution of quinoidal base</p>
        <p>^, from eq 13 at pseudoequilibrium and that given by eq 16, it can be concluded that K a = a 0 K a ^. In extending this comparison to all the species, the following set of equations is obtained,</p>
        <p>which gives the equilibrium constants K a , K h , and K t from experimental values with good precision because they are based on a fitting with many points.</p>
        <p>Regarding the anionic species, the relations in eq 19 were deduced by using an identical comparison, allowing for the calculation of the acid-base constants X/X -, as introduced in eq 11. In eq 19, the coefficients a 1 , b 1 , and c 1 are the equivalents of a 0 , b 0 , and c 0 , respectively, for the anionic species. 192 The mole fraction of trans-chalcone at equilibrium was calculated from reverse pH jumps, as in that reported in Figure 6c, using a common spectrophotometer. The initial absorption corresponds to the total concentration of the species AH + , A, B, and Cc at equilibrium, and they have been converted in flavylium cations through a fast reaction (for the time resolution of this experiment) at very low pH values. The amplitude of the kinetic trace corresponds to the formation of more flavylium cations from Ct. The ratio between the amplitude of the trace divided by the total absorbance gives the mole fraction of transchalcone, χ Ct . The mole fraction distribution of Ct versus pH (including basic medium) was obtained by a series of reverse pH jumps, as shown in Figure 6c, to an extended series of pH values. The fitting of these values can be achieved from the representation of the mole fractions of the trans-chalcones versus pH.</p>
        <p>where d 0 and d 1 are defined by the fitting with eq 20.</p>
        <p>The mole fraction of the Ct species can be written as given above in eq 13 or in eq 20. A comparison between these two sets gives the constant K i and the acid-base</p>
        <p>At this point, all equilibrium constants of the flavylium multistate are obtained and the mole fraction of the species AH + , A, B, Cc, and Ct can be calculated, eq 13.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the reverse pH jumps from the equilibrium and pseudoequilibrium are powerful experimental procedures that allow for complete characterization of the thermodynamic parameters for the flavylium multistate. More details on this mathematical procedure can be found in a previously published work. 192 The rate constants were evaluated using eq 5 (k h and k -h ) and eq 7 (k i and k -i ). However, reverse pH jumps, such as that shown in Figure 6c, to very acidic medium give k -i , which is the value of the plateau in very acidic medium, as shown in Figure 5a, the limit of eq 7 at very high proton concentration. The rate constant k i is equal to the product K i k -i . The rate constants k i and k -i were also obtained from the cis-trans isomerization rates by fitting with eq 7. 191 Determination of the tautomerization rate constants can be done from the data of the reverse pH jumps (in the pH range where change of regime is observed) monitored by stopped flow: k -t is the rate of the slower kinetic step, and k t is calculated from the equilibrium constant K t . A global fitting of all the experimental data is convenient to ensure the coherence of the calculations. As mentioned above, in the case of k a and k -a , specific techniques are required, such as temperature jumps, 184 or when an excited state proton transfer for the flavylium cation is observed by nanosecond flash photolysis. 187 It is important to stress that the observed rate constants for the hydration step were obtained under very acidic conditions (for example, the experimental open circle points reported in Figure 4c), which were usually obtained through reverse pH jumps, in which a change of regime (hydration was faster than tautomerization) is observed, as described by eq 22 (and not eq 5). Equation 22is similar to eq 5, but in this case there is no reversibility from B to Cc since the former, as soon as it appears, gives AH + .</p>
        <p>When the pseudoequilibrium is not achieved, because there is not a high energy barrier for the cis-trans isomerization, B and Cc behave as steady state species. Once formed, they are consumed to give Ct in direct pH jumps or AH + /A in reverse pH jumps. Consequently, at lower pH values, the process is controlled by the cis-trans isomerization that increases with the pH increasing, while at higher pH values the control is made by the hydration reaction which decreases by pH increasing. The result is a bell-shaped curve as in Figure 7a. The situation is summarized in Scheme 18. 191 This kinetic behavior can be promptly identified because the direct conversion of AH + /A into Ct occurs via a single step of pseudo-first-order kinetics. Considering AH + in fast equilibrium M in ethanol/water (1:1). Fitting was performed using eq 10 for with A (X) on one side and B in fast equilibrium with Cc (Y) on the other to produce Ct (Z), a mechanism equivalent to a reversible kinetic scheme involving three species is required. When the steady state approach is applied to Y, eq 23 can be deduced. 191 k</p>
        <p>Equation 23 gives a bell-shaped curve when represented as a function of pH. In Figure 7a, the bell-shaped curve of luteolinidin is shown.</p>
        <p>For luteolinidin and related compounds, the rate constants of the reverse pH jumps are equal to the direct ones for the same final pH. Moreover, B and Cc are elusive species appearing at unmeasurable concentrations in the stationary state. However, the mole fractions of A and Ct can be calculated from the data of the bell-shaped curve to obtain the respective mole fraction distribution from the ratios K a /([H + ] + K' a ) and 7b).</p>
        <p>Once the equilibrium constants are calculated, the energy level diagram reported in Figure 2a is constructed from the thermodynamic relation ΔG 0 = -RT ln K, where ΔG 0 is the Gibbs free energy, R is the perfect gases constant, T is the temperature (Kelvin), and K is the equilibrium constant. A detailed description of how to construct this diagram can be found elsewhere. 180 Despite of the fact that UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (including stopped-flow) is the most common technique employed to monitor this system, other techniques, such as 1 H NMR, have also been used to investigate both the equilibrium and kinetics. 199,200 However, regardless of the physical-chemical spectroscopy used to monitored the system, it is presupposed that the anthocyanin concentration is fixed and the pH is variable. This procedure does not account for the considerable variations in these constants with the anthocyanin concentrations due to self-aggregation. 186 A systematic study on the effects of self-aggregation on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the network of chemical reactions in 3-glucoside anthocyanins clearly demonstrated that these parameters are, in fact, apparent constants that depend on the concentration of the dye (see Figure 8) and they can be extrapolated to infinite dilutions to account for the properties of the monomeric species. 186 Alternatively, the aggregation can be minimized by performing measurements at low anthocyanin concentrations, which is easily achieved by UV-vis spectrometry but not by 1 H NMR. In some plants, anthocyanins are sequestered in anthocyanic vacuolar inclusions (AVIs) promoting intramolecular copigmentation or self-association involving quinoidal bases, which explains the purple/blue color observed. 201 Thus, a challenge for the future is the development of new experimental tools and mathematical expressions that would consider the self-aggregation of anthocyanins.</p>
        <p>Although it is important to highlight that, in subclasses of flavylium compounds, such as 3-glucoside anthocyanins, the kinetic and thermodynamic properties are not substantially different among their homologues, 186 which are distinguished by the different substitution patterns in the B-ring, and these parameters can be dramatically affected by the introduction/ modification of substituents in critical positions of the flavylium skeleton. For this reason, there is growing interest in the search for new structures using innovative synthetic approaches to obtain different flavylium compounds with different hydroxylation/methoxylation patterns and also with different sugar moieties in simple systems (anthocyanin only) or by using a host-guest approach; see section 6. In section 4, the effects of the nature and position of the substituents decorating the flavylium structure on the reactivity/stability of these compounds is analyzed in more detail.</p>
        <p>The thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of the flavylium multistate are very dependent on the nature and position of the 2-phenylbenzopyrylium (flavylium) substituents. Regarding thermodynamics, they define the pH domain of the flavylium cation; the relative mole fraction distributions among the quinoidal base, hemiketal, cis-and trans-chalcones; and the respective anionic forms. In other words, the nature and position of the flavylium substituents define the position of each species in the energy level diagram of the flavylium multistate (see Figure 2a). Concerning the kinetics, the substituents also have a substantial influence on their profile. As an example, while 4′hydroxyflavylium and anthocyanins exhibit three distinct kinetic steps, 3-deoxyanthocyanidins and 7-hydroxyflavylium display two kinetic steps that follow a bell-shaped kinetic curve, as defined in section 2. The reactivity is also dramatically influenced by the substituents, in particular, in position 3. The paradigmatic example is the much higher stability of anthocyanins compared with anthocyanidins. 202 Alkyl substituents in position 4 prevent the hydration reaction in water. 203,204 A catechin substituent in position 8 of malvidin-3-glucoside (8,8-methylmethine catechin-malvidin 3-glucoside) hinders the hydration reaction and bisulfite discoloration. 205 The kinetics, thermodynamics and reactivity are also very dependent on the acylation of the sugars and are reviewed in section 4. 4</p>
        <p>Dracorubin is one of the molecules (in the quinoidal base form) that give the deep red color to dragoon's blood, a natural resin obtained from various trees, specifically Dracaena draco and Dracaena cinnabari belonging to the Liliaceae family or the palm tree Calamus draco (Daemonorops draco). 206 The structure of dracorubin was fully revealed in 1950 by Robertson, Whalley, and co-workers, 105,207 but it was not synthesized until 1976. 208 Dracorubin, while not claimed to be, is most likely the first pyranoflavylium structure (reported in the quinoidal base form) to appear in the literature. However, to our knowledge, no other similar structure was assigned before the 1990s, when the isolation of the first pyranoflavylium compounds extracted from wine, as shown in Scheme 20, 103,[209][210][211] triggered an increasing number of publications regarding the extraction, synthesis, and physical chemistry of pyranoflavylium compounds, as described in section 2. 30,135,[212][213][214][215] The chromatic features of natural and synthetic pyranoflavylium-type compounds are very different from their respective flavylium precursor pigments. 216,217 Particular attention has been paid to pyranoflavylium cations, which normally experience a hypsochromic shift in λ max (478-510 nm) compared to their flavylium precursors (λ max 516-541 nm), displaying a more orange color, except for portisins and pyranoanthocyanin dimers, which have revealed a bathochromic shift to more bluish to green hues (λ max 570-730 nm). 109,218 Unlike anthocyanins, pyranoanthocyanins are much less prone to water addition at C2 as a result of the presence of the pyranic ring D. 219 Consequently, the species from the flavylium cation to the quinoidal bases (neutral and anionic) practically do not experience a color fade, extending the appearance of the visible color toward much higher pH values, as shown in Scheme 21. 140,219,220 The formation of the colorless hemiketal was observed in 10-acetylpyranomalvidin-3-O-β-glucoside and 10acetyl-pyranopeonidin-3-O-β-glucoside, but its mole fraction is much lower than that in common anthocyanins and the color of the quinoidal bases is still dominant in the absorption spectra for higher pH values. 221 Pyranoflavylium compounds, together with 4-methyl-7-hydroxyflavylium (in water) and similar compounds with substituents in position 4, 222 are thus an exception to the general flavylium multistate because the hydration and the subsequent chemical reactions are not observed at all or only to a very small extent. 223 The acid-base chemical equilibria of several pyranoanthocyanins and pyrano-3-deoxyanthocyanidins with different substituents have been characterized by UV-vis and NMR spectroscopic techniques, and they are summarized in Scheme 22 and Table 1.</p>

        <p>Natural and synthetic furanoflavylium compounds, a term coined by Seshadri and Chakravarty, 227 have been reported in the literature. 228 Recently, Davies, Andersen, and co-workers 229 characterized the compound auronidin-2′-neohesperidoside The thermodynamics and kinetics of riccionidin A, the aglycone of the auronidin shown in Scheme 23, were described. 183 Riccionidin A was identified in several liverworts, such as, for example, in the Antarctic Cephaloziella varians, in response to an abrupt increase in UVB radiation, 230 and in the cell walls of Ricciocarpos natans 231 as well as in adventitious root cultures of Anacardiaceae member Rhus javanica. 232 Riccionidin A follows the same multistate as anthocyanins, as shown in Scheme 24. 183 The most dramatic difference when compared with other flavylium multistates is however the extremely slow interconversion rate between flavylium cation and trans-chalcone. This was observed during the riccionidin A synthesis carried out according to the paper of Dyker and Bauer. 233 The suitable aldehyde and ketone were dissolved in acetic acid saturated with HCl gas at 100 °C, to give initially the trans-chalcone. The evolution of the synthesis was monitored by UV-vis spectrophotometry, as shown in Figure 11. Despite the extreme temperature and acidity, the trans-chalcone was only converted into flavylium cation after 11 days. 183 A sequence of direct pH jumps (from flavylium cation) give spectral variations that are compatible with the existence of four acid-base constants, pK a1 = 4.2, pK a2 = 6.5, pK a3 = 7.7, and pK a4 = 10.7, as shown in Figure 12a. The colors at the representative pH values are shown in Figure 12b. It is notable that, similar to dracorubin and the other colorants of dragoon's blood resin, 206 as well as the auronidin reported by Davies, Andersen, and coworkers 229 and its aglycone, riccionidin A, 183 the flavylium cation is yellow and only the quinoidal bases range from red to purple. In riccionidin A, no significant spectral modifications were observed after 500 h at pH &lt; 4, indicating that the flavylium cation is stable in that pH region.</p>
        <p>At higher pH values, however, spectral variations corresponding to the disappearance of the quinoidal bases take place. The kinetics are multiexponential, with the slowest processes (t 1/2 &gt; 100 h at room temperature for pH values between 5.4 and 9.1) being attributed to the formation of decomposition products. Identically, trans-chalcone at pH = 5.0 in methanol/water (1:1) at 45 °C reacts according to a multiexponential process and the spectral variations are also compatible with the formation of decomposition products. HPLC-MS experiments performed after direct and reverse pH jumps allowed for the identification of the chromatographic peaks of the multistate as well as those of the decomposition products. The results are summarized in Scheme 25. 183 An inspection of Scheme 25 shows that experimental evidence was obtained for the five species of the multistate in acidic medium (red structures). The decomposition products were also identified by their respective mass spectra. Possible mechanisms to account for the decomposition products are also included.</p>
        <p>The flavylium multistates of the riccionidin model compounds 4′-hydroxyfuranoflavylium 234 and 4′,7-dihydroxyfuranoflavylium 228,234 were also described. For 4′-hydroxyfuranoflavylium, 234 a similar order of magnitude in the rate constants for hydration and tautomerization leads to peculiar kinetics from the flavylium cation (pH = 1) to the cis-chalcone. The hemiketal appears from the flavylium cation and disappears to give cischalcone, the observed species at pseudoequilibrium, as in Figure 13a. The kinetics followed by UV-vis absorption can be fitted with two consecutive reactions of the type A → B → C. This kinetic behavior was also corroborated by 1 H NMR. The equilibrium is reached from the isomerization of the cis-chalcone toward trans-chalcone, as exemplified by the trace after a pH jump to pH = 5.5, as shown in Figure 13b.</p>
        <p>The other riccionidin A model compound, 4′,7-dihydroxyfuranoflavylium, presents a kinetic pattern that is similar to that of the parent 4′,7-dihydroxyflavylium and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins; its kinetics toward equilibrium is a single monoexponential following a bell-shaped curve, but it is much slower than that of its parent compound without the bridge, as shown in Figure 13c. 234 The aglycone riccionidin A is very stable up to pH = 4, but its color is limited to the yellow flavylium cation and the reddish quinoidal base. According to Scheme 25, the hydroxyl in position 2′ seems to participate in the degradation processes in this compound. Further studies extended to the neutral and basic pH values with auronidins bearing a sugar in position 2′, like that reported by Davies, Andersen, and co-workers, 23 would be very interesting to assess the effect of the glucosylation.</p>
        <p>The synthesis of styrylflavylium compounds was patented by Jurd in 1967, Scheme 26. 203 His patent was based on two considerations: (i) "my researches have shown that the instability of natural pigments is primary due to the substituents on the 3position"; (ii) "in the compounds of the invention, the 3-position is unsubstituted or is provided particular substituents such as hydrogen, lower alkyl, phenyl, lower alkoxy and phenoxy." Moreover, he mentioned that "the compounds of the invention contain a styrene nucleous attached to the benzopyrylium at position 2. This styryl group has the advantage that the compounds exhibit deeper hues than is possible with the f lavylium type structure wherein a phenyl nucleous is attached at position 2."</p>
        <p>The multistates of styrylflavylium compounds have the theoretical ability to duplicate the number of their species through the addition of the cis isomers obtained during the rotation around the double bond of the styryl unit, as shown in Scheme 27. The thermodynamics and kinetics of the styrylflavylium compounds with a hydroxyl substituent in position 7, 7-hydroxy-2-(styryl)-benzopyrylium and 7-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxystyryl)benzopyrylium, were compared with their flavylium analogues. 58,235 They behave similarly in following kinetics, exhibiting a bell-shaped profile, as shown in Figure 14 for 7hydroxy-2-(styryl)-benzopyrylium, but with kinetic constants that are substantially lower than that of 7-hydroxyflavylium. The same finding was observed for 7-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxystyryl)benzopyrylium, but in this case the rates of the kinetic constants compared with those of the flavylium parent are similar. 235,236 No experimental evidence was found for the formation of the cisisomers from the styryl unit.</p>

        <p>The most common anthocyanins possess simple structures that are not able, by themselves, to confer the red color of the flavylium cation in vivo, except at a relatively acidic pH. With respect to the purple and blue colors, the situation is even more dramatic since the quinoidal base is a minor component of the anthocyanin's equilibrium at a moderately acidic pH, while to a lesser extent the same is true for the anionic quinoidal base. The vacuolar pH, at which anthocyanins exist in flowers and fruits, may vary considerably, but a pH of approximately 5 is often observed. 237 However, the pH of the vacuoles could be as low as 2.0 in citrus fruits 238 and 7.7 in some flowers. 29 A beautiful example of the strategies used by nature to overcome this limitation is the supramolecular structure of the molecular entity that confers the blue color to Commelina communis, as shown in Scheme 28. 28,39 An anthocyanin, a flavone, and a metal ion in a 6:6:2 ratio are organized into two parallel planes, each containing three anthocyanins, three flavones, and a metal ion that organizes the space. Other strategies have been adopted by nature for identical purposes. Copigmentation is the most frequently studied phenomenon and has been extensively reviewed. The focus of this section is the intramolecular copigmentation observed in anthocyanins bearing acylated residues. The fact that acylated anthocyanins exhibit higher resistance to color loss when compared with common anthocyanins could be viewed from two different perspectives: (i) the extension of the pH domain of the flavylium cation and the stabilization of the purple and blue colors at higher pH values and (ii) higher resistance to degradation. The term "stability" will be used in the sense of item (i), and "storage stability" will be used for item (ii). In this section, more recent examples will be provided with a few cases that have been revisited to frame recent achievements.</p>
        <p>The intramolecular copigmentation of a series of interesting acylated anthocyanin derivatives (Scheme 29) was investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. 239 The authors reported that these anthocyanins did not undergo hydration over the acidic to moderately acidic pH range (up to pH = 6), which implies that both flavylium cations and quinoidal bases are the primary species. It was proposed that the presence of acylated residues in positions 3′ and 7 optimizes the overlap of the acylated substituents, leading to enhanced interactions between the aromatic residues with the dye core, which results in improved dye stability.</p>
        <p>The peculiar behavior of heavenly blue anthocyanin, a peonidin derivative extracted from the flowers of morning glory (Ipomoea tricolor) that confers a purple color to buds and a blue color to petals, was associated early with the π-π stacking interaction of the acylated residues with the flavylium core, as indicated in Scheme 30. 29,37 The first quantitative study of the thermodynamics and kinetics of acylated anthocyanins was reported by Dangles et al., 195 as shown in Scheme 31, for anthocyanins extracted from another morning glory variety, the flower of Pharbitis Ipomoea nil (a pelargonidin derivative).</p>
        <p>Similarly to common anthocyanins, two kinetic processes that were well differentiated over time were observed by UV-vis spectrophotometry. The faster process is controlled by the hydration reaction, and the slower reaction is controlled by cistrans isomerization. The rate constants of the faster step from pigment 1 (0.38 s -1 ) to pigment 4 (6.7 × 10 -2 s -1 ) decrease continuously. This result constitutes the first reported quantitative argument for the existence of a protective effect of the hydration of the flavylium cation caused by the π-π stacking of the acylated residues with the flavylium core. The higher number of acylated residues results in more efficient protection toward hydration. Similar to the heavenly blue anthocyanin reported by Goto and Kondo, 37 the presence of the acylated residues not only confer stability to the color of the pigment but also allows for color diversification. 195 Recently, heavenly blue anthocyanin (from Ipomoea tricolor) was revisited, and its thermodynamics and kinetics were explained. 193 In addition to their flavylium core, what distinguishes the two acylated anthocyanins shown in Schemes 30 and 31 is the fact that in the first example pigment 3 possesses three acylated residues while in last pigment 4 only possesses two. In Scheme 32, the energy level diagrams of the quinoidal base and the hemiketal in relation to the respective flavylium cations are shown for both systems.</p>
        <p>Scheme 32 visualizes a common behavior. The increase in acylated residues has a weak effect on the stability of the quinoidal bases but has a dramatic effect on the instability of the hemiketal (in equilibrium with cis-chalcone), which becomes much more unstable when increasing the number of acylated residues. This effect is also dependent on the position and nature of the acylated units, as in pigments 2 and 3 in Scheme 31. It is noteworthy that three acylated residues invert the relative stability of the quinoidal base and the hemiketal in Scheme 32b.</p>
        <p>The mole fraction distribution of heavenly blue anthocyanin (from Ipomoea tricolor) pigment 3 is shown in Scheme 33a. At approximately pH = 7, relatively small changes in pH could lead to large color changes from purple to blue. Vacuolar pH measurements of morning glory petals in the abaxial epidermis have shown that the purplish red buds, purple flowers, and blue open flowers were at pH = 6.6, 6.9, and 7.7, respectively. 29 Scheme 30. Pigment 3 and the Respective Deacylated Derivatives, Pigment 2 (Bis-deacyl) and Pigment 1 (Tris-deacyl) 193 Scheme 31. Polyacylated Anthocyanins Reported by Dangles et al. 195 Chemical Reviews pubs.acs.org/CR Review Moreover, the spectra of pigment 3 in aqueous solutions at pH values of 7.68 and 6.37 corresponded to the reflective spectra of the open petal and bud, respectively. 29 By means of a series of direct and reverse pH jumps monitored by stopped flow, it was possible to calculate the hydration rate constants with great accuracy (Scheme 33b). According to these results, the increasing acyl residues from pigment 1 to pigment 3 led to a very significant decrease in the hydration constant (k h ) and an increase in the dehydration constant (k -h ), both of which increased the relative instability of the hemiketal species.</p>
        <p>Significant information regarding the effect of the acylation on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the flavylium multistate was obtained from an extensive study of red cabbage anthocyanins, as shown in Scheme 34. 240 In this study, three monoacylated anthocyanins were compared to three diacylated ones. Compared to the monoacylated anthocyanins, the hydration rate constants (k h ) of the diacylated anthocyanins are almost 1 order of magnitude lower. In addition, the dehydration rates (k -h ) are weakly affected. The equilibrium pK′ a changes from 2.65 to 2.69 (nonacylated) to 3.57-3.80 (diacylated), extending the pH range of the flavylium cation. In diacylated anthocyanins, the pK′ a is generally closer to the pK a than the monoacylated anthocyanins, which provides mathematical evidence that the mole fraction of the quinoidal base is higher in these compounds. Considering the case of the quinoidal base at pH values at which the anionic form can be neglected, its mole fraction is given by eq 24.</p>
        <p>The limit of eq 24 when [H + ] decreases is the K a /K′ a ratio.</p>
        <p>Although the equilibrium and rate constants were not fully calculated in neutral to weakly basic solutions, the authors stressed the appearance of the blue quinoidal bases. Degradation studies performed at room temperature and pH = 8 in the dark indicated that the diacylated anthocyanins exhibit substantially higher storage stability than the monoacylated anthocyanins. 240 Unlike for polyacylated anthocyanins, few examples of the effect of a single acylated unit on the anthocyanin color stability involving intramolecular interactions are reported in the literature. 39,40,175 In acylated anthocyanins, two different types of interactions coexist, intermolecular (self-association), as in common anthocyanins, and intramolecular interactions involving the acylated residue and the flavylium core, as described above. 33 Moreover, the type of the sugar spacer and acylation site are critical.</p>
        <p>One example of the effect of a single acylated residue was reported for malvidin 3-O-(6-O-p-coumaroyl)-glucoside (oenincoum) and malvidin 3-O-glucoside (oenin). 43 The results of a circular dichroism (CD) analysis of both compounds are presented in Figure 15. Interestingly, the CD signal corresponding to the intermolecular interaction disappears in both compounds at high temperatures (70-80 °C), but the CD signals of the intramolecular interaction of oenincoum in the visible spectrum remain (Figure 15). This Scheme 32 a a (a) Quinoidal base and hemiketal energy level diagram constructed with the equilibrium constants reported by Dangles et al. 195 (b) The same parameters for those reported by Mendoza et al. 193 This scheme is slightly different from the original because it was calculated taking by the value of K h (1 + K t ) to maintain the same conditions used to draw (a). phenomenon was corroborated by variable temperature NMR experiments. The signals for the H6 and H8 of the A-ring are shielded in oenincoum compared to oenin and move upfield in the NMR spectra suggesting a folded structure such as the one showed in Figure 16.</p>
        <p>Acylation of the sugars in anthocyanins is another strategy used in nature to display purple and blue colors, not only in flowers but also in vegetables, such as red cabbage, black carrots, sweet potatoes, and pigmented potatoes. 196,[241][242][243][244][245][246][247] Despite the higher storage stability of acylated anthocyanins, compared with nonacylated anthocyanins, their industrial applications, in particular, blue colors, are still limited by their storage instability. Encapsulation in biocompatible matrixes of these and other anthocyanins could be a research challenge for the future. 248,249 For example, calcium-alginate microparticles have been optimized to encapsulate an anthocyanin-rich extract from haskap berries (Lonicera caerulea), 250 and the degradation due to ascorbic acid of anthocyanins extracted from black carrots in beverages was reduced through encapsulation in various lecithin liposomal systems. 251 In recent years, a new series of acylated anthocyanins with aromatic/aliphatic acids have been synthesized to improve their liposolubility, and their stability in hydrophobic environments makes their application in lipid-based foods and cosmetics possible. Chemical approaches to obtain anthocyanin-fatty acid conjugates have been employed by using fatty acid chlorides in acetonitrile/dimethylformamide and triethylamine or via EDC- activated fatty acids (lauric acid), but the reactions revealed low regioselectivity, and complex mixtures of ester isomers were obtained. [252][253][254] Enzymatic reactions of pure anthocyanins and anthocyanin-rich extracts with fatty acids or fatty acid methyl esters in tertiary alcohols (tert-amyl alcohol, tert-butanol) or in aprotic solvents such as acetone, acetonitrile ,and pyridine using Candida antarctica lipase B as a biocatalyst have emerged as a novel approach to enabling higher regioselectivity and higher yields. [255][256][257][258][259] Anthocyanin-fatty acid adducts showed preferential organic miscibility in an octanol-water biphasic mixture and increased lipophilicity with chain length (Figure 17). Lipophilic anthocyanins up to the C8 chain length were also shown to have improved the antioxidant activity of their precursors, exerting a greater protective effect. 260 Table 2 shows the effect of the environment (micelles vs aqueous solution) and the fatty acid acyl residue on the thermodynamic properties of anthocyanins. Micellar systems largely increase the color stability of anthocyanins by increasing their pK′ a and pK h to high pH mainly due to the formation of ion-pair interactions between the flavylium cation and the negatively charged sulfate and phosphate groups and also due to the lower local pH at the negatively charged micellar surface.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, acylated anthocyanin with fatty acids was shown to extend even more the domain of red flavylium cation to higher pH values. The mole fraction of the purple quinoidal base was also stabilized at neutral pH compared with its respective precursors when dissolved in micellar systems (SDS and PEGylated phospholipids) (Figure 18). 257,[261][262][263] Comparatively with their precursors in the same media, anthocyanins grafted with aliphatic alkyl chains showed slightly higher flavylium cation stability (higher pK′ a ) in SDS micellar system while in the presence of mPEG-DSPE micelles the relative stabilization of lipophilic anthocyanins is more pronounced (i.e., the synergy between anthocyanin lipophilization and encapsulation is more clear). Overall, both SDS and mPEG-DSPE can be combined with these anthocyanin derivatives to achieve formulations with improved color stability being the absolute effects higher for SDS. However, further systematic studies are required to generalize the behavior observed in these particular systems.</p>
        <p>The photochemistry history of flavylium multistates and related work through 2012 were previously reviewed. 178 Nevertheless, this section will provide a short overview to frame more recent studies on this unique photochromic system.</p>
        <p>The photochemical/photochromic properties based on the flavylium multistate arise most often from photoinduced cistrans isomerizations as well as from photoinduced ring opening of the hemiketal (vide infra).</p>
        <p>In contrast with other popular photochromic systems, such as azobenzenes and diarylethenes, 265,266 the direct photochemical product (i.e., the cis-chalcone) is often subject to further transformations to yield other species, such as the flavylium cation or, to a lesser extent, the quinoidal base, as the final outputs of the photochemical reaction. In this respect, flavylium photochromic systems have some resemblances to spiropyrans, for which trans-cis photoisomerization of the merocyanine leads to the formation of the cis-species, which further evolves to the spiro form through a thermal ring-closing reaction, as indicated in Scheme 35. 267,268 Figure 19 summarizes how the trans-chalcone of flavylium multistates possessing a high cis-trans isomerization barrier responds to the light impulse. The trans-chalcone of 4′-methoxyflavylium is stable at pH = 7.0, as shown in Figure 19c. Light absorption by this species gives the cis-chalcone (in a domain of nanoseconds 178 ), which equilibrates in subseconds with hemiketal, 179 Figure 19a. At this pH, the flavylium cation is not thermodynamically accessible and the photoproducts are cis-chalcone in equilibrium with hemiketal. Although it reacts very slowly at room temperature, due to its high cis-trans isomerization barrier, a back reaction to the stable trans-chalcone occurs. At pH = 1.0, the trans-chalcone is metastable and the photoproduct cis-chalcone in fast equilibrium with hemiketal evolves spontaneously and irreversibly to the stable flavylium cation, as shown in Figure 19b.</p>
        <p>Reversible photochromism at a constant pH can be optimized by setting the pH at a value at which the flavylium cation can be effectively formed by light irradiation of the trans-chalcone but then reverts to the initial thermodynamically stable state when kept in the dark (also defined as the autolock pH; approximately pH = 3 for 4′-methoxyflavylium).</p>
        <p>In general, anthocyanins are poor photochromic compounds due to the small mole fraction of trans-chalcone at equilibrium. 180,269 From this point of view, 3-deoxyanthocyanidins are much better photochromic compounds because transchalcone (major) together with a quinoidal base (minor) are the species present at moderately acidic pH values at equilibrium. The photochromism of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins was recently reviewed. 270 Models of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins were synthesized, 72 and their respective photochromism was investigated. 188 Flash photolysis over a time scale of seconds/subseconds is a very powerful tool for determining the kinetics of the flavylium multistate. 271 This technique was performed in two representative compounds, 4′-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy-7-hydroxyflavylium and 7-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy-4′-hydroxyflavylium ions, without and with a cis-trans isomerization barrier, respectively, as shown in Figure 20. The cis-chalcone is formed during the lifetime of the flash (milliseconds) and corresponds to the initial bleaching at 360 nm (the maximum absorption of the trans-chalcone) because the trans isomer has a higher mole absorption coefficient than the cis isomer. Regarding 4′-β-D-glucopyranosyloxy-7-hydroxyflavylium, the increase of the flavylium cation absorption is accompanied by a partial recovery of the transchalcone absorption. Both traces have the same rate constant. This finding is explained by the lack of a cis-trans isomerization barrier. Once formed, cis-chalcone disappears through two competitive pathways, (i) forward to form a flavylium cation and (ii) backward to recover part of the trans-chalcone (Scheme 36).</p>
        <p>The fraction of trans-chalcone that was not completely recovered corresponds to the fraction of the flavylium cation that formed. In a slower kinetic step (not shown in Figure 20), the absorption of the flavylium cation starts to disappear at the same time that trans-chalcone is recovered. For 7-β-Dglucopyranosyloxy-4′-hydroxyflavylium, there is a cis-trans isomerization barrier and no recovery of the trans-chalcone takes place, as shown in Figure 20b.</p>
        <p>Photochromic systems, such as that shown in Figure 19, were explored as models for optical memories capable of write-lockread-unlock-erase actions.</p>
        <p>The trans-chalcone as a stable species at pH = 7.0 or a metastable species at pH = 1.0 is the photoactive species, Scheme 37. At pH = 7.0, irradiating the Ct leads to the formation of a Cc that equilibrates with B in subseconds. Despite the high cis-trans isomerization barrier, these two species tend to revert back to the stable Ct slowly. Moreover, using light to read the system at this point is not convenient because irradiating cischalcone gives trans-chalcone and erases the signal. The lock step consists of a pH jump to pH = 1. At this pH, the Cc in equilibrium with B moves spontaneously to the flavylium cation, constituting a stable signal, which can be read at will. To erase the memory model, it is necessary to unlock the system through Numerous flavylium multistates with similar behaviors have been reported and previously reviewed. 178 Based on the same concept, a system using hyper-Rayleigh scattering experiments and quantum chemical calculations demonstrated that nonlinear optics can be used to probe unequivocally, within a nondestructive process, the multiple electronic states that are activated upon pH and light-triggered transformations of the 4′hydroxyflavylium ion, as shown in Scheme 38. 272 In addition to cis-trans isomerization, the flavylium multistate has another potential source of photochromism: the ringopening closure (tautomerism), as shown in Scheme 39.</p>
        <p>The photoinduced ring opening of hemiketal was considered as a possible pathway in flavylium-based photochromic systems by Matsushima et al. 274 and Wunscher et al. 275 Unequivocal experimental evidence of this phenomenon was reported by Macanita et al., who observed that, in three common anthocyanins (pelargonin, cyanin, and malvin), phototautomerization yields cis-chalcone in the ground state within a few picoseconds, Figure 21. 276 According to Macanita et al., the formation of trans-chalcone from the steady state irradiation of hemiketal takes place in two steps: (i) the hemiketal excited state leads to the ground state cischalcone via a conical intersection and (ii) the irradiation of cischalcone leads to trans-chalcone to reach a photostationary state. An alternative mechanism is the existence of excited state energy transfer that gives Cc* from B*, the Ct (and Cc) in the ground state obtained from the further decay of Cc*.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the case of anthocyanins, in which the transchalcone is a minor species, 4′,7-dihydroxy-3-methoxyflavylium possesses a high mole fraction distribution of trans-chalcone together with the major hemiketal species. 273 This property allows for both photochromic systems to be explored, as addressed by two different light inputs, which is shown in Figure 22.</p>
        <p>Irradiation of hemiketal at 275 nm leads to a photostationary state in which trans-chalcone is formed (green spectrum). In the opposite direction, the irradiation of chalcone at 365 nm results in another photostationary state in which hemiketal is the dominant form (brown spectrum). Equilibrium is thermally reached from each photostationary state.</p>
        <p>Studying flavylium multistate fluorescence is difficult due to the high number of species that are emitting together. The exceptions are flavylium cations at sufficiently low pH values (to be the sole species in solution) and systems in which hydration is prevented, as in flavylium cations with alkyl substituents in position 4 or pyranoanthocyanins. Similar to other phenols like β-naphthol, flavylium cations exhibit excited state proton transfer (ESPT). 277 This phenomenon is illustrated in Scheme 40. 278 Light absorption from the flavylium cation leads to its excited state. Since the rate constants k* a and k* -a are much faster (picoseconds) than the rate of the decay processes from both excited states to the ground states, a steady state equilibrium under continuous irradiation is quantified by K* ap = (k* a / k* -a )(τ AH+ /τ A )(1/η a *), with η A * = k* a /(k c +k f +k* a ). 279 As Macanita. 276 exemplified for β-naphthol in Scheme 40b, the excitation of the acidic form at pH = 5, for example, leads to emission of the acid plus that of the base. The parameter n A* measures the efficiency of the ESPT from the excited acidic form. The anthocyanins malvidin-3,5-diglucoside (malvin), cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside (cyanin), and pelargonidin-3,5-diglucoside (pelargonin) are among the flavylium compounds exhibiting ESPT. 280 4-Methyl-7-hydroxyflavylium is one of the flavylium cations that was studied in more detail, as shown in Figure 23. [281][282][283] The emission of 4-methyl-7-hydroxyflavylium is shown in Figure 23. The blue-shifted fluorescence emission of the flavylium cation evolves toward a red-shifted emission of the quinoidal base by increasing pH. The excitation of the flavylium cation at pH = 1 or pH = 2, (pK a = 4.4) gives essentially the emission of the quinoidal base, as shown in Figure 23b. In fact, the efficiency of this process is 0.93, and for that reason, these types of compounds are known as superphotoacids. 280 It is worth noting that even in extremely acid solutions, such as [H + ] = 1 M, there is still significant emission from the quinoidal base (pK* ap = -1 ± 0.3).</p>
        <p>ESPT could also give information regarding the rate constant of the ground state through nanosecond laser flash photolysis experiments as a function of pH. After the flash at a wavelength at which the flavylium cation absorbs, high amounts of the quinoidal base in its excited state are formed in pico-seconds, and it later decay to its ground state. This change leads to an excess of quinoidal base in the ground state, and the observed rate back to the equilibrium is given by k obs = k a + k -a [H + ]. The fitting of the observed rate constant as a function of [H + ] gives k a and k -a , which should coincide with the pK a (K a = k a /k -a is calculated independently, as shown in section 2). 187,280 In Table 3, some examples of these rates are presented. In particular, the constant k -a seems to be controlled by diffusion. Recent studies on the photophysics of synthetic pyranoflavyliums (Scheme 41) showed that these compounds also display photoacid properties, with pK* a values in the 0.2-0.7 range, depending on the substituents that decorate the pyranoflavylium core. 284,285 However, compared with their flavylium analogues, the rate of excited-state proton transfer was found to be approximately 2 orders of magnitude slower for pyranoflavylium salts, resulting in less efficient photoacidity and much longer excited state lifetimes.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, although the formation of triplet states at room temperature has not been clearly demonstrated for other flavylium cations, the pyranoflavylium salts of Scheme 41 were observed to readily form triplet states in acidic acetonitrile solutions at room temperature. 286 The triplets where shown to have microsecond lifetimes and are quenched by oxygen forming singlet oxygen detected by its emission in the nearinfrared spectral region.</p>
        <p>One of the most frequently reported practical uses of fluorescent probes is in optical imaging and sensing. 287 These analytical techniques are among the most powerful tools for targeting tissues and organs, and they are therefore very useful in clinical diagnoses and surgical procedures. Flavylium-type dyes have been explored as fluorophores for use in optical imaging. Among other important features, as previously mentioned, these dyes must comprise substituents that block the hydration of the flavylium cation, leading to improved stability in biorelevant media. Earlier work performed in the 1990s already indicated the potential of these chromophores for use as fluorescent lasers and near-infrared dyes. [288][289][290] More recently, flavylium-based fluorescent probes have reemerged in different studies focused in the development of dyes with imaging applications, although they are not always identified as flavylium compounds. 291,292 In the following paragraphs, two representative examples are described to illustrate the potential of these compounds in the field.</p>
        <p>Locked-flavylium dyes (Scheme 42a) were shown to display unique fluorescence ratiometric responses in three channels by tuning the intramolecular charge transfer efficiencies suitable for three-color ratiometric imaging of pH in living cells. 293 A subsequent study of these compounds confirmed the thermodynamic stability of the locked flavylium dyes against hydration under neutral and acidic pH conditions but also showed that in the presence of CTAB micelles, equilibrium is driven to the trans-chalcone, raising a question about whether the similar fading of the fluorescent flavylium and quinoidal base species may occur in complex biological media. 294 More recently, 295 a new class of polymethine dyes with dimethylamino flavylium heterocycles emitting in the nearinfrared (NIR, λ = 700-1000 nm) and in the shortwave infrared (SWIR, λ = 1000-2000 nm) ranges was developed (Scheme 42b). The synthesized dyes revealed high brightness, good biocompatibility, and strong photophysical properties (enhanced photostability, high absorption coefficients, and high fluorescence quantum efficiency). The in vivo performance of the dye in phospholipid micelle formulation suggests that this polymethine flavylium is a promising SWIR imaging agent that could be translated from diagnostics to the clinic. 296 The photosensitizing property of the flavylium-based dyes has been explored for applications in dye-sensitive solar cells (DSSCs). Cherepy et al. elucidated the photoelectrochemical behavior of anthocyanin dyes extracted from blackberries, and the first DSSC using an anthocyanin, cyanidin-3-glucoside, displayed a conversion yield of 0.56%. 297 Anthocyanins such as delphinidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside can anchor efficiently to TiO 2 through the catechol unit, but the donoracceptor pattern is not optimized for electron transfer. Considering that many other natural and synthetic flavylium compounds have the same chemical equilibria network as those observed in anthocyanins, a series of flavylium derivatives were synthesized and tested in DSSCs. The best yield conversion of 3.05% was obtained for the compound 7-diethylamino-3′,4′dihydroxyflavylium. 298 More recently, the impact of the catechol versus carboxyl linkage on the DSSC performance of synthetic pyranoflavylium salts was reported. The presence of the catechol unit was shown to be essential for the efficient electron injection of the dye into TiO 2 semiconductors since carboxylic units showed a deleterious effect during electron injection due to their electron withdrawing character. 299 Recently, the orbital energies obtained from vertical excitations in TD-DFT calculations of a series of anthocyanins were claimed to be a screening method to provide complementary information to experimental data in DSSCs. 300</p>
        <p>Both natural and synthetic flavylium compounds have a rich history in supramolecular chemistry, primarily motivated by the quest to rationalize the color stabilization phenomenon in natural systems. This exploration led to several important studies regarding self-association, copigmentation, and interactions with metal cations, which have been reviewed previously. 39,40 Furthermore, the pH-dependent photochemical properties observed in synthetic flavylium salts, in particular, the reversible interconversion between neutral and cationic species, offer highly attractive features for applications in supramolecular chemistry, nanotechnology, or biological systems. [301][302][303][304][305] However, this family of photochromic compounds has been overlooked, and its potential is now beginning to emerge. Hostguest systems involving the flavylium multistate and different classes of hosts ranging from simple macrocycles to polymeric materials can be explored. The first consist of monodisperse oligomeric receptors with well-defined binding sites that allow for a detailed molecular-level characterization of their complexes using routine spectroscopic techniques. The second involves large macromolecules consisting of more or less polydisperse mixtures comprising several binding sites (or sets of binding sites) that often yield elusive detailed molecular-level pictures of their complexes. Given the differences between these two class systems, which make direct rational comparisons between binding properties unfeasible, they will be reviewed in separate sections.</p>
        <p>Host-guest chemistry is a subfield of supramolecular chemistry focused on molecular recognition (noncovalent binding) of small molecules or ions (guests) by larger receptors (hosts) to form a host-guest complex. 306 Examples of hostguest complexes span from enzymes and their substrates to simple complexes formed by a cation bound to a synthetic macrocycle, such as a crown ether. Low molecular weight synthetic molecules, such as macrocycles, molecular clips and tweezers, which have well-defined and structurally preorganized binding sites, can be highly effective supramolecular receptors for binding small guest molecules or ions. Among the different low molecular weight host molecules for flavylium cations, molecular clips were previously reviewed, 178 and thus, this section focuses on cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, and p-sulfonatocalixarenes (Scheme 43).</p>
        <p>Cyclodextrins (CD) are macrocyclic oligosaccharides, with the most common ones being those with six (α-CD), seven (β-CD), and eight (γ-CD) D-glucose units linked by α-1,4-glucose bonds. 307,308 The primary complexation properties of these water-soluble host molecules arise from their conical structure with a defined hydrophobic cavity that can accommodate different molecules and ions of the appropriate shape, size and polarity within their interior. Generally, the affinity of CD toward target guest molecules increases for more hydrophobic species.</p>
        <p>Due to their unique structural features, cyclodextrins have been used in several industrial sectors, with applications in food, pharmacy, cosmetics, agriculture, and others with relevance to anthocyanin research. In the food industry, these natural host molecules are primarily used to control flavor release, to mask odors and tastes, to stabilize emulsions, to control ingredient degradation (thermal and oxidative) and to control or mask colors. 309,310 Earlier studies on the impact of CDs on the stability of anthocyanins indicated the absence of interactions among γ-, βand α-CD and sterically hindered 3,5-diglycosylated anthocyanin species. 199,311,312 However, the complexation of anthocyanin 3-monoglycosides has been reported by different groups. [311][312][313][314][315] Cyclodextrins lead to significant decreases in the absorption bands of flavylium cations under acidic conditions, suggesting that their equilibrium is shifted toward colorless species due to their selective inclusion in the host's cavity. Due to its bleaching effect, this behavior was called anticopigmentation by Dangles et al. 313 β-CD shows stronger anticopigmentation effects than for α-CD, which are attributed to the higher affinity of the flavylium multistate species toward the former.</p>
        <p>Quantitative studies demonstrated that the binding constants of β-CD for the colorless species of two model anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, are approximately 30 fold higher than the ones observed for the respective flavylium cations, in line with the so-called anticopigmentation effect. The effects of β-CD and α-CD on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reaction network of cyanidin-3-Oglucoside were investigated by de Freitas and co-workers. 314 These authors found that both pK′ a and pK a decrease in the presence of β-CD, consistent with the selective binding of the neutral species. This host was also observed to decrease the hydration rate constants slightly and accelerate the apparent cistrans isomerization. This last kinetic effect was also observed for a synthetic flavylium compound in an earlier study. 316 As in previous studies, α-CD was found to have only moderate effects on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the cyanidin-3-O-glucoside reaction network. Detailed investigations through NMR and molecular dynamic simulations suggested the preferential binding of the hemiketal and the cis-chalcone of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside through the inclusion of the A and C ring in the cavity of the β-CD (Scheme 44) while, somewhat surprisingly, the trans-chalcone seems to establish weaker interactions. 315 The selectivity of CD toward more hydrophobic species has been widely explored to devise many different stimuli responsive systems using guest molecules that change their polarity or ionization state upon application of stimuli such as light, redox potential, temperature, or added chemicals. 303,[317][318][319][320][321] In this context, synthetic flavylium compounds were found to be excellent candidates for photoresponsive host-guest cyclodextrin-based systems owing to their potential to interconvert between neutral and charged species using light inputs. [322][323][324][325][326][327][328] The influence of β-CD complexation on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the network of reactions involving different synthetic flavylium derivatives was investigated in great detail using different techniques, including NMR, ITC, circular dichroism, UV-vis, and stopped-flow. [322][323][324][325][326][327][328] All these studies revealed that, among the flavylium multistate species, the neutral uncolored species (B, Cc, and Ct) bind with higher affinity (K usually in the 10 3 M -1 range) to the hydrophobic cavity of β-CD while the respective flavylium cations do not bind or show much weaker affinities.</p>
        <p>Ct is the most stable species of many synthetic flavylium multistates under slightly acidic conditions. The fact that Ct shows a much higher affinity toward β-CD than AH + and A (often the ultimate species formed after photoirradiation of Ct) provides the required conditions to devise robust photo-responsive host-guest complexes. As shown in Figure 24, the irradiation of Ct in the presence of 8 mM β-CD (K = 9 × 10 3 M -1 , 88% of complex) leads to the formation of AH + , which binds very weakly to cyclodextrin (K &lt; 10 M -1 , &lt; 8% of complex) and is therefore (photo)ejected from the cavity of the host upon irradiation. 326</p>
        <p>) constitute another important class of neutral water-soluble host molecules that were explored as synthetic receptors for flavylium compounds. [329][330][331][332][333][334][335][336][337][338][339] These highly symmetric and rigid pumpkin-shaped macrocycles containing n glycoluril units linked by 2n methylene bridges result from the acid condensation of glycoluril with formaldehyde. Depending on the reaction conditions, different homologues that differ only in the number of glycoluril units present in their structure can be obtained. This feature dictates the cavity sizes, which are crucial for the binding affinity and stoichiometry toward different guest molecules and also for solubility; odd-numbered CB[n]s are more soluble in pure water. CB6, CB7, and CB8 are by far the most frequently investigated homologues, owing to their appropriate cavity size for the binding of small organic and inorganic compounds, including drugs, biomolecules, dyes, and other functional molecules with potential application in drug delivery, catalysis, sensors, etc. [340][341][342][343] Compared with other water-soluble synthetic receptors, CB[n] host molecules show unpaired binding properties that reach attomolar affinities for highly complementary guest molecules. 344 The combination of a hydrophobic cavity with the highly electronegative character of the two carbonyl rimmed portals of CB[n]s makes these receptors particularly suitable for binding positively charged organic guests. 345 However, it should be stressed that the hydrophobic effects (i.e., the release of highenergy water from the CB[n] cavity) make a major contribution to the complexation driving energy and, in exceptional cases, neutral guests may bind with similar or higher affinities than their positively counterparts. [346][347][348] Based on the previously mentioned recognition properties of CB[n]s, it was not surprising to verify that synthetic flavylium cations are efficiently complexed by CB7 (which has the appropriate cavity volume to include one flavylium guest) with binding constants varying between 10 5 and 10 7 M -1 . The stability of the complexes was found to depend on the position and nature of the substituents decorating the flavylium skeleton being more tightly bound to those comprising amino groups and the nonfunctionalized, more hydrophobic, B-ring. 331 The effect of CB7 complexation on the pH-dependent stability of the flavylium cations was investigated for 7hydroxyflavylium, 3′,4′,7-trihydroxyflavylium, and 3′,4′,7-trimethoxyflavylium. 329,330,337 In all cases, CB7 increased the stability of the colored flavylium at less acidic pH values, with the quite remarkable effect of 3′,4′,7-trimethoxyflavylium presumably due to the formation of a 2:1 host:guest complex. Interestingly, for compound 7-hydroxyflavylium, complexation with CB7 was demonstrated to not only stabilize the flavylium cation but also the quinoidal base at a neutral pH, which implies selectivity for this colored form over the colorless hemiketal and chalcones.</p>
        <p>The possibility of using trans-chalcone-flavylium photoswitches to prepare light-responsive CB[n] complexes as initially proposed for compound 3′,4′,7-trihydroxyflavylium 329 was further explored to control the complexation of photochemically silent functional molecules (such as drugs) via competitive binding. 334 Memantine, a drug prescribed to Alzheimer's patients, was selected to demonstrate the proof of concept. With a binding constant of 2.5 × 10 4 M -1 , this value is high enough to preclude the competitive dissociation of the complex in the presence of trans-chalcone (3.0 × 10 2 M -1 ) but is lower than that determined for flavylium cation 14 (9.0 × 10 5 M -1 ), thus fulfilling the required conditions to observe competitive displacement of the drug upon irradiation (Scheme 45). Under the selected conditions (pD = 4.4), the memantine/CB7 complex cannot be dissociated by the trans-chalcone, but upon irradiation, the high affinity flavylium cation is efficiently generated, displacing the drug from the CB7 cavity by competitive binding.</p>
        <p>Flavylium-based photoswitches behave as photobases (the formation of the cation consumes H + ) and require slightly acidic conditions to have thermodynamic access to the flavylium cation. Quantitatively, this property can be evaluated by determining the apparent pK a of the photostationary state. Compounds such as 14, which have high isomerization barriers, display a very slow thermal recovery by the trans-chalcone from the photostationary state. When the system is irradiated at a neutral pH, B and Cc are the major products and they can be converted into the flavylium cation by acidifying the solution after irradiation. Conversely, the system behaves as an AND molecular logic gate with H + (i.e., the output signal/function is only verified when both stimuli are simultaneously applied) and light serving as inputs. [349][350][351] While the output (i.e., the formation of the flavylium and consequent release of the drug molecule) of the two-input system described above does not depend on the order by which the stimuli are applied, systems that depend on the sequence of the applied stimuli are less common and more difficult to obtain. With this context in mind, a photoresponsive flavylium-based host-guest system that shows sequential logic was developed. 336 This was achieved by using a chalcone-flavylium photoswitch with a lower thermal cis-trans isomerization barrier that upon photochemical excitation at neutral pH relaxes back quantitatively to the trans-chalcone, preventing the accumulation of hemiketal and cis-chalcone at the photostationary state. At lower pH values, however, the rate of the dehydration, which is accelerated by the [H + ], becomes faster than that of the isomerization and the flavylium cation is efficiently formed. Due to these kinetic features, the positively charged product is only formed if the two inputs are applied in the correct order, first H + and then light.</p>
        <p>The system was then coupled with a host-guest system. CB8 was selected due to its ability to simultaneously include two guest molecules in its cavity. This feature has been explored in a variety of contexts, including supramolecular polymers, hydrogels, microcapsules, surface patterning and protein dimerization. [352][353][354][355][356][357][358] A Phe-Gly-Gly tripeptide was selected as a guest molecule owing to its cooperative 1:2 host:guest binding with CB8 (overall K = 1.5 × 10 11 M -2 ) and its relevance for protein recognition and dimerization. [358][359][360] UV-vis absorption and fluorescence host-guest titrations of flavylium cation 15 with CB8 showed the cooperative encapsulation of two guests with K = 1.3 × 10 12 M -2 . However, the trans-chalcone is only weakly complexed by CB8, satisfying the required conditions for the stimuli-responsive activation of an effective competitor under biologically relevant conditions. The operation of this system is summarized in Scheme 46, and, as in the case of the CB7:memantine complex, the release of the peptide after the correct sequence of the pH (7.4 → 4.5) and light (365 nm) was unequivocally demonstrated by simple 1 H NMR experiments.</p>
        <p>p-Sulfonatocalix[n]arenes (SC[n]s) comprise a class of negatively charged macrocyclic host molecules that show high affinity and selectivity for cationic guests. 361 Due to their exceptional binding properties, water solubility, and low toxicity, these macrocyclic receptors have become important building blocks for developing host-guest systems with potential applications of biological and pharmaceutical intertest. [362][363][364] Similar to CB[n]s, SC[n]s have suitable properties for the selective binding of flavylium cations. This behavior was confirmed by Basi ́lio and co-workers, who investigated the formation of host-guest complexes between a series of synthetic flavylium cations and SC4. 365 Using a combination of UV-vis absorption, fluorescence, and 1 H NMR techniques, the authors determined 1:1 association constants in the range of 6 × 10 3 -1 × 10 5 M -1 for the binding of selected flavylium cations to the SC4 system at pH = 2. Compound 14 was investigated in more detail to demonstrate the potential of the system to devise photoresponsive host-guest complexes. The binding constant of the flavylium cation (K = 3.5 × 10 4 M -1 ) was found to be approximately 3 orders of magnitude higher than that found for the respective trans-chalcone species (K = 40 M -1 ), which provided the required conditions for robust photoinduced complexation. The optimal conditions for operating the photoresponsive host-guest system required slightly acidic pH values (4.0), which allow for &gt;95% conversion of the flavylium cation upon irradiation and the recovery of approximately 95% of the trans-chalcone in the dark at 70 °C. The photoresponsive host-guest system was also applied to regulate the complexation of photoinactive biologically relevant guests (acetylcholine, lysine, and arginine) by competitive binding using a similar strategy to that described above for CB7 (Scheme 47).</p>
        <p>Rotaxanes and pseudorotaxanes, along with catenanes, are probably the most widely studied prototypes of molecular machines with great potential for advanced applications in nanotechnological devices. [366][367][368] Among the various structures that have been reported to date, stimuli-responsive bistable (pseudo)rotaxanes made from an axle molecule containing two recognition sites for macrocyclic wheel are particularly attractive owing to the possible controlling location of the wheel with external stimuli. These apparently simple molecular devices have found numerous potential applications in information processing, molecular muscles, catalysis, drug-delivery and sensing, to name a few. [369][370][371][372][373][374] Flavylium compounds and CB[n], in particular, CB7, were demonstrated to be a successful combination for the development of stimuli-responsive bistable pseudorotaxanes.</p>
        <p>The axle molecule 17 was designed to explore the photoresponsive properties of flavylium-based pseudorotaxanes (Scheme 48). 338 The triethylalkylammonium headgroup was carefully selected owing to the ability of CB7 to include this residue deep inside its cavity with high affinity. 1 H NMR experiments readily confirmed this binding mode for transchalcone 17a. However, for flavylium cation 17d, the phenyl group is included inside the cavity, exposing the tetraalkylammonium group to the bulk solution. This differential binding fulfilled the required conditions for stimulated shuttling movements upon irradiation.</p>
        <p>As demonstrated by pH-dependent photochemical experiments, photoinduced CB7 shuttling from the tetralkylammonium binding site in 17a to the phenyl site in 17d is gated by the pH of the solution (Scheme 48). Conversely, at pH &gt; 8, irradiation of the trans-species 17a leads to the efficient formation of a cis-chalcone 17b/hemiketal 19c mixture that does not evolve to cation 17d, and therefore, the CB7 wheel is not translocated. Notably, at pH &lt; 5, flavylium cation 17d is efficiently formed (through 17b and 17c), resulting in the translocation of the CB7 macrocycle. An apparent pK a = 6.1 was determined for the pH-gated photoinduced translocation (i.e., 17d formation), which matches the requirements for improved performance in slightly acidic yet biologically relevant conditions. These properties together with the strong fluorescence emission (Φ = 0.24) of the flavylium pseudorotaxane offer appealing conditions for potential advanced biomedical applications.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to devise multiresponsive pseudorotaxanes, another viologen-flavylium axle derivative was synthesized and was shown to form inclusion complexes with CB7. 335 chalcone to flavylium interconversion, the CB7 molecule was again shown to translocate CB7 from the viologen to the flavylium unit. However, despite its redox and pH-responsive properties, the system showed poor photoinduced chalcone-toflavylium interconversion in the reversible pH range.</p>
        <p>The interactions between polymeric materials including biological and synthetic polymers and also inorganic matrixes, such as zeolites, clays, and mesoporous materials, and anthocyanins have been thoroughly investigated, primarily as a strategy to develop formulations that improve color by selective interactions with colored species of the flavylium multistate and that promote the thermal stability of this class of natural dyes against irreversible degradation. [375][376][377][378][379][380][381][382][383][384][385] Among the different macromolecules, negatively charged polyelectrolytes have been shown to establish stronger interactions with the flavylium species, providing a potential approach to address color stabilization by increasing the pH domain of the colored cationic species.</p>
        <p>The recognition of flavylium multistate compounds by proteins has also attracted considerable attention due to the potential of these biomacromolecules to impact their transport, stabilization, and sensory properties. Despite the considerable amounts of data published on this topic, detailed investigations at the molecular level are still scarce, and thus, the binding of flavylium multistate species and their effects on the flavylium network of reversible reactions are not well documented. 31 Moreover, the complexity of both flavylium multistate systems and biomacromolecules is helping to increase the challenge of in-depth characterizations on these systems. Unlike the copigmentation phenomena with small molecules, established characterization protocols for the interaction of biomacromolecules with flavylium compounds have not been implemented. This lack of information makes the comparison of reported data, which were obtained under a variety of conditions and using different techniques, less feasible and thus hampers a more generalized understanding of these systems.</p>
        <p>Plant cell wall polysaccharides such as pectin have received considerable attention due to their potential to bind anthocyanins. 386 Studies on the interactions of two anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-glucoside) with pectin from citrus fruits using NMR, UV-vis, and molecular dynamics simulation have suggested a moderate interaction between the hemiketal species at pH = 4 (K = 4.0 × 10 3 and 5.5 × 10 3 M -1 for delphinidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, respectively) and the stronger binding of the flavylium cation under acidic conditions (K = 5 × 10 5 M -1 ). 387 Interestingly, for the latter species, and based on molecular dynamic simulations, it was suggested that the binding of multiple dye molecules to pectin promoted their alignment along the polymer backbone. These adducts can be stabilized by ion pairs, hydrogen bonds and dispersive dyepectin interactions and by π-π interactions between adjacent dye molecules. 387 However, despite the higher affinity of the macromolecule for the flavylium cation, no changes were observed in the equilibrium constants of the flavylium reaction network in the presence of pectin. As suggested by Fernandes et al. and Dangles and Fenger, this unexpected behavior may eventually be assigned to the concentration effects used in the different experiments. 31,387 In order to fully clarify the (non)effect of pectin in the anthocyanin equilibrium constants, further systematic studies are probably required.</p>
        <p>Four citrus pectic fractions were investigated to evaluate the effect of the type and degree of pectin esterification on its interactions with cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 388 The ITC data obtained at pH 3.4 showed that the binding affinity is higher for the polysaccharides with a low degree of methyl esterification (K varies from 4.2 × 10 3 to 2.5 × 10 4 M -1 ), while for polymers with a higher degree of methyl esterification values from K = 6.2 × 10 2 to K = 1.3 × 10 3 M -1 were reported. The results suggest that polymers with higher contents of free carboxyl groups display higher affinity as a result of possible ionic interactions with the positively charged flavylium. In all cases, both the entropy and enthalpy changes were favorable, given that the association process was mostly controlled by entropy, probably due to the desolvation phenomena associated with the hydrophobic effect and ionic interactions. 1 H NMR titrations retrieved binding constants comparable with those obtained by ITC and, importantly, provided further evidence that the flavylium cation is the primary species interacting with the pectin polymers. In a recent study, grape skin pectic polysaccharides were found to improve the thermal stability of malvidin-3-glucoside in model solutions at slightly acidic pH values. The authors concluded that the establishment of ion-pair complexes between cationic flavylium species and negatively charged galacturonic acid residues of pectin fractions is the primary driving force responsible for the interaction and consequent increased thermostability from 60 to 80 °C. 389 Pectin polymers can also be explored to stabilize blue anthocyanin metal complexes. Kammerer et al. showed that anthocyanins carrying a catechol or pyrogallol moiety in the Bring form complexes with metal ions present in pectins enriched with aluminum and ferric cations. 390 These blue-colored complexes are stabilized by pectic structures that prevent precipitation.</p>
        <p>Other ionic polysaccharides such as chondroitin sulfate and dextran sulfate were also found to interact with the anthocyanins' flavylium cations, leading to hyperchromic effects under moderately acidic conditions. [391][392][393] The interaction of chondroitin sulfate with cyanidin-3-glucoside was shown to induce the formation of nanocomplexes (200-300 nm), which were suggested to contain stacks of cyanidin-3-glucoside within the aggregates (Scheme 49). 391 The formation of these nanostructured aggregates stabilized the anthocyanin flavylium and quinoidal species against degradation at pH values ranging from 3 to 12. Studies on ternary systems made from polyelectrolytes (chondroitin sulfate and chitosan), copigments, and anthocyanins showed synergistic effects for dye encapsulation, stabilization, and color quality, especially at pH values below 4. 394,395 The effects were attributed to the coencapsulation of anthocyanin and copigments within hydrophobic microenvironments provided by the polyelectrolyte capsules.</p>
        <p>Lignosulfonates are polyelectrolytes obtained from natural polymers (lignins) after the sulfite pulping method and during the manufacture of paper, and they are primarily used in the food industry and in cosmetics as encapsulating agents. The formation of complexes between malvidin-3-O-glucoside and lignosulfonate polymers was studied by UV-vis and stopped flow techniques. The addition of a lignosulfonate polymer to a solution of malvidin-3-O-glucoside at pH 1 produced spectral changes (red shift from 517 to 531 nm) that were used to obtain an apparent binding constant of K = 1.6 × 10 5 M -1 , indicating a strong interaction of the lignosulfonate macromolecule with the red flavylium cation. The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the malvidin-3-O-glucoside network of chemical reactions was investigated in detail, showing that the pK a , pK ^a, and pK′ a increased, leading to an extension of the pH domain of the red flavylium cation to higher pH values in the presence of this macromolecule and confirming the higher affinity of the negatively charged lignin to the cationic flavylium species (Figure 25). 396 The interaction of pyranoanthocyanins, such as bluish portisins and pyranoanthocyanin dimers, with lignosulfonates was also investigated. 397 This study demonstrated that the lignosulfonates induce the cooperative stacking of the dye at lower macromolecule concentrations due to the binding of several dyes to adjacent binding sites. It should be stressed that the polyelectrolyte-induced dye stacking is cooperative given that the observed binding constant for the association of the second and third dyes molecules to the same binding site occurs with higher affinity than the first.</p>
        <p>At higher polymer concentrations (and higher numbers of binding sites), this process becomes less likely to occur due to the reduced probability of binding two or more guest molecules to adjacent sites, leading to their redistribution over distant binding sites (Scheme 50). This process allows for color modulation and can significantly improve the water solubility and stability of the pigments over time (Figure 26).</p>
        <p>Peptides and proteins may also interact with anthocyanins. When studying the effect of aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine) and a polylysine, McClements and co-workers reported that the color of purple carrot anthocyanins is stabilized by these additives in model beverages containing citric acid and ascorbic acid at pH 3, with the higher effect observed in the case of tryptophan. 398 Dangles and Brouillard have determined an apparent binding constant of K = 65 M -1 for the interaction of this amino acid with malvin at pH = 3.5 which is both enthalpically and entropically favorable. 399 It should be also mentioned that in these studies no copigmentation interactions for phenylalanine and tyrosine with anthocyanin were observed.</p>
        <p>Carrier proteins such as human serum albumin (HSA), which is the most abundant protein in the plasma, may affect the transport of endogenous and exogenous ligands to tissues and their distribution into cells. 400 HSA is a 585-residue single polypeptide chain protein consisting of three α-helical domains numbered I-III, each of which contains two subdomains, A and B. Based on crystal structure analysis, it has been proposed that the primary HSA binding sites are in the hydrophobic cavities in subdomains IIA and IIIA. 401 The important role of this polypeptide as a ligand carrier in plasma has attracted the attention of different research groups that are investigating the binding of anthocyanins and other polyphenols with HSA. [402][403][404][405][406] Using fluorescence techniques, Gordon and Cahyana investigated the effect of the pH and the anthocyanin structure on the binding affinity toward HSA. 403 Four anthocyanidins (pelargonidin, cyanidin, delphinidin, and malvidin) and pelargonidin-3-glucoside were selected to investigate the associated phenomena by fluorescence spectros-copy over a pH range of 4-7.4. The authors reported a moderate variation in the association constants from K = 1.1 × 10 5 to K = 1.3 × 10 6 M -1 depending on the anthocyanin structure, pH, and temperature, which suggests that HSA binds all the ligands with comparable affinity levels. The binding affinities were observed to be generally higher at pH = 4 and were almost constant from 5 to 7.4. This trend can be attributed, on the one hand, to the appearance of higher fractions of quinoidal and ionized quinoidal bases at higher pH values and, on the other hand, to the increased hydrophobic character of HSA at pH = 4 (which is below the isoelectric point). This interpretation is supported by the fact that, at pH = 4, the binding affinity of the different ligands was observed to increase as their polarity decreases. By contrast, at pH = 7.4, the electrostatic interactions became more important and the aglycones tended to bind strongly to the HSA as the number of hydroxyl groups in the B ring increased. The same results were observed for the pelargonidin-3-glucoside, which also has a higher affinity for HSA than its aglycone counterpart at this pH. These results are consistent with those reported by Tang et al., who also observed an increase in the binding affinity with the number of hydroxyl groups in the B-ring at pH 7.4 for anthocyanin-3-glucosides. 406 These authors also performed site-specific competitive experiments to demonstrate that these anthocyanins primarily bind to subdomain IIA (site 1).</p>
        <p>The binding of synthetic 3-deoxyflavylium compounds with HSA has also been addressed. Dangles and co-workers observed that the trans-chalcones bind with slightly higher affinities to HSA than their respective quinoidal bases. Fluorescence titrations suggested that these compounds bind to or near subdomain IIA with association constants in the K = 1.8 × 10 4 -3.4 × 10 5 M -1 range. 407 Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside was used as a representative anthocyanin to investigate the binding properties of this class of compounds with three proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA), hemoglobin (Hb), and myoglobin (Mb). 408 The binding constants were obtained by fluorescence titrations, with values ranging from K = 8 × 10 3 to 7 × 10 4 M -1 at 298 K and pH = 7.4. BSA and Mb displayed similar affinities for the anthocyanin, while Hb had approximately 1 order of magnitude weaker affinity. The authors also used different spectroscopic techniques to observe evidence of alteration in the secondary structure of the proteins upon binding.</p>
        <p>Milk proteins, such as β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg), the most abundant protein in whey protein, have also attracted attention as potential targets that bind anthocyanins. Cyanidin nin 3-O-glucosides seems to suggest that, unlike HSA, this protein is highly selective. 409 This binding causes structural alterations in the protein, increasing β-sheets while reducing αhelixes. Malvidin-3-O-glucoside also binds to β-Lg but with a much weaker affinity of K = 6.7 × 10 2 M -1 . Nevertheless, it would be desirable to confirm and further explore this surprising binding selective by more accurate techniques such as ITC. 410 Despite its low affinity, the complexation of β-Lg was shown to improve the thermal-and photostability of the dye. A more recent study reported endothermic, entropy-driven interactions of β-Lg with delphinidin-3-O-glucoside with a K = 2.2 × 10 6 M -1 , which also imposed variations on the secondary structure of the protein. The structure-dependent binding affinity of β-Lg toward anthocyanin 3-O-glucosides suggests that, unlike HSA, this protein is highly selective. 411 Caseins are the primary proteins found in bovine milk, and they are important food sources of amino acids, carbohydrates, calcium, and phosphorus. The binding properties of αand βcasein toward malvidin-3-O-glucoside were investigated at pH 6.3 by Chen and co-workers, who showed that anthocyanin binds with a similar affinity to both proteins (K = 5 × 10 2 M -1 at 297 K). 412 Nevertheless, although the binding affinity was similar for the two proteins, the association of malvidin-3-Oglucoside with α-casein was enthalpy-driven, while in the case of β-casein the binding was endothermic and therefore entropydriven. The presence of casein was also found to improve the stability of the dye. Bouhallab and co-workers analyzed the effects of ionic strength and pH on the interaction of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside with sodium caseinate. 413 This class of proteins is present as soluble, self-assembled loose micelle-like aggregates of different unfolded caseins (α-, β-, and κ-casein variants in a 5:4:1 proportion) stabilized by weak noncovalent interactions and the hydrophobic effect.". 414 The formation of complexes between cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and sodium caseinate was evidenced by fluorescence and dynamic light scattering experiments at pH 2 and 7. For both pH values, two sets of binding sites were observed, with the first binding constant being 5-fold higher at pH 7 (K 1 = 5 × 10 6 M -1 vs K 1 = 1 × 10 6 M -1 at pH = 2) and the second binding constant being independent of the pH (K 2 = 3 × 10 5 M -1 ). The association process was found to be enthalpy-driven at a neutral pH, while at an acidic pH it is entropy-driven. It was also observed that, at pH = 7, the binding interactions were weakened by adding NaCl, while under acidic conditions the affinity remained practically unaffected by the ionic strength. The authors suggested that hydrophobic effects may be dominant at lower pH values, while at a neutral pH electrostatic interactions are more important. However, considering the complexity of the system, the authors acknowledged that an accurate interpretation of the binding parameters would require further studies. Unfortunately, most of these works largely ignore the structural transformations of anthocyanins as a function of pH (or even the chemical degradation of their aglycones under the conditions used) and do not specify the impact of the proteins on the color.</p>
        <p>In addition to color, anthocyanins and their derivatives are thought to influence other sensory properties in foods, such as bitterness and astringency sensations. Astringency is said to be due to the interaction of polyphenols with salivary proteins in the oral cavity, particularly in proline-rich proteins (PRPs). 415 These sensory phenomena have motivated investigations on the recognition properties of PRPs toward anthocyanins at a molecular level through different techniques, such as saturation transfer difference NMR, fluorescence quenching, mass spectrometry, and HPLC. [416][417][418] Acid PRP (aPRP), for which the N-terminal domain is dominated by negatively charged amino acids, was found to recognize both the hemiketal (K = 5.2 × 10 2 M -1 ) and the flavylium (K = 5.5 × 10 2 M -1 ) forms of malvidin-3-glucoside with similar affinity levels. 416 Moreover, the simultaneous presence of malvidin-3-glucoside and epicatechin was observed to display synergism in their interactions with salivary proteins, in particular, with aPRPs. 417 Pyranoanthocyanins were also observed to interact with aPRP. 419 Unlike common anthocyanins, these dyes are primarily present in their colored flavylium and quinoidal base forms. At pH = 3, pyranomalvidin-3-glucoside showed a moderate binding constant for aPRP (K = 5.74 × 10 2 M -1 ) that increased for the pyranomalvidin-3-glucoside-epicatechin (K = 1.15 × 10 3 M -1 ) due to the presence of the flavanol unit. Regarding bitterness, using a model based on taste receptors expressed individually in HEK293T cells, Soares and co-workers have shown that malvidin-3-glucoside interacts specifically with the receptor TAS2R7 (from 25 existing human receptors), showing an EC 50 = 12.6 mM. Because these experiments were performed at pH 7.4, the predominant species were the hemiketal and quinoidal base. However, the available data regarding the interactions of anthocyanin compounds with salivary proteins is still very scarce, and further research is still needed.</p>
        <p>Dendrimers are synthetic treelike macromolecules composed of repetitive layers of branching units that emerge from a central core. Their large functional surface, globular architecture at the nanometer scale, and inherent multivalency make them ideal candidates for a wide range of applications, from bio-and nanotechnology to catalysis and materials science. 420,421 Despite the great potential of dendrimer applications for the color and chemical stability of anthocyanins, these studies are scarce in the literature. Only a recent study reported the use of silica-PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles to encapsulate anthocyanins and to evaluate their antiproliferative activity against neuroblastoma (Neuro 2A). 422 The interaction between a gallic acid triethylene glycol based polyanionic dendrimer decorated with 162 sulfate groups with cyanidin-3-glucoside and malvidin-3-glucoside was investigated by UV-vis, stopped-flow, and NMR techniques. The study concluded that the dendrimer established stronger interactions with cyanidin-3-glucoside and exerted a strong stabilization effect on its color, increasing the pH domain of the flavylium cation by approximately one pH unit. 423 It was verified that the red flavylium cation is strongly shielded by the host due to the formation of ionic pairs, indicating the binding of approximately two anthocyanin molecules by each sulfate group (n ∼ 295) and with an association constant of K ∼ 700 M -1 per binding site, which implies an effective binding constant of nK = 2.1 × 10 5 M -1 (Figure 27). 423 It is worth noting that the apparent binding constant is comparable with the one obtained for the lignosulfonate polymer consisting of approximately 200 sulfonate groups per molecule. This is a value that underlines the efficiency of multivalent ionic interactions in the stabilization of cationic dyes.</p>
        <p>The studies reported in the literature on the interactions between anthocyanins and related compounds with polymers have assisted in the development of pH-responsive materials (films, membranes, and nanoparticles) for food packaging applications. In recent years, several studies have reported the Chemical Reviews pubs.acs.org/CR Review use of anthocyanin-rich plant extracts for developing colorimetric smart films for food-packaging applications such as pH and temperature indicators (sensors) for monitoring food freshness and spoilage at early stages. These approaches include the immobilization/encapsulation of anthocyanin-rich plant extracts (e.g., red cabbage, purple sweet potatoes, tomato) in biocompatible polymers (chitosan, pectin, starch, cellulose, and agar) to monitor color variations in food products, especially milk, fish, seafood, and meat. [424][425][426][427][428][429][430][431][432][433][434][435] 8. DEGRADATION OF ANTHOCYANINS AND RELATED COMPOUNDS In anthocyanins and related multistate compounds, it is necessary to distinguish between (i) reversible reactions that take place upon exposure to external stimuli such as pH and light; (ii) irreversible reactivity with other compounds, for example, those present in food matrixes such as wine, which in most cases lead to the production of other compounds in which the benzopyrylium group is still present; and (iii) irreversible decomposition reactions (related to storage stability) that break the molecule into fragments. Item (i) was discussed in sections 3 and 4 of this Review, item (ii) was discussed in section 2, and some of this information was recently reviewed. 31 In this section, we focus on item (iii). The clear distinction between reversible (water addition) and irreversible (autoxidation) components of color loss, especially around neutrality when both processes contribute to fading, was recently reported for red cabbage anthocyanins. 436 The mechanisms involved in the anthocyanin degradation that occurs in biological systems "in vivo" or in solution "in are different, because in plants active enzyme-driven breakdown processes are involved, as also reviewed in this section. In both cases, oxygen and its reduced species play a crucial role and will be reviewed in this section.</p>
        <p>The term "stabilization" as used in anthocyanin's literature can have two different meanings, leading to possible misunderstandings: (i) resistance to hydration, which means the extension of the pH domain of the flavylium cation and quinoidal base (and its anionic form) when the bases are accompanied by an increase in their color expression; (ii) decrease of degradation in relation to their storage stability. 202 There is a large number of studies in the literature that highlight the influence of structural factors on the radical scavenging activity of anthocyanins but only a few that relate their chemical stability and degradation with structural features. Scheme 51 summarizes the mains products identified resulting from the oxidative breakage of the anthocyanin structure.</p>
        <p>The nature of the substituents in position 3 of the flavylium cation has long been associated with degradation. 203 In fact, the decomposition rate decreases dramatically from anthocyanidins to anthocyanins and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins. 202 Moreover, early studies concluded that anthocyanins with a higher hydroxylation degree are less stable while those with a higher methoxylation degree increase the storage stability. The stability of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins has been less studied. Some of the studies on this subject associate the stability of 3deoxyanthocyanidins with the extended pH domain of the flavylium cation and not to its degradation processes. A study on the effect of storage time and temperature on phenolic compounds of sorghum grain and flour (including the 3deoxyanthocyanidins luteolinidin and apigeninidin) showed that the color of the samples remained stable for 120 days. 440 The thermodynamics and kinetics of cyanidin (aglycone) were studied by direct and reverse pH jumps. 441 The pH dependence of the flavylium cation decomposition follows a bell-shaped curve, without reversibility, as shown in Figure 28a and Scheme 52. In the ascending branch the bell-shaped curve, the increase in the decomposition rate can be explained by the increase in the chalcone availability to decompose. The decreasing branch of this curve results from the fact that the rate of the hydration reaction decreases with increasing pH. This branch of the curve is controlled by the hydration reaction that retards the formation of Cc and Ct. Even if the degradation of the chalcones is very fast, it is not faster than the rate of the hydration reaction. In kinetic terms, it is similar to the bellshaped curve already described in section 3 but, instead of the pH-reversible isomerization, is a nonreversible kinetics leading to the fragmentation of the chalcone, as shown in Scheme 52.</p>
        <p>The confirmation of the fast degradation rate is given in Figure 28b. The following sequence of direct and reverse pH jumps was performed: (i) a direct pH jump from a solution of cyanidin at pH = 0.8 to pH = 4.6, (ii) remaining at this pH for 1 min (delay), (iii) followed by a reverse pH jump back to the same (or very close) pH. In the experiment shown in Figure 28b, only 63% of the flavylium cation was recovered. In an identical experiment with a 20 min delay at pH = 4.6, practically no flavylium recovery was observed.</p>
        <p>The degradation of cyanidin at pH = 2.8 is much slower and the respective kinetics can be followed by HPLC, as shown in Figure 29a. The flavylium cation disappears, giving rise to the chalcone and some degradation products. Indeed it was observed the formation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid from ring B and 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzaldehyde from ring A, together with 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid from the oxidation of the respective benzaldehyde during a second stage, consistent with previous results and shown in Figure 29b. 442 Noteworthy, the thermal degradation pattern (the products, not the respective rate) of other anthocyanidins (aglycone) pelargonidin, cyanidin, delphinidin, and malvidin at room temperature and under acidic to moderately acidic conditions is similar. 442 As previously mentioned, under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4, 37 °C), anthocyanidins degrade to phenolic acids and aldehydes at much higher rates than their glucoside counterparts, especially those with a higher level of B-ring hydroxylation. 443 That mechanisms involved are probably different especially if the glucose moiety is still linked to the structure. A possible explanation for the degradation of anthocyanins at acidic pH is shown in Scheme 53 involving main steps: (i) hydrolysis promoting deglycosylation of position 3 (ratedeterming step) and (ii) autoxidation and degradation (breakage) of the electron-rich chalcone aglycone form.</p>
        <p>Regarding acylated anthocyanins, acylation extends the pH domain of the colored species, stabilizing the color, (see section 4.4 of this Review) but some studies stressed that acylation also increases the thermal degradation rate, in particular, at higher pH values. 240,436 This apparent paradox was highlighted by Dangles and co-workers in an extensive study about the color stability and degradation of acylated anthocyanins of red cabbage (Scheme 54). 444 These authors have followed the kinetics of color loss of these pigments at pH = 7 (50 °C) for 8 h and have observed that the color stability increases with acylation. However, by measuring the red flavylium ion resulting from the fast conversion of all reversible forms (except trans-chalcones) by reverse pH jump back to pH = 1.0-1.5, they observed a higher irreversible degradation of the acylated anthocyanins compared to anthocyanins nonacylated (PA). After 24 h, the percentage of residual flavylium cation lies within a range from 40 to 60% and is mostly independent of the acylation pattern. The degradation products consisted of new pigments (isomers, deacylation, and intramolecular acyl transfer) and products from the oxidative degradation. At intermediate and advanced thermal degradation, oxidative mechanisms led to degradation products; some of them shown in Schemes 51 and 53.</p>
        <p>It should be mentioned that acylated anthocyanins around the neutral pH have a high molar fraction of quinoidal base and its anionic quinoidal base at the equilibrium, which are probably more prone to degradation. While it is well-known after the work of Brouillard and Dubois 184 that the quinoidal base does not hydrate in moderately acidic medium, it has also reported that in Chemical Reviews pubs.acs.org/CR Review basic medium the anionic bases react very rapidly with OH -to give trans-chalcone and other final products. 445 As far as we know, this has never been proved for anthocyanins due to their high instability at basic conditions, but it was reported for other flavylium compounds such as 4′-aminoflavylium and 7-(N,Ndiethylamino)-4′-hydroxyflavylium after direct pH jumps to the basic region followed by stopped-flow (Figure 30). 446,447 Representation of the observed rate constant as a function of pH shows at lower pHs a decrease of the rate as expected from eq 5 (section 3), followed at higher pH by a monoexponential rise directly proportional to [OH -]. In basic medium, the pseudoequilibrium and equilibrium species were identified as cis-and trans-chalcones or their deprotonated forms, depending on the final pH. In consequence, degradation in basic medium is expected to occur for the chalcones. 179 Also, the stability of the flavylium multistate species increases dramatically upon O-glycosylation or O-methylation of anthocyanidins at position 3. The former strategy (with glucose or other sugars) is used by nature to confer stability to anthocyanins at slightly acidic or neutral pH values. It is noteworthy that the isolation and characterization of two 3-Omethylated anthocyanins from mauve flowers of Erlangea tomentosa (Bothriocline longipes) was achieved by Andersen and co-workers, 448 as shown in Scheme 55. No detailed information is given regarding the stability of this anthocyanin, but during extraction, isolation and storage in acidified methanolic solvents both anthocyanins were partly converted to their demalonylated and methylmalonyl esterified forms.</p>
        <p>The stability of cyanidin, its 3-O-glucoside derivative, and the model compound 3-O-methylcyanidin was studied by Yoshida and co-workers. 438 In aqueous solution at pH = 1.0, the percentages of flavylium cation of these three species after 20 days in the dark were 5%, 90%, and 97%, respectively.</p>
        <p>Thermogravimetric analysis of cyanidin-3-glucoside has shown that the first step toward the decomposition of the anthocyanin, which occurred from 30 to 200 °C, corresponds to the cleavage of the glucose yielding the aglycone. 449 The results reported above have been corroborated by other studies the degradation of anthocyanins at high temperatures (from 60 to 95 °C). 450,451,[451][452][453] In summary, the rates of these degradations are monoexponential, with lifetimes ranging from approximately 1 to 5 h. The degradation rate increases with the increase of temperature and pH (up to pH = 6).</p>
        <p>In general, liquid-phase reactions of organic substances with molecular oxygen have been reported to usually proceed by a free radical chain mechanism. 454 These oxidations are of autocatalytic nature and are known as autoxidations. 455 In argon atmosphere, the degradation rate of anthocyanins is reduced, showing that O 2 contributes to this process. 436 In spite of the experimental difficulties to calculate the standard redox potentials of anthocyanins, the data available in the literature 456 strongly suggests that the one electron oxidation to form superoxide is unlikely to occur with anthocyanins.</p>
        <p>These kinetic limitations are overcome when catalysts, for example, iron and copper ions or enzymes, are present. 31,457 While the preliminary formation of H 2 O 2 in the absence of catalysts remains unclear, 31 the oxidation by H 2 O 2 and the role of O 2 and Fe 2+ in the degradation mechanisms have been discussed. 31,457 It is common to find iron and copper ions in substantial concentrations in biological material such as plants and foods, free or bound to proteins. Thus, it is worth mentioning the role of these transition metal ions in the oxidative processes involving micronutrients such as phenols. In the case of substituted catechols, Nkhili and co-workers found experimental quantitative evidence for the formation of a metal complex involving catechol, Fe 2+ , or Cu + and dioxygen at pH = 7.4. 458 It was shown that plant phenols are more easily oxidized with the concomitant formation of H 2 O 2 when bound to copper than to iron. Two different electron transfer mechanisms are proposed: In the case of Fe 2+ , the electron transfer takes place from the metal to the O 2 leading to hydrogen peroxide and the catechol complex with Fe 3+ ; for Cu + -induced autoxidation, the electron transfer occurs from the organic compound to O 2 mediated by Cu + leading to hydrogen peroxide and a complex mixture of oligomers.</p>
        <p>Alongside the direct oxidation of phenolics in metal-catalyzed oxidation, hydrogen peroxide has been described to have an important role in the direct chemical degradation of polyphenols.</p>
        <p>The oxidation of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside by hydrogen peroxide was investigated in a range of solvents. A plausible oxidation mechanism was proposed based on the resulting reaction products, and this mechanism was confirmed by HPLC-MS experiments using 18 O-labeled reagents, as shown in Scheme 56. 457 Scheme 55. Two Erlangidin Derivatives Reported by Andersen and Co-workers 448 It is noteworthy that, in water, the reactive species is the hemiketal, which could explain the experimentally observed increase of the degradation rate as the pH increases in the pH range of the pK′ a . The mono-oxygenation of the hemiketal (electrophilic addition of H 2 O 2 ) occurs at the 3-position owing to an electron donation from the phenolic hydroxyl group at the 7-position of the A-ring.</p>
        <p>The putative role of H 2 O 2 in the formation of a quinone methide derivative resulting from the oxidative degradation of maldivin-3-O-glucoside under acidic conditions was also observed in a wine model solution stored at 90 and 25 °C (see in Scheme 51, C2-C3 cleavage). 439 In conclusion, strong experimental evidence was obtained for at least two degradation steps for anthocyanins: (i) deglycosylation of position 3 of the anthocyanin, leading to unstable anthocyanidins, and (ii) oxidation by O 2 (autoxidation), probably involving radical intermediates. In this last process, the presence of traces of metal cations such as iron or copper leads to catalytic processes (e.g., Fenton reaction traces) that overcome the thermodynamic barriers and facilitate degradation. 444 Deglycosylation of position 3 was detected with flavylium cations (under acidic conditions) from thermogravimetry experiments. The resulting aglycone is very unstable (Figure 28) involving the fast autoxidation and degradation (breakage) of the chalcone form as proposed in Scheme 53. At pH values close to neutrality or higher, autoxidation of the electron-rich anionic base must occur first, followed by the hydrolysis of labile ester bonds (arylesters, glycosylesters) thus formed. This process may involve the concomitant production of H 2 O 2 and its fast subsequent reaction as an electrophile (Scheme 56).</p>
        <p>During autoxidation, H 2 O 2 is formed, which could react as an electrophile with the most nucleophilic anthocyanin forms (hemiketal, anionic base) or via the Fenton reaction (due to inevitable iron and/or traces). The formation of H 2 O 2 in complex biological media may involve many other substrates than anthocyanins. For instance, catechol moieties from other phenolics (e.g., catechins and caffeic acid derivatives) can undergo autoxidation (in the presence of metal traces), yielding O-semiquinones that, in turn and depending on their structure, can transfer one electron to molecular oxygen, yielding superoxide radical that in turn by dismutation give rise to the formation of H 2 O 2 . 459,460</p>
        <p>A transient accumulation of anthocyanins occur in some plants and fruits, appearing and disappearing during plant development, and also depending on the environmental conditions. 461 For instance, UV light and low temperatures promotes anthocyanin biosynthesis while high temperature induces its degradation. [462][463][464][465] It was postulated that since anthocyanins absorb visible and UV light, their accumulation in young leaves may serve as a "sunscreen", protecting the photosynthetic apparatus of the plants. On the other hand, their antioxidant properties may also confer protection to plant cells against oxidative damage. 466,467 There are some examples of anthocyanin degradation in flowers such as Brunfelsia calycina (Solanaceae) and petunia mutants whose petal color faded after flower opening. 468,469 In fruits such as eggplants, peppers, tomatoes, blood oranges, and litchis, the concentration of anthocyanins increases during ripening, reaching a maximum and declining at later stages of maturity. [470][471][472] In general, the type of color hue and intensity are important sensorial quality parameters that attract consumers. Despite the economic interests of the food industry, there are very few studies in the literature addressing the mechanisms behind this transient accumulation of anthocyanins. In some plants, there is evidence of simultaneous anthocyanin accumulation and degradation (turnover effect). In other cases, these compounds are synthesized and remain stable in the plant vacuole, at least until cell degradation.</p>
        <p>Anthocyanin degradation and its consequent discoloration may occur in vivo as a result of active enzyme-driven breakdown processes such as by anthocyanase (anthocyanin-glucosidase), polyphenoloxidases (PPO), and peroxidases (POD). These enzymes hydrolyze and oxidize anthocyanins and are primarily active during fruit senescence and later in processed food. During food processing and storage, cell-wall degradation occurs, leading to an intracellular decompartmentalization and setting the conditions for anthocyanin exposure to enzymes that, at least originally in plant cells, are located in different compartments.</p>
        <p>Oren-Shamir has clearly summarized three alternative pathways for the enzymatic degradation of anthocyanins and tissue browning: 461 (2) a coupled (indirect) oxidation, i.e., a reduction of the quinones of phenolic compounds (formed previously through the action of PPO) to the original phenolic compounds (major PPO substrates such as caffeic acid derivatives) in parallel to the oxidation of anthocyanin to anthocyanin quinone, which might be thermodynamically feasible, depending on the kinetic constrains. Direct enzymatic oxidation of anthocyanins promoted by PPO is not expected to occur since anthocyanins are poor substrates for that enzyme; and (3) anthocyanin may also be directly oxidized by peroxidase in the presence of H 2 O 2 (Figure 31). In processed food, this complex enzymatic system leading to the formation of quinones involved in coupled oxidation and direct chemical reactions (e.g., Michael addition) could be responsible for a faster anthocyanin degradation (essentially present in their hemiketal, chalcone, and base forms) and also in browning processes involving the reaction of quinones with other substrates (proteins, carbohydrates, polyphenols, etc.). The catalytic cycle of peroxidases 473 and phenol oxidase 474 showing the events (oxidation-reduction) is described in Figure 32.</p>
        <p>Polyphenol oxidase is a copper(II)-containing oxidoreductase. This enzyme could be inhibited by using copper chelating agents such as organic acids (citric acid, oxalic acid, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), sodium pyrophosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate, and ascorbate, and also by decreasing the pH to below 4.0. As an example, oxalic and citric acids have been used in fruit juice to delay anthocyanin degradation probably by inhibiting of the formation of quinones involved in the coupled oxidation of anthocyanins as described in Figure 31. 475 Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) play a major role in these catalytic processes and its presence in tissues may have different origins. H 2 O 2 and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during a number of cellular events through enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions. [476][477][478] On the other hand, during cellular respiration, a complex series of mitochondrial electrontransfer reactions occurs, promoting the one-to three-electron reduction of oxygen to form different ROS species, namely, O 2</p>
        <p>•-, H 2 O 2 , and the hydroxyl radical (HO • ).</p>
        <p>Some of these reduced species of oxygen are highly reactive and capable of directly oxidizing various cellular components and different compounds. These species can react with some forms of anthocyanins, initiating their irreversible degradation and yielding the final products from the C1′-C2, C2-C3, and C3-C4 cleavage from Scheme 51, as described by Dangles and Fenger. 31,457 9. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK The flavylium multistate is intrinsically complex due to the large number of species that are reversibly interconnected by external stimuli, such as pH, light, and heat. However, the system is dramatically simplified when the flavylium cation is considered as a polyprotic acid in equilibrium with its conjugated base, CB, which is the sum of the quinoidal base, hemiketal, cis-and transchalcone, and their respective anionic species, including CB -, CB 2-, etc. This perspective is the starting point for developing the mathematical expressions reported throughout this review.</p>
        <p>The study of the thermodynamic and kinetics of flavyliumbased dyes is indispensable not only to rationalize their degradation mechanisms and the in vitro and in vivo color expression problem but also to rationalize their application as food colorants, functional ingredients, and dietary supplements [479][480][481][482] as well as in more emergent areas, such as in the design of new photochromic systems, stimuli-responsive smart materials, and supramolecular devices. 178 The use of anthocyanins as food/beverage additives is allowed within Europe (E163), Japan, and the United States, among other countries. 483 Nevertheless, the application of anthocyanins as colorants is limited by the pH of the food and the possibility of their chemical reaction with other molecules or ions. 31 A top priority of the food industry regarding food colorants is to search for blue pigments that are stable over a wide pH range. This stability would allow these pigments to be used in foods to replace synthetic blue dyes that are no longer allowed in the food industry. The only natural source of blue pigments used in foods is phycocyanin from the blue alga Spirulina, but its production is somewhat expensive, increasing the cost of the final product. Thus, one of the biggest challenges in the food industry is the stabilization of blue quinoidal bases of anthocyanins at neutral and slightly acidic pH values. The colors of anthocyanins, particularly the more acylated ones, can be modulated according to the pH during food processing. A recent example was described by Appelhagen et al. in an experiment to produce cupcakes decorated with icing sugar with different colors. These authors supplemented icing sugar with anthocyanin extracts produced from mutant Arabidopsis cell cultures. 50 More recently, an anthocyanin-based cyan blue previously discovered as a minor component in red cabbage was characterized. 175 Interestingly, this minor monoacylated anthocyanin bearing a sinapoyl group on Glc-2 of the sophorose moiety (3-O-(2-O-(2-O-(E)-sinapoyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-5-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-cyanidin) was found to have a particularly high λ max of 640 nm at pH 7. This compound in the presence of Al 3+ is described to form a blue colored trimeric complex Al 3+ (P2-) 3 with a large bathochromic shift of &gt;40 nm. These chromatic properties make this blue pigment P2 a strong candidate for food applications free or complexed with metals. In order to increase the production of this pigment, an E. coli codon-optimized gene encoding hydrolytic enzymes was developed by synthetic biology to produce a specific and highly selective catalytic diacylation enzyme. The enzyme was shown to selectively remove any acyl group bound to Glc-1 of the sophorose moiety while leaving the sinapoyl group on Glc-2 intact, thus converting polyacylated anthocyanins into the pigment of interest.</p>
        <p>Another use of both the coloring and antioxidant properties of anthocyanins and their derivatives concerns hair coloring and cosmetic dermatological products. [484][485][486][487] Toxicological studies have revealed that anthocyanins are not harmful to human health 488 and have shown beneficial effects, [489][490][491] thus making them a sustainable, advantageous alternative to many current synthetic and toxic hair dyes. Blackburn, Rayner, and co-workers have developed a natural hair dye made from anthocyanins extracted from waste blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) fruit skins. Intense blue-colored dye on hair could be achieved with a λ max at 580 nm, typical of the anionic quinoidal base. Hair has been suggested as being able to provide an environment that enables the stabilization of the anionic quinoidal base upon adsorption through association with cations in hair and copigmentation effects. 492 In addition, the use of anthocyanins as viable alternatives to synthetic lipstick colorants was studied by Westfall and co-workers. 493,494 The incorporation of anthocyanin extracts into the matrix of lipstick formulations proved to be stable, even under the accelerated environmental testing used to predict a shelf life of at least 2 years. Sources containing both nonacylated cyanidin-based and acylated cyanidin-based anthocyanins, such as those from elderberries, purple corn, and purple sweet potatoes, were shown to have the greatest stability compared with purple carrot, red grape, and red radish formulas. More recently, Giusti et al., 494 confirmed that anthocyanins incorporated into lipstick formulations maintain their biological activity as antioxidants through the scavenging of free radicals and function as filters for UV light, especially anthocyanins with cinnamic acid acylation.</p>
        <p>The ubiquity of the anthocyanin multistate of species in other families of compounds is in some way surprising. Plants in different positions of the evolutionary tree, from liverworts, mosses, and ferns to angiosperm, use different flavylium cations, auronidins (furanoflavylium), 3-deoxyanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins to confer color. While the colors and the interconversion rates are different, the reactions of the multistate are the same: proton transfer, hydration, tautomerization, and isomerization.</p>
        <p>A great deal of progress has been made regarding the reactivity of different multistate species in recent years. Knowledge of the degradation of anthocyanins, while not yet completely understood, in particular, the way in which autoxidation processes are triggered, has advanced. There is, however, one intrinsic contradiction regarding anthocyanin stability. The antioxidant properties of anthocyanins are related to their ability to easily oxidize by donating electrons to ROS species. This action is not compatible with a strong storage stability toward the autoxidation processes needed for their applications as food colorants, for example. In these cases, mixtures of anthocyanins Chemical Reviews pubs.acs.org/CR Review with or without the presence of copigments would be worthwhile. Despite the fact that acylated anthocyanins possess higher chemical stability than nonacylated ones, they are still not sufficiently stable for industrial applications. Encapsulation in biocompatible matrixes of these and other anthocyanins could be a challenge for future studies, and some studies in this direction have already appeared in the literature.</p>
        <p>The strategies developed by nature to fix the colors of anthocyanins, namely, supramolecular structures involving metals, intra-and intermolecular interactions, and the role of acylated anthocyanins, have been rationalized and used to design bioinspired systems. The photodegradation of anthocyanins is another field that requires further investigation. The information collected on the in vitro anthocyanin properties is the basis for further technological studies and human trials. It is expected that these types of studies will increase in the future. Understanding anthocyanin behavior in plant vacuoles will pose many interesting theoretical instrumental challenges.</p>
