        <p>Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) are well knownf or their ability to activate small molecules.R ecent reports of radical formation within such systems indicate single-electron transfer (SET) could play an important role in their chemistry. Herein, we investigate radical formation upon reacting FLP systems with dihydrogen, triphenyltin hydride,o rt etrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone (TCQ) both experimentally and computationally to determine the nature of the single-electron transfer (SET) events;that is,being direct SET to B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 or not. The reactions of H 2 and Ph 3 SnH with archetypal P/B FLP systems do not proceed via ar adical mechanism. In contrast, reaction with TCQ proceeds via SET,w hichi so nly feasible by Lewis acid coordination to the substrate.Furthermore,SET from the Lewis base to the Lewis acid-substrate adduct may be prevalent in other reported examples of radical FLP chemistry, which provides important design principles for radical maingroup chemistry.</p>
        <p>Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) combine aL ewis acidic electron-pair acceptor and aL ewis basic electron-pair donor to activate small molecules,m ost notably H 2 and CO 2 , granting access to fascinating main group chemistry and catalysis. [1] It is generally accepted that the FLP components cooperatively interact with the substrate to facilitate heterolytic bond cleavage; [2] however,r ecent reports suggest that radicals may play an important role too and, in some cases, provide alternative homolytic pathways. [2b,c,3] Stephan et al. reported the detection of aw eak radical signal by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy for the archetypal FLP PMes 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 (Mes = 2,4,6-triphenylmethyl), and after switching the Lewis acid to Al(C 6 F 5 ) 3 found as imilar, yet much clearer,E PR signal that could be unambiguously attributed to the phosphine radical cation (PMes 3 C + ). [2c] Furthermore,r eaction of PMes 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 with Ph 3 SnH resulted in formation of [Mes 3 PH][HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]a nd Ph 3 SnSnPh 3 ,i nstead of the [Mes 3 P-SnPh 3 ][HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]p roduct that would be expected for heterolytic cleavage of the SnÀ Hbond. [2c] In the case of PtBu 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ,for which no radicals were detected in the reaction mixture,indeed [tBu 3 P-SnPh 3 ]-[HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]w as obtained, corresponding to nucleophilic substitution at tin (Scheme 1a). As the difference in products was proposed to be caused by ac hange in mechanism (homolytic vs.h eterolytic), this led to the use of Ph 3 SnH as ap robe for determining the mechanistic nature of FLP reactions. [2c, 4] (TCQ) leads to radical formation after observation of PMes 3 C + by EPR spectroscopy (Scheme 1b). [2c, 5] Furthermore,M elen et al. recently reported that the PMes 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 pair can be utilized to facilitate C À Cb ond formation by coupling diarylmethyl groups to styrenes via amechanism involving singleelectron transfer (SET;Scheme 1c). [6] Ooi et al. also achieved CÀCb ond formation using an amine/B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 system to couple methylvinylketone to the amine employing catalytic amounts of borane (Scheme 1d). [7] They also showed that the reaction requires light and proceeds via radical species which they postulated to be the result of photo-induced SET from the amine directly to B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 yielding the corresponding radical ion pair [amineC + ,B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À ]. Subsequent addition of this species to the substrate was proposed, which then led to product formation.</p>
        <p>Recently,wedemonstrated the generality of SET for FLP type donor-acceptor systems [8,9] and showed that for common P/B FLPs (PMes 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 and PtBu 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 )a nd analogous N/B systems visible light is required to induce SET to generate the corresponding transient radical ion pairs (Scheme 1e). [10] This light dependence provides an excellent probe for determining whether an FLP reaction proceeds via ar adical mechanism or via concerted, polar pathways,a s carrying out the reaction in the absence of light precludes the formation of the radical ion pair. Thework presented herein focuses on applying this notion to investigate the reaction of archetypal FLPs with the substrates H 2 ,Ph 3 SnH and TCQ.In addition, we analyzed the nature of the initial single-electron transfer event that is responsible for the radical chemistry observed by Melen et al. and Ooi et al. Fora ll cases,w e determine whether the boron Lewis acid is directly involved in SET,orplays afacilitating role by enhancing the oxidizing power of the substrate. [11]</p>
        <p>First, we assessed the influence of light on the reaction of PMes 3 and B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 with H 2 (1 atm), which is known to generate the corresponding phosphonium borate [Mes 3 PH]-[HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]. [12] We previously showed that this combination of donor (PMes 3 )a nd acceptor (B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 )f orms av iolet charge-transfer complex in solution from which the corresponding radical ion pair [PMes 3 C + ,B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À ]isgenerated by irradiating this electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex with visible light (534 nm). [10] Thus,ifformation of this radical ion pair is asignificantly contributing factor in hydrogen splitting, the reaction should exhibit achange in reaction rate depending on the absence or presence of light. Comparison of reaction samples kept in the dark or irradiated (534 nm, 2.2 W LEDs;S cheme 2) whilst stirring for 2.5 hours showed nearidentical conversions to the phosphonium borate [Mes 3 PH]-[HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ], and again after 4hours,a sd etermined by 31 P-NMR spectroscopy (Supporting Information, Figures S1,S2). [13] These data show that the reaction is not light dependent and therefore the formation of the radical ion pair does not significantly influence the reaction kinetics.This finding suggests that the photo-stationary concentration of the radical ion pair [PMes 3 C + ,B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À ]istoo low and/or its lifetime is too short to significantly influence the reaction rate. Indeed, this charge-separated state lies much higher in energy (54.4 kcal mol À1 )than the neutral donor-acceptor pair [PMes 3 , B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]a nd undergoes rapid back-electron transfer (lifetime = 237 ps) as determined by transient absorption spectroscopy to regenerate the FLP, [10] thus preventing build-up of ac oncentration of radicals large enough to influence the reaction kinetics.This leads to the conclusion that the splitting of dihydrogen by PMes 3 and B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 proceeds via at woelectron, heterolytic pathway,e ven when the reaction is performed in ambient light. [2e-g] Next, we probed the reaction between PMes 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 and Ph 3 SnH ( 2 S10), supporting the observations by Stephan et al. [2c] We noted, however, that when more Ph 3 SnH (up to 2.5 equiv) was used, the reaction continued and after 20 hours [tBu 3 PH][HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]( d 31 P = 58.1, 1 J P-H = 410 Hz;S upporting Information, Figure S12) as well as Ph 3 Sn-SnPh 3 (Scheme 3; Supporting Information, Figure S14) was observed. [13] We also noted that this reaction proceeds equally in the absence of light, in ambient light, or under direct irradiation of the charge-transfer band of [PtBu 3 , B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ](400 nm, 2.2 WLED). These findings show that for both phosphines R 3 P( R= Mes and tBu) ap olar, heterolytic mechanism is operative and that the initial product [R 3 P-SnPh 3 ][HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]c an convert into [R 3 PH][HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]i n the presence of Ph 3 SnH.</p>
        <p>To elucidate the heterolytic splitting of Ph 3 SnH in more detail, we first combined it with B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 in calculations and found the formation of an adduct with ab ridging hydride [Ph 3 SnÀHÀB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]( DE = À21.3, DG8 8 298K = À1.9 kcal mol À1 ;F igure 1, left), which is analogous to the key,transient intermediate in the B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 -catalyzed hydrosilylation. [14] We also observed the [Ph 3 Sn À H À B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]a dduct in C 6 H 5 Cl solution by 19 F-NMR spectroscopy that shows ad ecrease in resonance difference between the meta-a nd para-fluorines (Dd 18.2 to 13.7 ppm), which is indicative of atransition from at rigonal planar borane to am ore tetrahedral geometry. [15] Furthermore, 119 Sn-NMR spectroscopy supports this notion, the clear downfield shift indicates am ore electron deficient Sn nucleus (d = 165 to 130 ppm;S upporting Information, Figure S15, S16). [16] These observations evidence activation of the tin hydride by B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ,m aking it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by ap hosphine in an S N 2f ashion to produce the initial [R 3 P-SnPh 3 ][HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ]s pecies.</p>
        <p>To investigate the subsequent reaction steps and determine the influence of the P-substituent (Mes vs. tBu), we again employed computational chemistry (wB97X-D/def2-TZVP;[ HB(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ] À anion omitted), [15] which highlighted aformal metathesis reaction of the [R 3 PÀSnPh 3 ] + cation with Ph 3 SnÀH, reminiscent of reactions between tin hydrides and neutral stannyl phosphines. [17] When using PMes 3 (Figure 2, in green), [Mes 3 P-SnPh 3 ] + undergoes af acile reaction with Ph 3 SnH to afford the bridging hydride [Ph 3 Sn À H À SnPh 3 ] + (DE °TS1 % 9, DE = À4.9 kcal mol À1 ), [15] akin to the tin hydride-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 adduct (Figure 1 To support the intermediacyo ft he bridging [Ph 3 SnÀHÀ SnPh 3 ] + cation, we combined [Ph 3 C][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ]with 2equiv of Ph 3 SnH in C 6 H 5 Cl at À35 8 8Cinorder to access this species by hydride abstraction (Scheme 4). Indeed, after 1hour,t he characteristic yellow color of the trityl cation disappeared, and an expected downfield shift of the aromatic 1 Hn uclei of the Ph 3 Sn species in combination with ab roadening of the hydride peak at 6.91 ppm was observed by 1 HNMR spectroscopy (Supporting Information, Figures S20,S21). [15] In addition, the spectrum evidenced formation of triphenylmethane (d 1 H = 5.55). [18] As predicted by DFT,s ubsequent addition of PMes 3 led to formation of [Mes 3 PH][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ]by [2c] They postulated that this proceeds via SET from PMes 3 to B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 to form the corresponding radical ion pair [PMes 3 C + ,B (C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À ], after which 2equiv of B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À react with the quinone to form dianion 7,w hile 1equiv of B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À affords the neutral adduct Mes 3 P-TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 4 (Scheme 5). [2c] We performed this reaction in the absence of light and found that the reaction still proceeds rapidly, forming ad eep purple solution for which EPR spectroscopy confirmed the formation of PMes 3 C + (two-line signal simulated with g iso = 2.0050, A iso = 670.00 MHz), [2c, 19] but also showed for the first time af eatureless signal (g iso = 2.0058) that we attribute to aTCQ centered radical anion, most likely TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À (Figure 3). Furthermore,w en oted an unknown smaller third signal, which was also reported by Müller and Klare et al. when combining PMes 3 and the strongly accepting silyl and trityl cations. [20,21] So,how is it possible that radicals are formed in the dark? Clearly,astrong electron acceptor is required to oxidise PMes 3 (IE D = 5.25 eV; SCRF [15] /wB97X-D/6-311 + G(d,p), solvent = chlorobenzene) and neither B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 nor TCQ are suitable (E A = 3.31 and 4.45 eV,respectively) [15] to accommodate the needed thermal SET.Y et, B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 can coordinate to one of the carbonyl moieties of TCQ,a ffording the corresponding Lewis adduct TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ,w hich has an increased electron affinity (E A = 5.57 eV) and therefore should be capable of oxidizing PMes 3 . [11] Note that such interactions between aL ewis acid and ac arbonyl moiety are typically exploited in photo-redox catalysis to facilitate SET events. [22] As the carbonyl moieties of TCQ are electron poor,t he interaction with B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 is weak (DE = À4.6, DG8 8 298K = 10.7 kcal mol À1 )l eading to an equilibrium featuring low concentrations of the TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 adduct, which supports the notion of Stephan et al. that no interaction between B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 and TCQ is observable by NMR spectroscopy. [2c] However,i np resence of PMes 3 ,t he transient TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 adduct will undergo SET from the PMes 3 HOMO to the TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 LUMO (Scheme 5, left) generating the radical ion pair [PMes 3 C + ,T CQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À ] 3,w hich drives the equilibrium towards the TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 adduct (Scheme 5b, blue). Subsequent radical coupling of PMes 3 C + and TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À via acomputed 8kcal mol À1 (DG8 8 298 K )barrier leads to the formation of Mes 3 P-TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 4 as observed experimentally by Stephan et al. (Scheme 5b,b lack). [2c] This mechanism highlights that, rather than directly participating in SET,B (C 6 F 5 ) 3 is facilitating the process by increasing the electron affinity of the quinone acceptor.</p>
        <p>As TCQ features two carbonyl moieties,c oordination of two B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 molecules can also occur prior to SET ( 2 Changing the phosphine to PtBu 3 was shown by Stephan et al. to only yield the tBu 3 P À TCQ À B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 adduct, akin to 4,w ithout detectable radicals or dianion 7,w hich could indicate ad ifferent mechanism. Thei onization energy of tBu 3 P( IE D = 5.54 eV), however, suggests that SET from the phosphine to the TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 adduct (E A = 5.57 eV) is still feasible.Inthis case,though, the subsequent radical coupling is barrierless, [23] which leads to the immediate formation of tBu 3 P-TCQ-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 (DE = À56.5, DG8 8 298 K = À20.4 kcal mol À1 )a nd prevents detection of radical species or subsequent reactivity to form dianion 7.This shows that, similar to our findings for Ph 3 SnH, changing from PMes 3 to PtBu 3 does not alter the mechanism, but merely the energy levels along the reaction path leading to observation of radical intermediates for PMes 3 ,but not in case of PtBu 3 .</p>
        <p>Since the groups of Melen and Ooi recently reported FLP type reactions featuring radical formation when using B-(C 6 F 5 ) 3 and carbonyl containing substrates, [6,7] we postulated that also in these cases Lewis acid coordination to the substrate could increase its electron acceptor capacity and promote SET (Scheme 6). Indeed, for methylvinylketone (MVK), the substrate utilized by Ooi et al. (Scheme 1d), [7] we found that B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 forms an adduct (DE = À16.3, DG8 8 298 K = 0.9 kcal mol À1 ;SCRF/wB97X-D/6-311 + G(d,p), solvent = dichloroethane) and increases its electron affinity from 1.43 to 2.73 eV (Scheme 7, left). This decreases the energy gap between the ground state amine donor (IE D = 5.11 eV; R = Me;Scheme 1d)and methylvinylketone acceptor pair to the corresponding radical ion pair [amineC + ,M VK-B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À ] from 3.68 to 2.38 eV,w hich results in visible light induced (1.5-3.1 eV,400-800 nm) SET becoming feasible.Indeed, Ooi et al. used 400 nm light to promote this reaction. In case of substrate 9,u sed by Melen et al. (Scheme 1c), [6] we found as imilar result. Binding of B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 (DE = À19.1, DG8 8 298 K = À0.2 kcal mol À1 ;S CRF/wB97X-D/6-311 + G(d,p), solvent = THF) increases the electron affinity from 2.31 to 3.56 eV (Scheme 7, right) bringing the energy required for SET (with PMes 3 as donor) down from 2.89 to 1.74 eV.T his reduced energy gap (40.0 kcal mol À1 )isstill sizeable and suggests that, also in this case,the SET is photo-induced and thus performing this reaction in broad daylight (or using ah igh-power LED) will be beneficial. These results,i nc ombination with the transient nature of the highly reactive B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 C À species in solution, [3a,24] make it highly plausible that also for these systems,B (C 6 F 5 ) 3 is facilitating SET through binding to the substrate and increasing its electron affinity,i nstead of participating directly in SET.</p>
        <p>Although the archetypal PMes 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 and PtBu 3 /B-(C 6 F 5 ) 3 FLP systems can form high energy radical ion pairs via photo-induced single-electron transfer,w ef ound that this pathway is not amajor contributor in the reaction with H 2 or Ph 3 SnH, and that in both cases the reactions occur via polar, heterolytic mechanisms.Furthermore,wediscovered that the SET reactivity observed for FLP systems with substrates featuring carbonyl moieties is not the result of SET from the Lewis base directly to the borane Lewis acid. Instead, adduct formation between the Lewis acid and substrate activates the substrate for SET,a fter which electron donor-acceptor complex formation with the Lewis base provides the corresponding radical ion pair, via either thermal or photoinduced SET,d epending on the energy required. To promote radical reactivity in cases based on photoinduced SET,i ti st hus important to locate the CT-band arising after Lewis acid coordination to determine the optimal wavelength for irradiation of reaction mixtures.These important mechanistic insights are of fundamental importance for both efficient usage of current radical FLP systems as well as the design of novel radical FLP systems and new examples of main-group redox catalysis, [25] which we are currently exploring in our laboratories.</p>
