        <p>Melanins are stable and non-toxic biomaterials with a great potential as chemopreventive agents for diseases connected with oxidative stress, but the mechanism of their antioxidant action is unclear. Herein, we show that polydopamine (PDA), a well-known synthetic melanin, becomes an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROOC, typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOOC). The key reaction explaining this peculiar antioxidant activity is the reduction of the orthoquinone moieties present in PDA by the reaction with HOOC. This reaction occurs via a H-atom transfer mechanism, as demonstrated by the large kinetic solvent effect of the reaction of a model quinone (3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone) with HOOC (k = 1.5 10 7 and 1.1 10 5 M À1 s À1 in PhCl and MeCN). The chemistry disclosed herein is an important step to rationalize the redox-mediated bioactivity of melanins and of quinones.Melanins are stable and non-toxic biomaterials with a great potential as chemopreventive agents for diseases connected with oxidative stress, but the mechanism of their antioxidant action is unclear.

        <p>Melanins are a family of intensely colored polymers derived from oxidative polymerization of phenols such as tyrosine, DOPA and dopamine. [1,2] Although the structure of melanins is not fully clarified, there is evidence that it consists of reduced (catechol) and oxidized (ortho-quinone) units (see Scheme 1 A). [3,4] Beside their important role in living organisms, [5][6][7] melanins are currently being investigated for many applications, including energy storage, biocompatible adhesion or coating systems, drug delivery, and skin protection. [5,6,8] Melanins have been proposed to possess a "multiantioxidative" activity, [4,5,8,9] that has been related, for instance, to their anti-inflammatory, [10] wound regeneration [11] and anti-ischemic activity. [12] Natural eumelanin incorporating large amounts of 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, DHICA (see Scheme 1 A), has been reported to have the strongest capability to quench radicals, as compared to synthetic melanins obtained by dopamine polymerization. [5] Polydopamine traps HOC radicals and has superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity (see Scheme 1 B) presumably involving the stable radicals "hosted" inside melanins. [8,9] Despite the number of publications reporting the antioxidant activity of melanins is steadily increasing, the mechanism of radical trapping remains unclear. Most mechanistic studies have been performed by using stable radicals such as DPPHC and ABTSC + (Scheme 1 B). [7,9] While these pioneering works have triggered the interest on melanins redox properties, these artificial radicals have limited similarity to transient alkylperoxyl radicals (ROOC) (Scheme 1 C). [13] The structure of melanins at the molecular level largely depends on the nature of the phenolic monomer, [7,14] on the polymerization conditions [14,15] and on post-synthetic functionalization. [12] Despite the efforts in this direction, [16] there is currently no accepted simplified model for the redox properties of melanins. A good starting point to face this problem would be having a clear understanding of the radical trapping behavior of the basic structural units that are present in all melanins, namely the 1,2-dihydroxy benzene (catechol) and the 1,2-benzoquinone moieties. [17][18][19] Herein we report the results of our studies of controlled radical chain oxidations carried on by mixed alkylperoxyl (ROOC) and hydroperoxyl (HOOC) radicals [20][21][22][23] to understand the reactivity and the mechanisms of antioxidant action of polydopamine (PDA, Scheme 1 A) and of two model ortho (1) and para (2) quinones (Scheme 2).Melanins are a family of intensely colored polymers derived from oxidative polymerization of phenols such as tyrosine, DOPA and dopamine.

        <p>The chain-breaking antioxidant activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated by measuring, at 30 8C and in a low-polarity solvent (chlorobenzene), the rate of O 2 consumption during the azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) initiated oxidation of styrene, a reference organic substrate whose autoxidation at low temperature is propagated by ROOC. [24,25] 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (CHD) was used as oxidizable co-substrate to produce HOOC [(Scheme 3, Eqs. ( 8) and ( 9)]. [20][21][22][23] As expected, [17][18][19] 1 and 2 had no effect on the peroxidation of styrene alone (Figure 1 A). When CHD was added to styrene, both quinones suppressed the peroxidation, as shown in Figures 1 A andS1.The chain-breaking antioxidant activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated by measuring, at 30 8C and in a low-polarity solvent (chlorobenzene), the rate of O 2 consumption during the azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) initiated oxidation of styrene, a reference organic substrate whose autoxidation at low temperature is propagated by ROOC.

        <p>Control experiments (styrene containing CHD but without quinones) indicated neither inhibition nor retardation, thus the strong inhibition observed for styrene/CHD/quinone can be explained by the reactions reported in Scheme 3. Comparing the kinetic traces in Figure 1, we should notice that 1 generates longer induction period than 2 used at the same concentration (see t 1 and t 2 ) and, additionally, the rate of O 2 uptake during the inhibition period is smaller for 1 than for 2, demonstrating a superior antioxidant activity of the ortho-isomer. To better clarify the mechanism proposed in Scheme 3, we completely replaced styrene with CHD. Figure 1 B presents the kinetic traces recorded for the system, with the autoxidation propagated exclusively by HOOC radicals. [22] Quinone 1 almost completely stopped the autoxidation of CHD (i.e. it trapped HOOC with high efficiency), while 2 was less effective even if used at much higher concentration. We also employed the reduced species, catechol/ hydroquinone, 1H 2 and 2H 2 to test their behavior during autoxidation of CHD. Results, reported in Figure 1 B, indicated a smaller and a higher HOOC trapping ability than the corresponding quinones for 1H 2 and 2H 2 respectively. [26] The use of CHD as the only oxidizable substrate simplifies the analysis of autoxidation kinetics, propagated only by HOOC [X = H in Eqs. ( 8) and ( 10)], since reactions ( 5) and ( 6) become unimportant. Having clarified that the antioxidant activity of ortho-benzoquinone 1 stems from its reaction with HOOC [Eq. ( 1)], in the initial stages of autoxidation when the inhibitor is 1, before a substantial accumulation of reduced 1H 2 [Eq. ( 2)], reaction (3) also becomes unimportant. There- fore, the rate constant for reaction (1) can be determined in first approximation by using Equation (11), which relates the rates of the inhibited and non-inhibited autoxidation (R inh and R 0 , respectively) to the rate constant for the reaction of the antioxidant with the chain-carrying radicals and the stoichiometry of radical trapping (n).

        <p>The rate of initiation (R i ) was determined experimentally as 3.1 10 À9 Ms À1 , while 2k t for CHD in chlorobenzene is 1.2 10 9 M À1 s À1 . [22] With the assumptions that the rate of the back reaction k À1 is negligible and that n = 2, k 1 was obtained as (1.4 AE 0.2) 10 7 M À1 s À1 . Numerical modeling of O 2 consumption traces of CHD and styrene autoxidations, inhibited either by 1 or 1H 2 , was then performed by using the full array of kinetic equations and the COPASI kinetic simulation software (see Supporting Information) [27, as illustrated in Figure 2 A. The optimized values of k 1 and k 3 obtained with this procedure were 1.5 10 7 and 1.5 10 6 M À1 s À1 , respectively, while for k À1 an upper limit of 65 M À1 s À1 was determined. Hence our results show that, counterintuitively, the oxidized quinone 1 is a far better antioxidant than catechol 1H 2 , but only in the presence of HOOC. Results also show that a substantial quantity of catechol 1H 2 is formed from 1 (Figure 2 A). This finding is again counterintuitive, as it means that the antioxidant is being reduced, albeit transiently, during the inhibition of CHD autoxidation. Formation of 1H 2 was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis performed on the reaction mixture containing 1, CHD and AIBN (Figure 2 B,C). Quinone 1 was visible only in positive ion mode mainly as 1 + Na + peak, while catechol 1H 2 could be detected in negative ion mode as 1H À . The same result was obtained by GC-MS, after derivatization of the sample with trimethylsilyl-N,N-dimethylcarbamate (TMSDMC) as silylating agent to protect 1H 2 from decomposition during the analysis (see Figures S5-S7).The rate of initiation (R i ) was determined experimentally as 3.1 10 À9 Ms À1 , while 2k t for CHD in chlorobenzene is 1.2 10 9 M À1 s À1 .

        <p>Analysis of the kinetic solvent effect (KSE) offered further insight in the reaction of 1 with HOOC. In acetonitrile, the inhibiting effect of 1 during the autoxidation of CHD was weaker than in PhCl (see Figures S8 andS9). Numerical fitting provided k 1 = 1.1 10 5 M À1 s À1 , that is 180-folds smaller than in PhCl. This type of KSE is well established for antioxidants whose mechanism relies on a rate-limiting formal H-atom transfer, which is hampered by occurrence of H-bonding to the solvent. [13] Normally, when the antioxidant is a phenol transferring the H-atom to a peroxyl radical, phenol itself is the H-bond donor (HBD), complexing to the solvent. [13,29,30] Here, instead, the role is reverted and the HOOC radicals act as the HBD. From the observed magnitude of this KSE, the ability of HOOC as H-bond donor, H-bond acidity parameter a 2 H , can be calculated [29] as 0.78, in reasonable agreement with previous estimates. [20,31] KSE is a proof that the reaction of 1 with HOOC involves a H-atom transfer (HAT) and that this process starts with formation of a pre-reaction H-bond complex competing with the solvent (Scheme 4).Analysis of the kinetic solvent effect (KSE) offered further insight in the reaction of 1 with HOOC.

        <p>Quantitative understanding of the reactions of these model structures could then be transferred to rationalize the behavior of PDA as a representative member of melanin biopolymers. Polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles were synthetized by the oxidative polymerization of dopamine in alkaline water/ethanol solution and were accurately purified by repeated centrifugation cycles (characterization by DLS, TEM and FT-IR is reported in Figure 3, S10-S12). [32,33] The nanoparticles were concentrated, dispersed in acetonitrile and then used as inhibitor in autoxidation studies. As shown in Figure 3 C, PDA itself had a modest antioxidant activity toward styrene autoxidation (solvent MeCN), presumably due to the low concentration of catechol moieties, or their engagement in strong intramolecular H-bonds. [34] Actually, on further extending the purification cycles, PDA showed even lower inhibition of autoxidation (Figure S13), suggesting that some catechol moieties could be physically trapped into the nanoparticle matrix, instead of being covalently bound, or could exist as small (extractable) oligomers or covalent adducts, such as the pyranoacridinetrione recently proposed. [35] Interestingly, after the addition of CHD the antioxidant activity of PDA became very prominent (Figure 3 C trace d). Under the same conditions, CHD had a negligible effect on 1H 2 (Figure 3 D traces d ande), while it greatly increased the activity of 1 (traces c and f). The modest reactivity of PDA toward ROOC can be explained by considering that the catechol moieties are strongly bonded to H-bond acceptors, such as carbonyl groups, present into the polymer (Figure 3 E). [36] Not H-bonded catechols which would be more reactive toward radicals than H-bonded ones, [13] are most probably oxidized during the preparation of PDA. Instead, upon reaction with HOOC, ortho-quinones can form "exposed" semiquinones and catechol groups able to trap both HOOC and ROOC.Quantitative understanding of the reactions of these model structures could then be transferred to rationalize the behavior of PDA as a representative member of melanin biopolymers.

        <p>To rationalize the antioxidant activity of PDA, the driving force for the H-atom transfer reaction of HOOC to 1, 2 and to the quinones relevant to the chemistry of PDA (3-6) was calculated (see Figure 4, S14-S17). The reaction of HOOC with 1 is much more exothermic than with 2, in agreement with the results from CHD autoxidation studies (see Figure 1) and with previous reports. [37,38] Dopaminochrome (4) (tran-siently formed during PDA synthesis) [7] doesnt react as efficiently with HOOC as dopaminoquinone (3) and indole-5,6-quinone (5). Interestingly, the indole-5,6-quinone-5,6dihydroxyindole dimer (6), proposed as building block of PDA, shows a high reactivity toward HOOC, fully consistently with experimental results. Moreover, ortho-semiquinones are stabilized by a strong intramolecular H-bond and are therefore generally unreactive toward O 2 . [37] These calculations further support our proposed mechanism to explain the antioxidant behavior of PDA. Regarding the semiquinonetype radicals naturally hosted in PDA (and in other melanins), contributing to the persistent EPR signal, [4,5] their rapid reduction to catechols by HOOC [Eq. ( 2)]-a reaction expected to be diffusion controlled from our numerical fittings-is also likely to have a role in the enhanced antioxidant behavior in the presence of HOOC, although its actual contribution might deserve further investigation.To rationalize the antioxidant activity of PDA, the driving force for the H-atom transfer reaction of HOOC to 1, 2 and to the quinones relevant to the chemistry of PDA (3-6) was calculated (see Figure 4, S14-S17).

        <p>The simultaneous presence of alkylperoxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals is a common feature in biological systems. [39] Alkylperoxyl radicals are responsible for lipid peroxidation of unsaturated membranes, [24] while the HOOC radicals are constantly produced by protonation of superoxide leaking from the mitochondrial respiratory chain and by the autoxidation of alcohols, aliphatic amines and alkenes. [21,23,40] The chemistry disclosed herein is an important step to rationalize the redox-mediated bioactivity of PDA and the prominent antioxidant chemistry of ortho and para-quinones. With the caution imposed by their distinctive chemical diversity, [14] it could also serve as a rational basis to understand the properties of other melanins and it might be implemented for the rational design of novel antioxidant biomaterials that can be selectively activated by hydroperoxyl radicals.The simultaneous presence of alkylperoxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals is a common feature in biological systems.
