        <p>Chemical reactions that reliably join two molecular fragments together (crosscouplings) are essential to the discovery and following manufacture of high-value materials like pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. 1,2 In this area, the introduction of amines onto functionalised aromatics at specific and pre-determined positions (ortho vs meta vs para) is currently a prerogative of transition metal-catalysed processes and requires halogen/boron-containing substrates. 3-6 The introduction of these groups around the aromatic unit is dictated by the intrinsic reactivity profile of the method (e.g. electrophilic halogenation, C-H borylation) so selective targeting of all possible positions is often not possible. Here we report a noncanonical cross-coupling approach for the programmable construction of anilines on demand, exploiting saturated cyclohexanones as aryl electrophile surrogates. The condensation between amines and carbonyls, a process extensively used by Nature and (bio)organic chemists, 7 is the enabling feature that ensures a predetermined and site-selective carbon-nitrogen bond formation, while a synergistic photoredox and cobalt catalytic system is simultaneously employed to progressively desaturate the cyclohexene ring en route to the aniline. As functionalised cyclohexanones are readily accessible with complete regiocontrol by well-established carbonyl chemistry, this approach offers a solution to bypass some of the frequent selectivity issues of aromatic chemistry. The utility of this novel C-N coupling protocol was demonstrated by the preparation of commercial medicines and the late-stage amination-aromatization of natural products, steroids and terpene feedstocks.Chemical reactions that reliably join two molecular fragments together (crosscouplings) are essential to the discovery and following manufacture of high-value materials like pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. 1,2 In this area, the introduction of amines onto functionalised aromatics at specific and pre-determined positions (ortho vs meta vs para) is currently a prerogative of transition metal-catalysed processes and requires halogen/boron-containing substrates. 3-6 The introduction of these groups around the aromatic unit is dictated by the intrinsic reactivity profile of the method (e.g. electrophilic halogenation, C-H borylation) so selective targeting of all possible positions is often not possible.

        <p>access to increasingly complex molecules. Within the realm of cross-coupling reactions, processes leading to the construction of C-N bonds across aromatic systems have played a fundamental role in assembling anilines, key structural elements of drugs, agrochemicals and materials. [8][9][10] Currently, the most reliable way to selectively introduce amines into specific positions on functionalised aromatics (ortho vs meta vs para), is to use palladium-or coppercatalysed strategies. 11 For these processes to work, the aromatic coupling partner needs to be pre-equipped with a (pseudo)halide (Buchwald-Hartwig 4, 12 and Ullmann 6 crosscouplings) or a boronic acid (Chan-Lam cross-coupling 5 ) in order to generate arylpalladium/copper species that, after amine coordination and reductive elimination, deliver the aniline in the required position.access to increasingly complex molecules.

        <p>However, site-selective preparation of functionalised aryl halides and boronic esters can be synthetically challenging due to the "double-edged-sword" nature of aromatic chemistry. While text-book knowledge can accurately predict where functionalities are to be introduced, it implies all other aromatic positions are frequently not accessible using the same method (Figure 1A). A classic example is electrophilic aromatic substitution chemistry (SEAr) 13 : while it is easy to halogenate the para-position of an electron rich aromatic, targeting the meta-site is difficult and multi-step sequences remain the only viable option. Conversely, meta-halogenation of electron poor aromatics is feasible but direct ortho-or para-functionalization is not. Likewise, aromatic C-H borylation is mainly controlled by steric factors, which makes ortho functionalization attenable only in the presence of directing groups. 14 Furthermore, when either electronic or steric bias are not present, both aromatic halogenation and borylation methods lead to mixture of constitutional isomers. More recently, direct radical C-H amination strategies have emerged, [15][16][17] but they require the use of electron rich aromatics and generally display strong para-selectivity. Taken together, these aspects highlight some of the synthetic challenges that are encountered while attempting "user-defined" aromatic functionalizations when the targeted position is contrary to that controlled by electronic and/or steric factors.However, site-selective preparation of functionalised aryl halides and boronic esters can be synthetically challenging due to the "double-edged-sword" nature of aromatic chemistry.

        <p>Hence, the development of a robust catalytic strategy that relies on coupling partners with different functionalization chemistry can enable access to synthetically challenging targets. In this work, we report a protocol for aniline preparation based on the coupling between amines and cyclohexanones as saturated aryl electrophiles surrogates. This approach centres on two main aspects: (1) The general and benchmarked reactivity of the carbonyl group is harnessed to install with complete control various functionalities around the pre-aromatic building block and (2) the condensation between ketones and amines, a process fundamental in Nature 18 as well as organic synthesis 19 and catalysis, 20 is used as blueprint for site-selective sp 2 C-N bond formation in place of reductive elimination.Hence, the development of a robust catalytic strategy that relies on coupling partners with different functionalization chemistry can enable access to synthetically challenging targets.

        <p>The prospect of using saturated aryl surrogates for the synthesis of aromatic building blocks has been pioneered by Stahl's oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexanones into phenols using Pd(II)-catalysis under O2 atmosphere at high temperature. 21 While attempts have been made to extend this reactivity mode to cyclohexanone imines for anilines synthesis, the harsh reaction conditions have somewhat limited functional group compatibility and synthetic applications. 22,23 We conjectured if an alternative strategy based on photoinduced SET (single-electron transfer) could provide a general and reliable framework for the preparation of complex anilines with drug-like structural features. To achieve this goal, we became interested in the possibility of merging enamine oxidation chemistry 24,25 with the known ability of cobaloxime systems to intercept carbon-radicals and trigger dehydrogenation reactions. [26][27][28] A mechanistic outline for the coupling between morpholine 1 and 4methylcyclohexanone 2 is depicted in Figure 1B. Upon condensation, the in situ generated enamine A can be efficiently oxidized (Eox = + 0.56 V vs SCE; kSV = 2882 M -1 ) by the visible light-excited photocatalyst [Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2]PF6 (*Ered = +0.66 V vs SCE). 29 Due to the enhanced acidity of the a-methylene unit in the enaminium radical B, 30 a deprotonation can take place leading to the nucleophilic 5pe -a-enamine radical C. 25 The reaction between alkyl radicals and Co(II) complexes is reported to occur at nearly diffusion-control rates and give organocobalt(III) intermediates that undergo facile b-hydride eliminations. 31 We therefore proposed that intermediate C might be intercepted by the cobaloxime co-catalyst to deliver di-enamine D along with a cobalt(III) hydride species. By reaction with protic sources (e.g. DABCO-H + ), Co(III)-H derivatives have been reported to evolve H2 32 resulting in Co(III) complexes (for Co(dmgH)2(DMAP)Cl: Ered = -0.47 V vs SCE). This species could therefore undergo a SET with the reduced Ir(II) photocatalyst (Ered = -1.51 V vs SCE) 29 thus simultaneously turning over the photoredox and the cobalt cycles. At this point, we posited that the highly electron rich dienamine D might participate as the starting material in a second and identical oxidation-dehydrogenation process to produce the fully aromatized aniline 3. Critical for the success of this strategy is the use of photocatalysts with moderate oxidative power in order to achieve the selective and sequential oxidation of A and D over 3 (Eox = +0.88 V vs SCE), which would lead to decomposition pathways (a more detailed discussion on the experiments carried out to support this mechanistic proposal can be found in the ESI). Overall, with the realization of this strategy we would use classic imine condensation chemistry to forge a sp 2 C-N bond while the Ir-Co system would effectively "chain-walk" around the cyclohexyl ring, triggering two sequential dehydrogenations en route to a thermodynamically stable aromatic system. Finally, it is worth considering that, in contrast to classical cross-couplings based on aryl halides/boronic acids, this redox-neutral reaction would generate H2O and H2 as the sole stoichiometric by-products thus exhibiting excellent atom-economy.The prospect of using saturated aryl surrogates for the synthesis of aromatic building blocks has been pioneered by Stahl's oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexanones into phenols using Pd(II)-catalysis under O2 atmosphere at high temperature. 21 While attempts have been made to extend this reactivity mode to cyclohexanone imines for anilines synthesis, the harsh reaction conditions have somewhat limited functional group compatibility and synthetic applications. 22,23 We conjectured if an alternative strategy based on photoinduced SET (single-electron transfer) could provide a general and reliable framework for the preparation of complex anilines with drug-like structural features.

        <p>Pleasingly, the realization of this amination platform was possible by using AcOH as the Brønsted acid additive (to aid enamine formation) and DABCO (1,4diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) as the base in CH3CN solvent under blue light irradiation (Figure 1C; the details of the reaction optimization are discussed in the ESI). Under these mild reaction conditions, amine 1 and cyclohexanone 2 gave aniline 3 in 80% yield. With an optimised set of reaction conditions in hand, the scope of both the amine and the cyclohexanone partners was investigated (Figures 2 and3). As part of an ongoing collaboration, we consulted with AstraZeneca to benchmark this novel process for aniline synthesis using a diverse set of substrates relevant to the pharmaceutical sector.Pleasingly, the realization of this amination platform was possible by using AcOH as the Brønsted acid additive (to aid enamine formation) and DABCO (1,4diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) as the base in CH3CN solvent under blue light irradiation (Figure 1C; the details of the reaction optimization are discussed in the ESI).

        <p>Piperidine is the most prevalent N-heterocycle in commercial drugs and the most common sites for functionalization are C-3 and C-4. 33 Pleasingly, many sensitive polar functionalities 34 like free alcohol (4), ketone (5), which could interfere with the enamine formation, aryl ether (6) and sulphonamide (7) at either C-3 or C-4 were tolerated. Other important motifs like a C-4 tertiary benzylic alcohol, frequently found in the core of many antipsychotic drugs (e.g. haloperidol) (8) and a C-3 spirocyclic N-Boc protected piperidine ring (9), could be present. Piperazines, the second most frequent Nheterocycle in medicines, 33 were competent in the process despite the decreased nucleophilicity of their free amine group. In this case we succeeded in using a 2,5disubstituted enantiopure cyclic a-aminoester (10) and an N-arylated substrate resulting in an unsymmetrical N,N-diaryl piperazine (11). The chemistry was also extended to functionalized morpholines (12-14) and pyrrolidines (15-17) and this included an enantiopure C-2 alkylated building block (14) that is known to be troublesome under transition-metal catalytic approaches due to unwanted epimerization 35 , which we engaged in our protocol without loss of enantiopurity. We also successfully engaged bicyclic heterocycles (18-21) of high sp 3 content, which are privileged motifs in current drug discovery programs. Both acyclic secondary and primary amines worked well (22-25), which allowed us to benchmark the process with substrates containing C-2 and C-3 substitute pyridines (26-28). The high yielding formation of 29 and 30 is noteworthy as cyclobutyl amine cannot be used in nitrogenradical based approaches (competitive ring-opening), 36 while fluoroalkylamines require forcing conditions in palladium cross-couplings. 37 Having evaluated electronic effects, we also confirmed that steric encumbrance does not hamper reactivity as demonstrated by the high yielding preparation of 31-33, which include the arylation of the terpenoid (-)-cis-myrtanylamine (33). Anilines are powerful starting materials as demonstrated by the formation of 34-38 which include C-2, C-3 and C-4 functionalized pyridines derivatives. Aminoacids were tested next and we successfully engaged Lphenylalanine (39), L-serinamide (40) and L-lysine (41) thus demonstrating that both side-chain and central NH functionality can be targeted. As the final element to the amine substrate scope, we used this reaction for the arylation of riluzole (42 ¨ 43), a medicine used for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and (-)-cytisine (44 ¨ 45), an alkaloid with interesting biological profile. The N-arylation of this natural product has only been attempted using SNAr chemistry under harsh conditions, 38 which demonstrates the complementarity that this approach might bring to mainstream crosscoupling technologies. To further explore the capability and generality of this strategy, the reaction was evaluated with respect to the cyclohexanone scope using trans-4methylcyclohexylamine 46 (Figure 3A). In this case, we were interested in leveraging classic carbonyl chemistry to access a-, band g-functionalized cyclohexanones, that would correspond to synthetically challenging ortho-, meta-and para-functionalised aryl halides/boronics required for cross-coupling. Simple enolate chemistry enabled asubstitution, which was used to access ortho-alkyl (47 and 48), fluoro (49) and aryl (50) anilines, while ring-opening of cyclohexene oxide delivered functionalised orthoaminophenol and phenylenediamine (51 and 52). The preparation of metaaminophenols (e.g. 53) is synthetically challenging, but overcome in our approach by harnessing enone conjugate addition (both ionic and radical) to install of b-oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, boron and carbon-based substituents for the following efficient metaamination (53-59). Conversely, the preparation of para-substituted anilines is trivial on electron rich aromatics by either ionic halogenation and coupling, or radical amination and can also be achieved in our method using g-substituted cyclohexanones (60-62). However, para-functionalization is considerably more challenging on system containing electron withdrawing groups (e.g. to give 63). In our case, the text-book Diels-Alder reaction with Danishefsky's diene was used to access the desired cyclohexanones that were converted into 63 and 64 in high yields. Furthermore, 1-and 2-tetralones were used to access 1-and 2-napthylamine derivatives 65 and 66 respectively in high yields.Piperidine is the most prevalent N-heterocycle in commercial drugs and the most common sites for functionalization are C-3 and C-4. 33 Pleasingly, many sensitive polar functionalities 34 like free alcohol (4), ketone (5), which could interfere with the enamine formation, aryl ether (6) and sulphonamide (7) at either C-3 or C-4 were tolerated.

        <p>A final class of aryl surrogates that we considered were heterocycle-annulated cyclohexanones (Figure 3B). As these materials are easily accessed by classic condensation chemistry, their implementation would provide a valuable alternative for the preparation of aminated heterocycles, which are a known synthetic challenge both in terms of aryl halide/boronic acid starting material synthesis and following crosscoupling. 39 Pleasingly, using 1 as the amine we efficiently prepared 5-and 8morpholino-quinolines (67 and 68) and -benzothiophenes (69 and 70), as well as 5morpholino-benzofuran (71), -indole (72) and -indazole (73). An interesting application of this reactivity would be the use of ammonia to access free anilines, an important class of building blocks. We evaluated this possibility by performing late-stage aromatization-amination of commercial and high-value materials. As shown in Figure 4A, using stoichiometric quantities of ammonia (7 M in MeOH) we converted the A ring of the birth control medicine levonorgestrel (74) and estra-5,9-diene-3,17-dione (76) into anilines 75 and 77 in high yields. This protocol can also be used for the valorisation of feedstocks. For instance, cheap and readily available terpenes like dihydrocarvone (78, 1.7 USD/gram) and (-)-menthone (80, 1.3 USD/gram) were elaborated into the corresponding ortho,meta-disubstituted anilines 79 and 81, which are high-value chemicals currently manufactured via aromatic nitration followed by reduction (79: 685 USD/gram and 81: 851 USD/gram). Finally, we applied this reactivity to cycloheximide (82), a naturally occurring fungicide. In this case, aromatization-amination was achieved but concomitant removal of the lateral b- hydroxy functionality took place leading to 83 in high yield. We believe this unexpected outcome introduces a powerful retrosynthetic disconnection where aldehydes and ketones can be used as alkyl surrogates for the assembly of challenging ortho-alkyl anilines (Figure 4B). Accordingly, simple aldol chemistry can be used to create the "ortho" C-C bond which, upon photoredox dehydrogenative amination, would be converted into the alkyl chain (84-86). As the b-hydroxyl group is removed as part of a cascade process involving an initial E1cB step, the presence of stabilizing aryl or vinyl groups alter this reactivity and can be used to install olefin functionalities (87 and 88, the proposed mechanism for these cascade reactions are discussed in the ESI). For use in dehydrogenative amination chemistry, we relied on a b-selective oxidation 40 of N-Ac-cyclohexylamine that gave 98. A following aromatization-amination, followed by acid work-up, with commercial 99 gave the corresponding monoarylated piperazine, that was alkylated as described in the literature to give 100 in two steps. (5) The copper-catalysed conjugate addition of an aryl Grignard was exploited to established the bis-meta-substituted biphenyl unit present in solabegron (103), a drug used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Simple coupling of 101 with the N-Boc-protected ethylene diamine 102 gave, following known epoxide opening and ester hydrolysis, 41 the desired drug 103. (6) We used classical aldol annulation chemistry to The mild conditions and broad functional group compatibility of this coupling protocol between amines and cyclohexanones opens up access to anilines that are difficult to prepare using either nitration chemistry or classical cross-coupling reactions. We believe this strategy introduces a novel retrosynthetic disconnection for the assembly of complex and densely functionalised nitrogenated aromatics of academic and industrial interest.A final class of aryl surrogates that we considered were heterocycle-annulated cyclohexanones (Figure 3B). As these materials are easily accessed by classic condensation chemistry, their implementation would provide a valuable alternative for the preparation of aminated heterocycles, which are a known synthetic challenge both in terms of aryl halide/boronic acid starting material synthesis and following crosscoupling. 39 Pleasingly, using 1 as the amine we efficiently prepared 5-and 8morpholino-quinolines (67 and 68) and -benzothiophenes (69 and 70), as well as 5morpholino-benzofuran (71), -indole (72) and -indazole (73).

As the b-hydroxyl group is removed as part of a cascade process involving an initial E1cB step, the presence of stabilizing aryl or vinyl groups alter this reactivity and can be used to install olefin functionalities (87 and 88, the proposed mechanism for these cascade reactions are discussed in the ESI). For use in dehydrogenative amination chemistry, we relied on a b-selective oxidation 40 of N-Ac-cyclohexylamine that gave 98. A following aromatization-amination, followed by acid work-up, with commercial 99 gave the corresponding monoarylated piperazine, that was alkylated as described in the literature to give 100 in two steps. (5) The copper-catalysed conjugate addition of an aryl Grignard was exploited to established the bis-meta-substituted biphenyl unit present in solabegron (103), a drug used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Simple coupling of 101 with the N-Boc-protected ethylene diamine 102 gave, following known epoxide opening and ester hydrolysis, 41 the desired drug 103. (6) We used classical aldol annulation chemistry to The mild conditions and broad functional group compatibility of this coupling protocol between amines and cyclohexanones opens up access to anilines that are difficult to prepare using either nitration chemistry or classical cross-coupling reactions. We believe this strategy introduces a novel retrosynthetic disconnection for the assembly of complex and densely functionalised nitrogenated aromatics of academic and industrial interest.</p>
