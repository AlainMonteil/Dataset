        <p>Similarly, for NDUFA9, we can see that the compartments with more presence of the protein after FR4 are those corresponding to the nuclear compartment (FR5 and FR6) (see figure below). Moreover, in the Thul et al work, they also refer to ribosomal protein L19 as potentially present in the cytosol, the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleoli. Same as before, we extracted the information for those proteins from our datasets, and found that those multiple location matches our quantitative data. When we plot the scaled intensity distribution of this protein across our six fractions, we can clearly see that it also in our datasets is distributed across those three subcellular compartments (see figure below).Similarly, for NDUFA9, we can see that the compartments with more presence of the protein after FR4 are those corresponding to the nuclear compartment (FR5 and FR6) (see figure below).

        <p>The algorithm counts markers for all subcellular locations within all groups. All proteins in the same group are assigned to the location with the highest marker count. Thus, if there are three markers for the nucleus and two for the cytosol, all are assigned to the nucleus. The purity is, however only 0.6; 3/(3+2), and the total number of markers in the group is 3. Higher purity and higher marker counts indicate higher precision for the assigned locations.The algorithm counts markers for all subcellular locations within all groups.

        <p>Supplementary Figure 1 In the main manuscript text, we state that 82% of the proteins were reproducibly identified in two or more of the six subcellular fractions. It has been published that a significant part of the proteome is not restricted to only one subcellular location 1 . However, it is very important to differentiate between identification in a subcellular fraction and actual colocalization of a protein in a subcellular niche. Merely identification cannot provide accurate information of the subcellular niche of the protein. In contrast, that information should be derived from the quantification of a protein's abundance across the six fractions, i.e. the relative enrichment of the protein in each fraction. Throughout the manuscript, we use the relative enrichment in each fraction to extrapolate the subcellular niches, assigning the fraction with the highest intensity as the main subcellular location for a protein.Supplementary Figure 1 In the main manuscript text, we state that 82% of the proteins were reproducibly identified in two or more of the six subcellular fractions.

        <p>When trying to accurately assess dual or multiple locations of proteins, our approach is limited by the fact this it is comprising only six fractions, which can group several subcellular niches. Methods that provide higher resolution, such as hyperLOPIT 3 ,LOPIT-DC 4 or SubCellBarCode 5 , offer better insights in this regard. In fact, some bioinformatics tools have been developed to assess simultaneous protein sub-cellular localization in those datasets, such as the one described by Crook et al 7 . However, as already mentioned, the predictive outcome of this tool is better suited for subcellular approaches with more fractions analyzed.When trying to accurately assess dual or multiple locations of proteins, our approach is limited by the fact this it is comprising only six fractions, which can group several subcellular niches.

        <p>Nevertheless, although with certain limitations due to the purification of only six subcellular compartments, our approach can also identify proteins that are present in multiple compartments simultaneously. In fact, we demonstrated in the main text the dual, and also dynamic, location of EGFR-adaptor proteins SHC1, GRB2 and CBL, which were all found in both the cytosol and the membrane-associated compartment (Main Figure 4C). However, to assess if dual or multiple locating proteins are captured by our experimental approach, we investigated some proteins known to have dual localization according to the antibody-based fluorescent image analysis described in the publication by Thul et al 1 . As an example of proteins with dual/multiple location, Thul et al described CCAR1 and NDUFA9, which they found in both the nucleus and the Golgi apparatus or mitochondria, respectively. For both CCAR1 and NDUFA9, we find that in our dataset is in line with the observations by Thul et al as the majority of each protein is in FR5 (nucleoplasm) and FR4 (mitochondrion), respectively. Moreover, we can see some contribution of CCAR1 in FR4 (enriched in Golgi proteins), which is especially clear in Supplementary Note 2:
