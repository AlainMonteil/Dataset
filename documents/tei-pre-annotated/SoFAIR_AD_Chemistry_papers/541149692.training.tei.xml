        <p>Structural changes at the active site of an enzyme induced by binding to as ubstrate molecule can result in enhanced activity in biological systems.Herein, we report that the new hybrid ultramicroporous material sql-SIFSIX-bpe-Zn exhibits an induced fit binding mechanism when exposed to acetylene,C 2 H 2 .T he resulting phase change affords exceptionally strong C 2 H 2 binding that in turn enables highly selective C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 2 /CO 2 separation demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments.s ql-SIFSIX-bpe-Zn was observed to exhibit at least four phases:as-synthesised (a); activated (b); and C 2 H 2 induced phases (b' and g). sql-SIFSIXbpe-Zn-b exhibited strong affinity for C 2 H 2 at ambient conditions as demonstrated by benchmark isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st )o f6 7.5 kJ mol À1 validated through in situ pressure gradient differential scanning calorimetry (PG-DSC). Further,insitu characterisation and DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism of the C 2 H 2 induced fit transformation, binding positions and the nature of host-guest and guest-guest interactions.</p>
        <p>Theinduced fit mechanism is awell-known process for the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes that enhance activity. [1] In this phenomenon, the enzyme active site undergoes as tructural transformation to optimize the binding site for as pecific substrate (Scheme 1a). Induced fit plays an important role in biological processes such as signal transduction, signal amplification and others. [2] Whereas induced fit is prominent in enzymatic reactions,i ti sr are and poorly understood in the context of crystalline porous materials, where such behaviour could result in enhanced selectivity to enable challenging gas capture or purification processes. [3] Metal organic materials (MOMs) [4] such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs), [5] porous coordination polymers (PCPs) [6] and hybrid ultramicroporous materials (HUMs) [7] are typically sustained by linker ligands and metal-based Scheme 1. Induced fit transformations. a) Enzyme active sites can undergo structural changes to better fit asubstrate and enhance activity.b)Astimulus responsive ultramicroporous physisorbent that exhibits astructuraltransformation induced by asorbate would be expected to offer enhanced binding energy and in turn enable better separations.</p>
        <p>nodes and can overcome the limitations of traditional classes of porous materials such as zeolites. [8] Such porous coordination networks offer ah igh degree modularity which makes them amenable to design from first principles using crystal engineering strategies. [9] Asmall subset of MOFs and HUMs can undergo structural transformation upon exposure to stimuli [10] such as heat, gas/vapor or light could therefore be relevant for application in storage, [11] separations, [12] catalysis, [13] molecular sensor [14] and drug release. [15] There are at least 150 MOFs [16] that have been shown to exhibit flexibility among the &gt; 75 000 reported MOFs. [17] Theo rigin of flexibility has been well studied and is attributed to various mechanism such as breathing, swelling, switching,s hape memory and others. [10a,b,18] To our knowledge,t here are only five previous reports of induced fit driven by gas sorption. [19] Fore xample,R osseinsky et al. [19b] reported af lexible framework, (ZnGGH-1•DMF-H 2 O) (GGH = tripeptide glycine-glycine-l-histidine) which changes conformation to adapt to the shape and size of specific guest thanks to the flexible skeleton of the organic linker.ACPL network, [Cu 2 (pzdc) 2 -(bpy)] (pzdc = pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylate and bpy = 4,4-bipyridine), was found to contract upon heating the as synthesised phase;further contraction occurred with benzene occupying channels.T his induced fit is attributed to isomerisation from square pyramidal to square planar geometry. [19d] Similarly,aflexible chemisorbent, [Zn 3 (OH) 2 (btca) 2 ] (H 2 btca = benzotriazole-5-carboxylic acid), contracted after activation from its as synthesised phase and further contraction occurred following C 2 H 2 adsorption with binding affinity of 47.6 kJ mol À1 . [19c] Themechanism of contraction was driven by the binding affinity of C 2 H 2 towards unsaturated Zn centres and self-adaptive shrinkage of the framework. Whereas physisorbents can exhibit C 2 H 2 induced structural transformations, [20] flexible physisorbents that offer induced fit mechanisms for C 2 H 2 (Scheme 1b)h ave not yet been reported. We consider this to be ad esirable objective since high binding energy,l ow regeneration energy and good separation performance would be anticipated from such sorbents.</p>
        <p>Among commodity gases,high purity C 2 H 2 is the starting material for industrially relevant products such as plastics, vinyl compounds,a crylic derivatives and a-ethyl alcohols. [20f] Currently,C 2 H 2 is produced by the partial combustion of methane or through the cracking of hydrocarbons.However, this process generates impurities such as C 2 H 4 and CO 2 .T he similar quadruple moments and kinetic diameters (Table S1) of these gases makes the process of selective capture of one gas (for example,C 2 H 2 )f rom the other gases difficult and energy intensive.I nt his context, rigid MOFs with high C 2 H 2 affinity have been reported with binding driven by open metal sites, [21] hydrogen bonding, [22] synergistic effect of open metal sites and electronegative sites [23] or acidic/basic functional groups. [24] HUMs [7a] have also demonstrated high C 2 H 2 binding affinity over other gases such as C 2 H 4 , [25] CO 2 [26] and other hydrocarbon mixtures. [27] Fore xample,L ie tal. achieved benchmark C 2 H 2 selectivity over C 2 H 4 using SIFSIX-14-Cui. [25] Theh igh performance exhibited by HUMs has been attributed to ultramicropores (&lt; 0.7 nm), strong electrostatic interactions with the inorganic "pillars" (SiF 6 2À or SIFSIX) and pore structure.Overall, the current C 2 H 2 benchmark for isosteric heat of adsorption (Q st ), % 60 kJ mol À1 at low loading, rests with the rigid ultramicroporous MOF known as NKMOF-1-Ni. [28] Theb inding affinity of as orbent can provide ag uide to its separation performance for as pecific gas in am ixture of gases.F lexible physisorbents which exhibits induced fit have the advantage over chemisorbents. This is because flexible framework can recognise only specific guest molecule vs.d ifferent multiple guest and then adopt new configuration from their original structure especially those designed with special binding sites (for example, originating from inorganic pillar) and flexible skeleton from ligand. That newly transformed structure induces tight cavity for that specific guest, combining strong interactions lead to extraordinary guest binding affinity with low regeneration energy.H erein we report that the use of an inorganic pillar, SiF 6 2À and af lexible dipyridyl linker ligand affords an ew flexible physisorbent [Zn(SiF 6 )(1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane) 2 ] n , which exhibits induced fit in single crystal to single (SC-SC) fashion when exposed to C 2 H 2 under ambient conditions.Insitu X-ray diffraction was used to study the reversibility of the phase transformations and the switching mechanisms driven by C 2 H 2 and CO 2 loading at 195 K. As revealed herein, the observed SC-SC transformations are driven by host-guest interactions with the inorganic pillar and therefore differ from the previously reported examples of induced fit binding (Table S2).</p>
        <p>[Zn(SiF 6 )(bpe) 2 ] n exists as a3 Dp cu or 2D sql network when prepared from 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl) ethane and ZnSiF 6 2À using different solvent combinations.C hloroform and methanol resulted in the pcu variant (Figure S1). Single-crystal Xray diffraction (SC-XRD) revealed that the organic linker adopts the trans-conformation and orthorhombic space group Ibam (Table S3). Single crystals were unstable to loss of guest, making it a1 st generation PCP. [6] When pure methanol was used, single crystals of the sql variant were harvested. Crystals were observed to be stable when removed from other liquor and SC-XRD revealed that bpe linkers are in cis-conformation and the monoclinic space group C2/c was adopted (Table S3). Thea bility of bpe to exhibit conformational flexibility is long known. [29] Thesql phase (sql-SIFSIXbpe-Zn-a;F igure 1) exhibits 18 %g uest-accessible volume which is occupied by methanol molecules.The void space was calculated with ap robe radius of 1.2 and ag rid spacing of 0.7 .Single crystals of the activated or b phase (sql-SIFSIXbpe-Zn-b)w ere obtained by heating the a phase at 353 K under vacuum for 12 h.</p>
        <p>The b phase transformed to the triclinic space group P-1with adensity of 1.351 gcm À3 well below that of the a phase (1.523 gcm À3 ). Thec rystal structures of the b phase revealed that its 2D networks are distorted and the guest-accessible volume is reduced to 14 %( Figures 2a andb). Thep hase transformation from a to b was also studied by in situ variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) at intervals of 10 8 8Ce very 10 min, which revealed that transformation occurred at 333 K( Figure S2). This phase change was also observed in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements as as mall exothermic peak occurred at 333 K (Figure S3). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that both the a and b phases were stable up to 463 Kw ith % 13 %w eight loss for a,w hich corresponds to 5M eOH molecules per unit cell that include one additional methanol from the surface of crystals (Figure S4).</p>
        <p>To study the porosity of sql-SIFSIX-bpe-Zn, gas sorption isotherms were measured for CO 2 at 195 K, C 2 H 2 at 195 K, and N 2 at 77 K. Prior to gas sorption measurements,t he a phase was activated at 353 Ku nder vacuum for 12 h. A stepped isotherm was observed for C 2 H 2 adsorption at 195 K (Figure S8). Aplateau from 0to40cm 3 g À1 (2 guests per unit cell) was observed upon increasing the pressure up to p/p 0 = 0.01, followed by asudden increase in uptake to 82 cm 3 g À1 (4 guests per unit cell), which is the saturated uptake at p/p 0 = 1. In the case of CO 2 adsorption (Figure S9), as light inflection was observed up to p/p 0 = 0.008 in the uptake range from 30 to 65 cm 3 g À1 .S aturated CO 2 uptake (80 cm 3 g À1 ,4CO 2 per unit cell) was the same as that for C 2 H 2 at p/p 0 = 1. In both isotherms,desorption matches the adsorption profile and the PXRD pattern after desorption indicates that the b phase is recovered (Figure S11). N 2 sorption revealed atypical type-I isotherm with saturated uptake limited to only 38 cm 3 g À1 at p/ p 0 = 1, which is approximately equal to 2g uests per unit cell (Figure S10).</p>
        <p>To gain insight into the mechanism behind the stepped isotherm, in situ coincidence PXRD measurements during C 2 H 2 and CO 2 adsorption at 195 Kw ere conducted. Af ew selected adsorption and desorption points in each sorption profile in which significant phase change occurred are plotted in Figure 3. Diffraction patterns from point 6to87are shown for C 2 H 2 at 195 Ki nF igure 3a.C 2 H 2 sorption revealed that the b phase remains to point 44 with an uptake of 40 cm 3 g À1 . Further increase in pressure afforded new peaks after the step that we attribute to the structural transformation from b to an ew more open phase, g (sql-SISIX-bpe-Zn-g). Thef ully loaded g phase remains unchanged during further adsorption (from point 46 to 55) and desorption (from point 78 to 87). Following the desorption process,weobserved that g returned to b as revealed by Figure 3a.W ith respect to in situ CO 2 sorption, the diffraction patterns indicated that transformation occurs from b to a in ar eversible manner.S elected patterns from point 1to77are plotted in Figure 3b.Atpoint 12, new PXRD pattern emerged, which remained unchanged to p/p 0 = 1a nd after desorption. TheP XRD pattern at fully loaded point 33 matches the a phase.Finally,after desorption, a returns to b as shown in Figure 3b.I n-situ PXRD patterns were also measured during N 2 sorption at 77 K( Figure 3c). ThePXRD patterns indicate that N 2 does not induce aphase change during sorption, presumably because of its weaker interactions with the sorbent. This can also be inferred from the uptake reaching 38 cm 3 g À1 at p/p 0 = 1, which is half of the uptake vs.C 2 H 2 and CO 2 .T oidentify guest binding sites upon C 2 H 2 sorption in situ gas loading experiments were conducted on single crystals.Asuitable single crystal was selected for these studies and activated in situ at 80 8 8Cf or 2hrs under vacuum. C 2 H 2 was dosed into the capillary when the temperature had reached 298 K. Cooling to 195 Kr evealed that transformation from b to g occurred within 30 mins,a s confirmed by ac hange in unit cell parameters.S CXRD analysis revealed that the g phase retained the same space group as the b phase and that there are four distinct C 2 H 2 binding sites (Table S3 and Figure S15). Theo ccupancyo f each C 2 H 2 site was refined at 0.5, which we attribute to slow loading kinetics.The calculated PXRD pattern for the g phase matches the in situ PXRD pattern at adsorption point 55 as revealed by Figure 3a Then ature of the pore size and chemistry of the b phase prompted us to explore gas sorption of C 2 H 2 ,C 2 H 4 ,C H 4 , C 2 H 6 ,a nd CO 2 at 298 K. C 2 H 2 exhibited strong affinity with sharp uptake at low pressures compared to the other four gases (Figure 4a andS16). TheC 2 H 2 uptake was 26 cm 3 g À1 at p/p 0 = 0.01, reached close to saturation at ar elatively low pressure (p/p 0 = 0.1) with an uptake of 38 cm 3 g À1 and was saturated (40 cm 3 g À1 )atp/p 0 = 1. In contrast, the C 2 H 4 ,C 2 H 6 and CO 2 sorption isotherms exhibited negligible uptake at p/ p 0 = 0.01 whereas increasing pressure to p/p 0 = 0.1 resulted in uptakes of 11, 5a nd 24 cm 3 g À1 ,r espectively.T he uptake capacity at p/p 0 = 1was found to be 28, 18 and 40 cm 3 g À1 for C 2 H 4 ,C 2 H 6 and CO 2 ,r espectively.I nterestingly,m olecular sieving behaviour towards CH 4 was observed, with asaturated uptake of only 3cm 3 g À1 at p/p 0 = 1. When fully saturated at p/ p 0 = 1, the guest occupancyfor C 2 H 2 ,C 2 H 4 ,C 2 H 6 and CO 2 was observed to be on the order of 2, 1, 1and 2molecules per unit cell, respectively.C ycling experiments indicated that C 2 H 2 sorption profiles were reproducible with the same uptake over 10 cycles (Figure S17). Sample regeneration was achieved by vacuum treatment at 313 Kf or 30 mins without additional heat. In order to calculate Q st ,w em easured sorption at various temperatures ranging from 273 to 328 Kin 5 8 8Cor108 8Cintervals (Figures 4b,S18, S19). Theresulting Q st calculations on C 2 H 2 sorption revealed that b offers an ew benchmark for sorbent-C 2 H 2 interaction energy (Figure 4c). A Q st value of 67.5 kJ mol À1 was observed at zero loading, this value decreasing to % 48 kJ mol À1 and then increased with uptake capacity.Conversely,C 2 H 4 ,CH 4 ,and CO 2 exhibits low affinity with Q st values of 38.4, 11, and 33.6 kJ mol À1 , respectively (Figures 4c andS23). Theo bserved interaction energy for C 2 H 2 exceeds previously reported materials as detailed in Figure 4d and Table S4, for example,S IFIX-3-Ni (Q st ,3 6.7 kJ mol À1 ), [26] SIFSIX-2-Cu-i (Q st ,5 2.7 kJ mol À1 ), [30] TIFSIX-2-Cu-i (Q st ,4 6.3 kJ mol À1 ) [26,30] and UTSA-300a (Q st , 57.6 kJ mol À1 ), [20e] Ni 3 (pzdc) 2 (7Hade) 2 (Q st ,4 4.5 kJ mol À1 ), [23] Fe(pyz)Ni(CN) 4 (Q st ,3 2.8 kJ mol À1 ), [31] Co(pyz)Ni(CN) 4 (Q st , 45-65 kJ mol À1 ), [32] ZUL-100 Q st ,65.3 kJ mol À1 )and ZUL-200 (Q st ,5 7.6 kJ mol À1 ). [20b] Other approaches that focus upon chemisorption can exhibit higher energies such as the nanotrap MOF ATC-Cu, for which a Q st of 79.1 kJ mol À1 driven by coordination between two metal centres was reported. [33] To further verify the energy of C 2 H 2 sorption, we conducted in situ pressure gradient differential scanning calorimetry (PG-DSC) measurements.T he enthalpy obtained for C 2 H 2 was in good agreement with the Q st obtained from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (Figures 4c andS24). [34] To address gas mixture selectivity we conducted ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) [35] calculations.I AST calculations are not always well-suited for induced structural transformations but the subtle transformations upon C 2 H 2 loading did not result in stepped or "S-shaped" isotherms,i nstead they appeared as Ty pe-I isotherms.Unfortunately,selectivity calculations using breakthrough data were infeasible because of co-adsorption and steps.Calculated IAST selectivity values at 1bar for both trace and bulk concentrations were as follows:C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 (1:1, 62.8 and 1:99, 53.1), C 2 H 2 /CH 4 (2:1, 2426 and 1:1, 2302) and C 2 H 2 /CO 2 (1:1, 8.4) (Figure 4e and Table S4). TheIAST selectivity for C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 2 /CO 2 can be compared to other leading sorbents (Table S4). TIFSIX-2-Cu-i has slightly higher selectivity for 1:99 C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 (55) but is lower for 1:1 C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 (45) and 1:1C 2 H 2 /CO 2 ,( 6.2) at 1:1. [26,30] Co-(pyz)Ni(CN) 4 offers higher selectivity for 1:1C 2 H 2 /CO 2 (36.5) but is lower for 1:99 C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 (24.2). [32] SIFSIX-3-Ni exhibited relatively low selectivity of 16.5, 17.6, 0.14 for C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 (1:99 and 1:1) and C 2 H 2 /CO 2 (1:1), respectively. [26] An umber of highly selective materials that were studied for one gas mixture only have recently been reported, for example,A TC-Cu (1:1 C 2 H 2 /CO 2 = 53.6), [33] Ni 3 (pzdc) 2 (7Hade) 2 (1:99 C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 = 168) [23] and Fe(pyz)Ni(CN) 4 (1:1 C 2 H 2 /CO 2 = 24). [31] In order to further investigate gas mixture separations,w ec onducted dynamic breakthrough experiments on 1:1m ixture upon Helium dilution. These experiments revealed that the breakthrough time for C 2 H 2 / C 2 H 4 was % 1h15 mins whereas that for C 2 H 2 /CO 2 was % 1h 40 mins (Figure 4f). C 2 H 2 uptake ( % 20 cm 3 g À1 )reached half of the total capacity (40 cm 3 g À1 )f rom sorption experiments and outlet purity was found to be % 99 %. To determine the gate opening temperature for C 2 H 2 ,C 2 H 4 and CO 2 ,w e conducted isobar experiments with increasing temperature from 195 Kt o3 28 K( Figure S26). In the C 2 H 2 isobar, the uptake capacity from 328 to 278 Kremained almost constant with avalue of 40 cm 3 g À1 at p/p 0 = 1. Asudden step occurred from 268 to 258 K, when uptake capacity nearly doubled ( % 77 cm 3 g À1 ). Decreasing in temperature from 258 to 238 K resulted in C 2 H 2 uptake gradually increasing to % 82 cm 3 g À1 , av alue that was maintained until 195 K. As imilar sorption profile was observed for C 2 H 4 ,b ut with av ery low gate opening temperature.N os tep was observed from 328 to 238 Kwhile alarge step from 228 to 218 Kwith an uptake of 80 cm 3 g À1 was seen. This type of switching isobar trend is rare in MOFs. [36] TheCO 2 isobar exhibits anormal trend, showing ag radual increase in uptake from 40 to 82 cm 3 g À1 with decrease in temperature from 328 to 195 K.</p>
        <p>To gain insight into the sorption performance and benchmark interaction energy towards C 2 H 2 ,w ec onducted in situ gas loading on single crystals,i ns itu coincidence PXRD and in situ FTIR measurements at 298 K( Figure 5). From in situ gas loading experiments,w eo btained the structures of b''2C 2 H 2 and b'2C 2 H 2 at less than p/p 0 = 1. In b',C 2 H 2 molecules were found to align between the SIFSIX pillars (Figure 5c). In the b phase,C 2 H 2 molecules were found to align between the SIFSIX pillars (site-I) and in adjacent cavities (site-II) (Figure 5d). In-situ coincidence PXRD measurements from selected adsorption (1-22) and desorption points (49-65) are plotted in Figure 5a.P oint 1indicates that the b phase remains unchanged. When the pressure is increased up to point 6, as light difference in the peak intensity is observed at lower 2q values,which nearly matches the calculated b' powder pattern. Further increase in pressure up to point 18 produces anew PXRD pattern corresponding to the b'2C 2 H 2 phase.After the desorption process,the pure b phase can be recovered as indicated in the calculated b powder pattern (Figure S11). In-situ FTIR study of C 2 H 2 adsorption reveals two stretching bands that indicate two different types of C 2 H 2 binding positions in the framework (Figure 5b). At low pressures (p/p 0 = 0.001 at point 4), aband at 3200 cm À1 emerges,w hich corresponds to C 2 H 2 at site-I. When the pressure is increased to point 20, another stretching band at 3311 cm À1 appears,w hich we attribute to C 2 H 2 adsorbed at site-II. Thet wo stretching bands are consistent with the binding positions identified in the in situ structures.</p>
        <p>To obtain abetter understanding of the interaction energy, we analysed the in situ structures obtained at 298 K. In 5e). There are also ). This analysis reveals that pore cavity in b' structure is more suitable to accommodate C 2 H 2 and energetically favourable than b. Therefore,w ec onclude that the following primary factors contribute to the induced fit mechanism in sql-SIFSIX-bpe-Zn:i )d egree of freedom in the structure and electronic structure of the system;i i) multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between C 2 H 2 molecules and SIFSIX pillars providing tighter binding site;iii)rotational motion of SIFSIX pillar and organic ligand that can undergo contortion.</p>
        <p>In summary,h erein we report an ew 2D flexible ultramicroporous physisorbent, sql-SIFSIX-bpe-Zn, that exhibits induced fit specifically for C 2 H 2 under ambient conditions and undergoes switching from open to more open phases induced by C 2 H 2 and CO 2 adsorption at cryogenic temperatures.T he induced fit transformation results in benchmark C 2 H 2 binding affinity thanks to at ight binding site that enables multiple sorbent-sorbate interactions.High C 2 H 2 selectivity and strong separation performance was found for C 2 H 4 and CO 2 binary gas mixtures.In-situ characterization using PXRD,SC-XRD, synchrotron diffraction, FTIR, and PG-DSC measurements were used to elucidate the mechanism of induced fit and identify sorbate binding sites.T he detailed in situ characterization results are supported by modelling studies provides insight that could be used to enable an ew and general approach to the design of the next-generation porous physisorbents:flexible ultramicroporous sorbents that exhibit induced fit for of as pecific gas molecule,r esulting in aselectivity hitherto unseen in rigid porous physisorbents.</p>
