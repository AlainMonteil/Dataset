        <p>Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) has been utilized as an adsorbent material for the removal of Pb(II) ions from aqueous solution after treatment with 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) at elevated temperature to obtain MMCC. The resulting adsorbent was characterized for point of zero point charge (pHZPC), estimation of carboxyl content, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scan electron microscopy (SEM), and textural properties, including surface area, and subsequently utilized for the removal of Pb(II) ions from aqueous solution. The adsorption process was probed by investigating the effect of adsorbent dose, pH of solution, temperature, agitation time, and Pb(II) ion concentration. The results showed successful functionalization of MCC using BTCA, which significantly improved the binding properties of the adsorbent towards Pb(II) ions. Isothermal adsorption data was analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin models, evaluated via nonlinear regression analysis. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 1155 mg/g (at pH 5 and 30 °C) from Langmuir theory, and appears independent of surface area. The Freundlich model was found to provide the best fit and the constant n was determined to be 2.69, indicating that adsorption of Pb(II) ions onto MMCC is favorable. Kinetic modelling showed good agreement for the pseudo-second order kinetic model, supporting the theory that chemisorption is involved in the adsorption process, which is promoted by a high density of active sites.</p>
        <p>Thermodynamic analysis showed that the adsorption of Pb(II) ions onto MMCC was endothermic and nonspontaneous; hence, MMCC offers an effective method of Pb(II) ion removal from aqueous solutions, with potential for water remediation processes.</p>
        <p>Water is a vital component in the survival of living organisms; however, increasing modernization and industrialization is adversely affecting clean water supplies. Species contributing to the pollution of water bodies include heavy metals, dyes, chlorophenols, surfactants, pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, resulting in negative impacts for both humans and animals through consumption. Due to their inherent toxicity and tendency to bioaccumulate, heavy metals pose a significant risk to human beings and aquatic life [1]. Within this group, lead can enter waterways from storage battery manufacturing processes, lead smelting and refining, and from mining processes. Aqueous phase lead continues to accumulate across the food chain via aquatic species, and by direct absorption [2]. Notable health impacts from Pb(II) poisoning include damage to the nervous system, renal failure, physical weakness, headaches, and brain damage [3], and the maximum concentration of Pb(II) permitted is 0.15 and 0.05 mg /l in drinking and wastewater, respectively [3].</p>
        <p>To reduce water contamination, various treatment methods such as neutralization, ion exchange, , solvent extraction, photochemical degradation, electrochemical degradation, membrane separation, reverse osmosis, precipitation and adsorption [4][5][6][7][8][9][10] have been investigated for the removal of heavy metals from aqueous streams. From these, one of the most effective methods is adsorption [11], where enhanced surface area, microporous structure, and high degrees of surface reactivity of adsorbents can improve adsorption capacity. Activated carbon offers such parameters as an adsorbent, and is consequently one of the most utilized materials in adsorption processes. Commercial materials can be expensive [12], which drives research to find cheaper, alternative heavy metal adsorbent materials.</p>
        <p>Recent studies have focused on creating green adsorbents, often based on cellulose as a consequence of their beneficial physical properties and renewable nature [14]. One family of promising adsorbents that have recently been developed are derived from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), which offer advantages through use of renewable feedstock, low levels of toxicity, low density, crystallinity, high surface area, good mechanical strength, insolubility in water and an ability to biodegrade [13]. One drawback to utilizing such materials is that cellulose lacks surface chemical moieties, which are required to complex with targeted heavy metal species. To counter this, esterification [15], etherification [16], oxidation [17], and graft copolymerization [18] have been used to functionalize cellulose to make it a stronger and more effective adsorbent.</p>
        <p>The aim of the present work was to develop a cellulose-based bioadsorbent for the extraction of Pb(II) ions from aqueous solutions using batch adsorption techniques, by modifying microcrystalline cellulose using butanetetracarboxylic acid. The effect of adsorption reaction conditions, including pH, adsorbent dosage, adsorbate concentration , contact time and temperature, on the adsorption capacity of Pb(II) ions were examined. The most suitable adsorption and kinetic models for the adsorption of Pb(II) onto modified MCC were determined by nonlinear regression methods. Thermodynamic parameter for this system was also determined.</p>
        <p>Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), ~50 μm particle size, 1, 2, 3, 4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA), lead acetate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), nitric acid (HNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and ethanol were supplied from Merck (Germany) and used as received (laboratory grade).</p>
        <p>A stock solution of Pb2+ was prepared (1000 mg/l) by dissolving the required amount of, Pb(CH3.COO)2 in double distilled water. The stock solution was diluted with double distilled water to obtain desired concentration, ranging from 100 to 1000 mg/l.</p>
        <p>The modified microcrystalline cellulose (MCCC) adsorbent was prepared in a beaker containing 2 g of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powder and a known weight of a dissolved 1, 2, 3, 4butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) in water and stirred with a spatula. The homogeneous paste was then dried in an oven at 100-160 °C and subsequently cooled to room temperature. The sample was washed with ethanol/water (80:20) for 2 h using vacuum suction filtration to remove any unreacted BTCA and soluble by-products. The purified material was dried at 80 °C for 3 h. Using a high temperature for a synthetic procedure involving BTCA, results in the anhydride form of the chemical to be produced, which reacts with the hydroxyl groups of MCC during heating to form the final MMCC adsorbent, as shown in Scheme 1:</p>
        <p>Scheme1: Reaction of MCC with BTCA to form MMCC at high temperature.</p>
        <p>A weighed sample of adsorbent (0.03 g) was added to a known volume (100 mL) of a Pb(II) ion solution (100-1000 mg L -1 ) in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask. 0.1 M HNO3 or 0.1 M NaOH was added to adjust initial pH values. The mixture was shaken at a constant speed of 150 rpm at 30 °C for a defined period of time and filtered using Whatman No. 41 filter paper to separate the adsorbent and metal ion solution. The metal ion concentration was measured before and after the adsorption using direct titration with a standard EDTA solution.</p>
        <p>The amount of Pb(II) adsorbed at equilibrium, qe (mg/g) was calculated using Equation (1):</p>
        <p>The percentage removal was calculated according to Equation (2):</p>
        <p>where C o and C e (mg L -1 ) are the initial metal concentration and metal concentration at equilibrium, W (g) is the weight of the adsorbent and V (L) is the volume of Pb(II) solution.</p>
        <p>The effect of temperature is crucial in determining the effective working capacity of a material under given operating conditions, consequently, the adsorption capacity of Pb(II) ions onto MMCC was determined at pH 5.5, for an adsorbent dose of 0.3 g L -1 , at 30, 50, and 60 °C.</p>
        <p>Carboxyl group contents of the adsorbent samples were estimated by adding 0.2 g of the adsorbent to a 125 mL flask containing 50 mL NaOH solution (0.03 N). The flasks were left overnight to equilibrate at room temperature and then the carboxyl contents determined via titration with standard HCl solution (0.01 N) using a phenolphthalein indicator [19]. The carboxyl content of the adsorbent sample was calculated using Equation (3):</p>
        <p>where Vo is the HCl volume (mL) consumed without the addition of the adsorbent in the blank experiment, Vl is the HCl volume (mL) consumed by the adsorbent sample, N is the normality of the standard HCl solution, and W is the weight of the adsorbent sample (g).</p>
        <p>Samples of MCC, MMCC, and MMCC loaded with Pb(II) post-adsorption were characterized using Fourier</p>
        <p>Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to assign vibrational frequencies of the different functional groups present in the parent adsorbent structure, as well as to determine the nature of any bonds formed between Pb(II) ions and the adsorbent surface. FTIR spectra of KBr discs containing ~2-10 mg of sample in ~300 mg of KBr were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum1000 spectrophotometer over a wavelength range of 4000-400 cm -1 at a scan interval of 1 cm -1 over 120 scans.</p>
        <p>A sample of each sorbent was coated with chromium on carbon tape and then imaged using a TESCAN CE VEGA 3 SBU (117-0195-Czech Republic) scanning electron microscope (SEM). Images were recorded using 1000 x magnification and the technique provided information on the morphology of the parent MCC and the MMCC adsorbent.</p>
        <p>Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) patterns were recorded using a dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDX) spectrometer (Oxford Instruments) attached to a scanning electron microscope (JEOL-JSM-5600). The characteristic band of lead metal was used to confirm the presence or absence of Pb(II) ions on postadsorption MMCC samples.</p>
        <p>The textural characteristics of MMCC were determined via nitrogen adsorption using an Autosorb I assembly (Nova 2000, Quantahrome Instrument, Beach, USA). Analysis was conducted using oxygen-free nitrogen gas at-196 °C, and the isothermal data obtained analyzed using the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method [20]. Mesopore volume, external surface area, and mesopore surface area were determined using the t-plot method [21,22], while the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda technique [23] was used to calculate the average pore width and obtain the pore size distribution.</p>
        <p>A solid addition method was used to evaluate the pH at the point of zero charge pHpzc for MMCC. Typically, 100 mL of 0.01 N NaCl was added to a series of conical flasks and the pH adjusted using an aqueous solution of 0.01 N HCl and 0.01 N NaOH to adjust the pH within the range 2 to12. The initial pH was recorded after a constant pH value was attained; thereafter,100 mg of the adsorbent was dispersed in the conical flasks and incubated for 24 h to obtain the final pH. The initial and final pH was plotted, with the point of intersection of the plots denoting the pHpzc of the adsorbent.</p>
        <p>Models used to fit the isothermal data obtained in this study were optimized by defining an error function to evaluate the fit of the isotherm to the experimental equilibrium data. The error selected were average relative error (ARE), average percentage error (APE %), sum squares error (ERRSQ/SSE), hybrid fractional error function (HYBRID), Marquardt's percent standard deviation MPSD, sum of absolute error (EABS), nonlinear chi-square test (χ 2 ), and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31], as shown in Table 1.</p>
        <p>In order to confirm the modification of MCC by BTCA, the surface functional properties of MCC, MMCC and MMCC-loaded Pb(II) were investigated. The spectra of native MCC (Figure 1a), exhibited adsorption bands at 3326 cm -1 (due to stretching frequency of the -OH group), 2892 cm -1 (due to C-H stretching vibration), 1644 cm -1 (due to bound water absorption [32,33]), and 1429 cm -1 (due to -CH2 scissoring).</p>
        <p>The absorption band at 1023 cm -1 was ascribed to C-O stretching vibrations, which symbolizes the glucose ring, and the intensity of this peak was unchanged after modification. Figure 1b shows that additional peaks were observed for MMCC; 1715 cm -1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of the newly formed ester carbonyl groups from modification of MCC with BTCA, while the characteristic peak located in 1428 cm -1 is ascribed to the -OH bending vibration from -COOH. This demonstrates the successful modification of MCC with BTCA. Figure 1(c) shows a small decrease in the absorbance peaks obtained for Pb(II)-loaded MMCC, as compared with that in MCC and MMCC, the bands previously observed at 3329, 1717 and 1645 cm -1 were shifted to 3328, 1714 and 1643 cm -1 , respectively, while new peaks are observed at 2094 and 1025 cm -1 , which can be attributed to the adsorption of Pb(II)ions onto MMCC.</p>
        <p>The surface morphology of MMCC is presented in Figure 2a The textural characteristics of MCC show a BET surface area of 2.9 m 2 g -1 with a total pore volume of 0.004 cm 3 g -1 , and an average pore width of 5 nm, and the average surface area is unaffected by conversion to MMCC. The average pore width is in the macropore region [34], which is beneficial for mass transport, particularly in aqueous systems, enhancing the adsorption of Pb(II) ions.</p>
        <p>Figure 3a shows the dependence of BTCA concentration on the extent of modification of MCC, expressed as m.eq.-COOH/100g sample. As expected, the carboxyl content increases significantly from 133.3 to 230.5 m.eq./100 g sample with increasing BTCA concentration, from 2.14 to 8.55 mmol/L; higher concentrations resulted in a plateaued maximum level of functionalization. This behavior can be ascribed to the increasing availability of BTCA molecules in close proximity with MCC macromolecules, as shown previously in Scheme 1, BTCA is converted to the corresponding anhydride through dehydration under the effect of high temperature before subsequent reaction with the hydroxyl groups in the MCC cellulose structure.</p>
        <p>The hydroxyl groups in the cellulose molecule are essentially the functional sites at which the esterification reaction occurs. Since these groups are immobile, it is essential that there should be a greater availability of butanetetracarboxylic acid molecules in the vicinity of the cellulose hydroxyl groups if reaction is to occur.</p>
        <p>The effect of reaction temperature on the extent of modification when MCC particles were treated with BTCA at different temperatures is shown in Figure 3b. The carboxyl content of MCC treated with BTCA increases from 52 to 230.5 m.eq/100g sample when increasing the reaction temperature from 100 to 140 °C; a decrease in carboxyl content is observed for reaction temperatures greater than 140 °C. The enhancement in carboxyl content of MMCC for temperatures in the range 100-140 °C may be associated with favorable thermal effects on cellulosic swelling and accessibility for reaction, the conversion of BTCA to its anhydride analogue, as well as increased mobility and reactivity of the resulting BTCA anhydride molecules with MCC to form MMCC. At higher temperatures, catalytic effects may hinder successful reaction and temperatures in excess of 160 °C were not used due to the conversion of cellulosic material to ash at such temperatures.</p>
        <p>MCC was modified through treatment with BTCA at a fixed temperature of 140 °C but using different reaction times of 15-180 min. It is evident from Figure 3c that the carboxyl group content of MMCC increased significantly from 128 to 232 m.eq/100 g sample for reaction times increasing from 15 to 60 min, before a subsequent decrease at longer reaction times. As may be expected, increased contact time can be seen to increase the level of functionalization, as seen here for MMCC, however, the decrease in carboxyl content from 210 to 143 m.eq/100g sample, observed for an increase from 60 to 180 min reaction time [35].</p>
        <p>Point of Zero Charge (pHpzc) and the effect of pH Data obtained for adsorption of Pb(II) ions by MMCC at pH range 2.0-5.0, and an initial Pb ion concentration of 400 mg/L, is shown in Figure 4a and allows the effect of pH to be probed. The adsorption of Pb(II) ions increased from 57 to 667 mg/g by increasing pH from 3.0 to 5.0. Within the system studied, there are two main steps that occur according to Equations 4 and 5 as follows:</p>
        <p>(4) Figure 4b shows the pHpzc data obtained for the surface of the MMCC adsorbent. The pHpzc of MMCC was determined as 4.0, which denotes the point at which a neutral charge is obtained and indicating an acidic nature for the surface of the MMCC adsorbent. When the solution pH is higher than the pHpzc, the surface will be predominately negatively charged and likewise will be predominately positively charged if the solution pH is lower than pHpzc [36], and the pHpzc can consequently provide insight into the electrostatic interactions between the surface of the adsorbent and adsorbate [37]. When the pH value of the solution is higher than pHpzc, the charge of MMCC surface will be negative and binding of cations will be favored.</p>
        <p>When the pH value of the solution is lower than the pHpzc, the surface charge of an adsorbent will be positive and, therefore, the adsorption of cations is unfavorable [38]. The optimum pH for MMCC to adsorb Pb(II) is 5.0 (Figure 4a) which is higher than the pHpzc. This leads to the predominant negativity of the adsorbent surface, which may lead to electrostatic attraction between the Pb(II) ions and negatively charged surface [39].</p>
        <p>The mass of adsorbent available within the system influences the adsorption of metal uptake from solution. The effect of MMCC adsorbent amount on adsorption capacity was studied at pH 5 using adsorbent doses in the range of 0.3-10 g/L and at an initial metal ion concentration of 400 mg/L (Figure 5a). It is evident that the adsorption capacity (qe) of Pb(II) ions per unit mass of adsorbent decreased from 664 to 37 mg/g, as adsorbent dose increased from 0. 3 to 8 g/L, with a plateau observed at higher adsorbent dosing. The decrease in adsorption capacity with increasing adsorbent dose is attributed to the high number of unsaturated adsorption sites, as well as overlap of adsorption sites and overcrowding of adsorbent particles [40].</p>
        <p>The effect of contact time on the adsorption capacity of MMCC towards Pb(II) ions, at initial adsorbate concentrations of 303 and 493 mg/L, is shown in Figure 5b. The adsorption capacity is seen to increase with both increasing contact time and increasing initial adsorbate concentration of the adsorbate. Equilibrium was determined to have been achieved at 120 min above which a plateau is observed.</p>
        <p>The Langmuir equation [41] is based on monolayer adsorption for a fixed number of localized sites, with homogeneous adsorption and no movement of adsorbate in the surface plane. The non-linear form of the Langmuir isotherm is represented by Equation ( 6):</p>
        <p>where KL refers to the Langmuir constant (L/g), aL is the Langmuir isotherm constant (L/mg), and kL/aL is the maximum adsorption capacity (qmax). The dimensionless separation factor, RL, provides an indication of the favorability of the adsorption process [42], and is represented by Equation (7):</p>
        <p>where Co is the initial adsorbate concentration in solution and b is the Langmuir constant.</p>
        <p>The logarithmic form of Freundlich model is expressed by equation 8 [43]:</p>
        <p>Where Ce is the concentration of Pb(II) ions at equilibrium, mg/L, qe is the amount of adsorbed Pb(II) ions per unit of weight (mg/g), and KF and n are Freundlich constants related to the adsorption capacity and favorability, respectively.</p>
        <p>The non-linear form of the Temkin isotherm [44] is represented by Equation ( 9):</p>
        <p>where AT is the Temkin isotherm constant (l/g), bT is the Temkin constant of heat of adsorption (joules/mole), T is the absolute temperature, and R (8.314 J/mol K) is the gas constant.</p>
        <p>Minimization of the error distribution between the experimental data and the data derived from predicted isotherms was performed using non-Linear analysis of a series of error functions. Experimental data were analyzed using the aforementioned two-parameter isotherm models, which were optimized using analysis of the average relative error (are), average percentage error (APE %), sum squares error (ERRSQ/SSE), sum of absolute error (EABS), and the coefficient of determination (R 2 ). Figure 5c shows the comparison between experimental and theoretical data of the two parameter isotherm models used in this study, Table 2 shows that the MMCC produced within the present work has a high affinity for the removal of Pb(II) ions (1155 mg/g) from solution when compared with modified Ratama raetam (270.27 mg/g) and other various adsorbents previously reported in the literature [45][46][47][48][49][50][51].</p>
        <p>The resulting error analysis and constants of the isotherm models are provided in Table3. As stated above RL from the Langmuir model indicates the favorability of the adsorption process; the value obtained here was 0.578, indicating favorable adsorption (irreversible (RL=0), linear (RL=1), favorable (0&lt;RL&lt;1), or unfavorable (RL&gt;1)). Additionally, the value of n, as determined from the Freundlich model (Table 3) was 2.69, again indicating that the adsorption of Pb(II) ions onto MMCC is favorable; however, a value of 1/n &lt; 1 suggests a slight suppression of adsorption at lower equilibrium concentrations. The maximum adsorption capacity of Pb(II) ions onto MMCC, according to Langmuir analysis was 1155 mg/L, which represents a significant level of available adsorption potential. Overall, as see in Figure 5c and Table 3, the highest R 2 value and lowest ARE, APE %, EABS and ERRSQ values indicate that the Freundlich model provides the best fit to the experimental isotherm data obtained in this study.</p>
        <p>The equilibrium capacity of an adsorption system must be matched by suitable kinetic performance for potential application of such adsorbents. In the present study four models were used to analyze the kinetics of adsorption for Pb(II) ions on MMCC, namely pseudo-first-order, pseudo second-order, Bangham, and intra-particle diffusion models. As for the adsorption models discussed above, the same series of fitting functions were used to determine the quality of the fits between experimental theoretical data.</p>
        <p>The pseudo-first order model is based on a physical and diffusion controlled process; the non-linear form of the model [52] is given in Equation 10:</p>
        <p>where qt is the amount of Pb(II) ions adsorbed (mg.g -1 ) at time t (min), qe is the amount of Pb(II) ions adsorbed (mg.g -1 ) at equilibrium and k1 is the rate constant (min -1 ).</p>
        <p>The pseudo-second order kinetic model [53] is assumed to involve physicochemical interactions between the adsorbent and adsorbate; the non-linear form of the model given in Equation 11:</p>
        <p>Where qt, qe and t are as defined above, and k2 (g.mg -1 min -1 ) is the rate constant for the kinetic model.</p>
        <p>Diffusion mechanisms cannot be elucidated by either the pseudo-first-order or pseudo-second-order kinetic models, hence, the intra-particle diffusion model is also used to evaluate the kinetic results. The overall kinetics of adsorption when controlled by intra-particle diffusion [54] can be expressed by Equation 12:</p>
        <p>where qt and t are as defined above, kid (mg.g -1 min 1/2 ) is the intra-particle diffusion rate constant, C (mg.g -1 ) is the concentration of Pb(II) at equilibrium. Previous studies reported that that the plots of qt vs. t 1/2 are multi-linear steps controlled the adsorption process [55,56]. Initially a curve is observed, indicative of bulk diffusion, followed by a linear portion, attributed to intra-particle diffusion, and finally a plateau once equilibrium is achieved.</p>
        <p>Bangham's kinetic model can be used to determine whether pore diffusion is the only rate-controlling step [57], through the quality of the fit, and is expressed by Equation 13:</p>
        <p>where qt, qe and t are as defined above, and kb is the rate constant for the model. In all cases, Table 4 shows the parameters determined for each model and the fitting parameters for the selected error functions. From fits shown in Figure 6 (a, b, c andd) and the data presented in Table 4, it is evident that the highest correlation function and lowest values for all other error functions, indicate that the Bangham and pseudo second-order kinetic models provide the best fits to the experimental data. This suggests that the adsorption process is controlled by chemisorption [58] and that pore diffusion is the only rate-controlling step in the process.</p>
        <p>The data obtained in Figure 7 indicate that the adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature.</p>
        <p>In the present work, thermodynamic parameters, including the standard free energy (ΔG o ), enthalpy change (ΔH o ) and entropy change (ΔS o ) were calculated through the application of Equations 14-16 [59].</p>
        <p>The standard free energy (ΔG o ) was calculated from Equation 14:</p>
        <p>where aL is the Langmuir constant, R is the universal gas constant (8.31441 J/mol•K) and T is the absolute temperature (K). The Langmuir constant, aL, can be used in the van't Hoff equation to determine the enthalpy change, ΔH°, of the adsorption process as a function of temperature (Equation 15) as follows:</p>
        <p>where aL1, aL2 and aL3 are the Langmuir constants at 30, 50 and 60 °C, respectively. The positive values of ΔG° obtained using Equation 14 and listed in Table 5 indicate the nonspontaneous nature of the adsorption of Pb(II) ions onto MMCC, which may be related to the chemical interactions of complexation. Additionally, a positive value was obtained for ΔH° in the range of 30-60 °C, using Equation 15and is shown in Table 5; this suggests that the adsorption process of Pb(II) ions onto MMCC is endothermic over this temperature range, which is indicative of a chemisorption process. Finally, the entropy change (ΔS°) was calculated from Equation 16:</p>
        <p>and the positive value of ΔS° in the range of 30-60 °C, is related to an increase in randomness at the solid/solution interface during the adsorption of Pb(II) ions onto MMCC. This can be ascribed to the deprotonation of the carboxylic groups and chelation of Pb(II) increasing the disorder within the chemistry of the system.</p>
        <p>Understanding the adsorption mechanism of heavy metal onto adsorbent makes it easier to remove heavy metals during wastewater treatment. It Is clear that the removal of Pb(II) ions from aqueous solution onto MMCC may be described by two steps; firstly, deprotonation of the carboxyl groups on the surface of MMCC, which resulted from the thermal treatment of MCC with BTCA, followed by a second step of chelation (complexation) between the electron-accepting Pb(II) ions and the electron-donating oxygen atoms of the carboxyl groups of MMCC as shown in Scheme 2. Such behavior was also observed for Cd(II) adsorption on modified pine sawdust [40].</p>
        <p>Bangham's model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating chemisorption within the adsorption process. Thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption process was non-spontaneous and an endothermic reaction with increased disorder in the adsorption system; all of which supports a process of surface group deprotonation and chelation of Pb(II) ions. These adsorbents show excellent performance for heavy metal ion remediation, which may be extend to other metals and inform engineering solutions for water treatment.</p>
