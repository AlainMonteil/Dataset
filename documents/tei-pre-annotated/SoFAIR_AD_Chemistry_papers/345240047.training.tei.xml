        <p>Fluoromethanol was the first reagent to be used for the electrophilic introduction of CH 2 F. Olah and Pavlath reported in 1953 the formation of fluoromethyl-substituted arenes upon reaction with FCH 2 OH in the presence of aLewis acid (ZnCl 2 ). [18] Recently,i th as been used for the fluoromethylation of special alcohols. [19] 2. 1.1. Fluoromethyl Halides Thef luoromethyl halides CH 2 FX (X = Cl, Br,I )a re all volatile,w hich represents ac hallenge when using these compounds.N onetheless,t his property is also an advantage as this volatility allows for an excess of the reagent to be readily separated from the product. In general, CH 2 FX halides are weak fluoromethylating agents.F luoromethylation through an S N 2reaction mechanism is more difficult than the analogous methylation with am ethyl halide. [5b, 20] The a-fluorine effect is responsible for this behavior (Figure 5). [21] Af luorine atom in the a-position stabilizes ap ositive charge by p-donation. This effect is so strong that the destabilizing inductive effect can effectively be ignored, and an S N 2reaction can only take place if agood leaving group is present at the CH 2 Fm oiety. [21b,c] Thus,t he reactivity of the CH 2 FX halides increases in the order Cl &lt; Br &lt; I. However, some reactions such as the electrophilic fluoromethylation of carbon nucleophiles,a sw ell as CH 2 Ft ransfer to weak nucleophiles,a re problematic. [22] Thef luoromethylating strength of CH 2 FX can be increased considerably through the presence of silver cations to bind the halide, [21b,23] making the fluoromethylation of weak nucleophiles such as NO 3 À [23] and ClO 4 À [21b] possible.I nitially,C H 2 FI (Orr, [24] 1963) and later CH 2 FBr (Lesuisse, [25] 1992) and CH 2 FCl (Sundermeyer, [26] 1985) was used for the fluoromethylation of al arge number of substrates. [25][26][27] Thea lkylation of as eries of oxygen, sulfur,n itrogen, and carbon nucleophiles by fluoromethyl halides has been described. [7a] Moreover,fluoromethyl halides have often been used as starting materials for more efficient fluoromethylating agents (Figure 6). [28] Thef irst fluoromethylated compounds acting as aromatase inhibitors, or compounds with anabolic properties,were prepared using CH 2 FI and CH 2 FBr. [24,25] Aseries of 18 F-labeled fluoromethylcontaining compounds that are frequently used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging have been prepared by employing CH 2 18 FBr. [29] One of the most important applications of CH 2 FBr is its use in the last step of the synthesis of Fluticasone TM , [30] which involves the fluoromethylation of at hiocarboxylate precursor at the sulfur atom (Scheme 1). Fluoroiodomethane [27c-e,31]] and the monosubstituted derivatives CHRFI [27f,g] and CHRFBr [27f-h] have been used in several cases to introduce aC H 2 Fo rC HRF group.T he first systematic studies on the fluoromethylation of phenols, thiophenols,imidazoles,and indoles with CH 2 FCl (Scheme 2) were reported in 2007 by Hu and co-workers. [5b, 22] Over the last ten years,several transition-metal-mediated fluoromethylation reactions starting from fluoromethyl halides CH 2 FX (X = Br,I )o rc arbon-monosubstituted derivatives thereof have been developed (Scheme 3). All of these syntheses involve C À Cb ond formation. Thus aryl boronic esters or aryl boronic acids can be converted into the corresponding fluoromethyl derivatives by coupling with CH 2 FI, CH 2 FBr, or CHRFBr (R = CO 2 Et, SO 2 Ph) in Pd 0 (Suzuki,[27i] Hu, [27c] Qing [32] )Cu I (Qing [27e] ), or Ni II (Zhang,[27b] X.-S.W ang [27f] )c atalyzed reactions,r espectively.N i II in combination with Mn has been used to promote the introduction of CH 2 F(X.-S.W ang [27a] )and CHRF (R = alkyl; X.-S.W ang [27g] )i nto heteroarenes and arenes starting from suitable heteroaryl bromides and aryl iodides by reductive cross-coupling.Fluoromethanol was the first reagent to be used for the electrophilic introduction of CH 2 F.

        <p>In 2008, Prakash and Olah developed ap owerful fluoromethylating agent that has been successfully applied in the fluoromethylation of numerous nucleophiles (Scheme 5). The fluoromethylsulfonium salt 13 is obtained in at hree-step synthesis with an overall yield of 60 %. [28b] Interestingly,t he first step-the synthesis of the fluoromethyl phenyl thioether-is reported with better yields in the literature. [5b] The sulfonium salt 13 is amoisture-insensitive solid;itis stable for several months in the solid state and is also stable in acetonitrile solution. However,i nD MF and THF,d ecomposition occurs. [28b] Substrates that possess heteroatoms as nucleophilic centers are readily fluoromethylated upon reaction with 13. In particular,fluoromethyl sulfonates can be prepared under mild conditions by using the sulfonium salt 13.H owever,i ts application to carbon nucleophiles has thus far remained limited to only afew compounds. [28b] 2. 1.4. N,N-(Dimethylamino)-S-phenyl-S-monofluoromethyl Phenyloxosulfonium Triflate Avery effective fluoromethylating reagent was developed in 2011 by Shibata and co-workers.

[17,43] Ad isadvantage of this reagent is its tedious,m ulti-step synthesis.H owever,w hen am odified procedure from the literature is used to simplify the synthesis of the fluoromethyl phenyl thioether intermediate, [44] the overall synthesis time can be reduced substantially from almost 9days to 1.5 days. [28b,43] Ther eagent 14 is as olid that is easy to handle and can be stored. [43] Although O-alkylation can also be performed well with other reagents,the E/Z stereoselectivity of 14 is particularly noteworthy.T he O-regiospecificity of 14 was explained by ar adical-like mechanism involving aS ET process. [45] However,S hen and co-workers reported that alcohols did not react with this reagent under the conditions applied. [28d] 2. 1.5. Monofluoromethyl-Substituted Sulfonium Ylides Completing the series of difluoromethyl-and trifluoromethyl-substituted sulfonium ylides,Shen and Lu reported in 2017 the missing monofluoromethyl sulfonium ylide 15,which was structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Reagent 15 is astable solid and can be stored for at least one month at ambient temperature on the bench without notable decomposition, and it can be prepared in as traightforward manner in good yields. [28d] They lide 15 was found to be av ery effective reagent for the electrophilic fluoromethylation of primary,s econdary, and tertiary alcohols,aswell as of malonic acid derivatives. [28d] It was shown that 15 is as trong alkylating agent. Thus,t he conversion of sulfonic acids,carboxylic acids,phenols,amides, and N-heteroarenes into the corresponding fluoromethyl derivatives takes place readily under mild conditions (Scheme 7). [28d] Although 15 is as trong alkylating agent, reactions of 15 with carbon nucleophiles and C À CH 2 Fb ond formation are problematic,and only proceed with special substrates. [28d]In 2008, Prakash and Olah developed ap owerful fluoromethylating agent that has been successfully applied in the fluoromethylation of numerous nucleophiles (Scheme 5). The fluoromethylsulfonium salt 13 is obtained in at hree-step synthesis with an overall yield of 60 %. [28b] Interestingly,t he first step-the synthesis of the fluoromethyl phenyl thioether-is reported with better yields in the literature. [5b] The sulfonium salt 13 is amoisture-insensitive solid;itis stable for several months in the solid state and is also stable in acetonitrile solution. However,i nD MF and THF,d ecomposition occurs. [28b] Substrates that possess heteroatoms as nucleophilic centers are readily fluoromethylated upon reaction with 13. In particular,fluoromethyl sulfonates can be prepared under mild conditions by using the sulfonium salt 13.H owever,i ts application to carbon nucleophiles has thus far remained limited to only afew compounds. [28b] 2. 1.4. N,N-(Dimethylamino)-S-phenyl-S-monofluoromethyl Phenyloxosulfonium Triflate Avery effective fluoromethylating reagent was developed in 2011 by Shibata and co-workers. [43] It shows ap ronounced preference for fluoroalkylation at oxygen atoms,w hich provides as ynthetic approach for the preparation of monofluoromethyl ethers.This method was applied to anumber of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds.I ti saregioselective reagent for b-keto esters and was successful also in the fluoromethylation of carboxylic and sulfonic acids,o xindole derivatives,a nd phenols,aswell as naphthols (Scheme 6). [17,43] Ad isadvantage of this reagent is its tedious,m ulti-step synthesis.H owever,w hen am odified procedure from the literature is used to simplify the synthesis of the fluoromethyl phenyl thioether intermediate, [44] the overall synthesis time can be reduced substantially from almost 9days to 1.5 days. [28b,43] Ther eagent 14 is as olid that is easy to handle and can be stored. [43] Although O-alkylation can also be performed well with other reagents,the E/Z stereoselectivity of 14 is particularly noteworthy.T he O-regiospecificity of 14 was explained by ar adical-like mechanism involving aS ET process. [45] However,S hen and co-workers reported that alcohols did not react with this reagent under the conditions applied. [28d] 2. 1.5. Monofluoromethyl-Substituted Sulfonium Ylides Completing the series of difluoromethyl-and trifluoromethyl-substituted sulfonium ylides,Shen and Lu reported in 2017 the missing monofluoromethyl sulfonium ylide 15,which was structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Reagent 15 is astable solid and can be stored for at least one month at ambient temperature on the bench without notable decomposition, and it can be prepared in as traightforward manner in good yields.

        <p>Because of their high instability,o rganometallic reagents such as fluoromethyllithium or the corresponding Grignard reagents belong to the most difficult areas of research on nucleophilic monofluoromethylating agents.

Furthermore,the reaction has to be quenched, and as olvent mixture of THF/Et 2 O( 1:1) has to be used. [46] Unfortunately, unlike MeLi, reagent 16 cannot be isolated at room temperature as decomposition occurs very quickly,most probably by elimination of LiF.Because of their high instability,o rganometallic reagents such as fluoromethyllithium or the corresponding Grignard reagents belong to the most difficult areas of research on nucleophilic monofluoromethylating agents.

[17, 28i,66] Thesynthesis of 23 has also been improved. Ac onvenient method for the preparation of 23 is the reaction of fluoromethyl phenyl sulfone (22)w ith phenylsulfonyl fluoride. [5c] Hu and Prakash reported that FBSM acts as anucleophilic fluoromethylating reagent and undergoes addition reactions with epoxides, [66a] aziridines, [62] a,b-unsaturated ketones, [62,67] alkynyl ketones, [62] and benzynes. [62] Shibata and Prakash found 22 to be an effective reagent in the palladium-catalyzed enantioselective fluoromethylation of allylic acetates,i mines,a nd a,b-unsaturated ketones and esters. [5b, 67] Further,t he fluoromethylation of alcohols,alkyl halides,and a,b-unsaturated ketones with 23 (using ac inchona alkaloid derived catalyst) has been reported. [7a,67b] Using an in situ formed iminium compound as the catalyst, Wang et al. reported an enantioselective addition of 23 to enals. [68] In the last ten years,some research groups have described the reaction of FBMS with aliphatic aldehydes resulting in enantioselective fluoromethylation in the bposition, [69] as well as the addition of FBMS to MBH carbonates or acetates yielding the products of an enantioselective asymmetric allylic alkylation (Scheme 16). [70] Gouverneur and co-workers showed that the palladium-catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction of 23 with Morita-Baylis-Hillmann (MBH) carbonates (allyl carbonates) proceeds with high regioselectivity. [71] Thea ddition to alkyl and benzyl halides also proceeds with high yields,a ss hown by Olah and coworkers. [72] Thef luoromethyl group is finally formed after reductive cleavage of the sulfonyl substituents with Mg in MeOH (Scheme 16). [70c, 71-73] Instead of the palladium catalyst, the combination of ac inchona alkaloid and FeCl 2 or ac inchona-catalyzed Mannich-type reaction can be used for enantioselective monofluoromethylation (Shibata and coworkers). [74] Furthermore,t he addition of 23 to carbonyl compounds, [69a] a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, [75] and functionalized alkynes [76] as well as the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary allylic fluorides by iridium-catalyzed allylic fluoromethylation with 23 have been described by the groups of Hu, Vesely,a nd Hartwig. [77] Reductive cleavage of the sulfonyl substituents to yield the corresponding fluoromethyl derivatives,asinthe other examples discussed above, was not reported.Since the discovery of fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (FBSM, 23)i n2 006 by Hu/Shibata and co-workers and its suitability as af luoromethylating agent, an umber of fluoromethylation reactions,including transition-metal-mediated cross-couplings,have been performed.

        <p>Thereaction of 23 with MBH carbonates (Toru and Tan) proceeds with high enantio-and diastereoselectivity and yields alcohols with afluoromethyl group in g-position to the OH group after workup. [74,78] Thei ntroduction of af luoro- methyl group in Ibuprofen by using 23 in place of the methyl group results in an increase in its inhibitory activity. [79] The reaction of secondary amines with formaldehyde in the presence of FBSM (Prakash et al.,2 013) opens up ag eneral and straightforward synthetic route to b-fluoro ethylamines. [80] Hu and co-workers reported in the same year that starting from tertiary amines,f urther b-fluoro ethylamines can be prepared by CÀCc oupling using 23 and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) as the coupling reagent (Scheme 17). [77b] In 2014, Ramos and Yang extended the addition reaction of FBSM to enals,providing an enantioselective synthesis for fluoroindane and fluorochromanol derivates (Scheme 18). [81] Shibata and co-workers reported an efficient method for preparing C2-aryl indoles with af luoromethyl group at the alkyl side chain starting from the corresponding aryl sulfonyl derivatives and replacing the SO 2 Ar substituent by CH 2 F, by utilizing 23 in the presence of ac hiral phase transfer catalyst. [82] Furthermore,the acetate group of allenyl acetates can be replaced with aCH 2 Fgroup by employing 23 (Ma and Lu), yielding the corresponding fluoromethyl allenes (Scheme 19). [83] FBSM is also the key reagent of ah ighly selective two-step synthesis of functionalized monofluoromethylated allenes,reported by Shibata and co-workers. [84] In the first step,2 -bromo-1,3-dienes react with FBSM in ap alladium-catalyzed nucleophilic substitution that selectively introduces the fluorobis(phenylsulfonyl)methyl group directly bonded to the allene skeleton. Thef ollowing reductive desulfonation (Mg,M eOH) gives the fluoromethyl allenes in excellent (81-83 %) yields. [84] An efficient synthesis of a-fluoromethyl alcohols has been reported by Prakash and Olah in 2012, using the related trimethylsilyl derivative 24.T his reagent contains aS iMe 3 group in place of the hydrogen atom of FBSM and is readily prepared from 23 by deprotonation with NaH and subsequent silylation with Me 3 SiCl (Scheme 20). [85] 3. 1.4. 2-Fluoro-1,3-benzothiole-1,1,3,3-tetraoxide Thec yclic version (FBDT) 25 of FBSM was reported in 2010 by Shibata and co-workers. [86] Reagent 25 is prepared starting from the corresponding methylene-bridged derivative by fluorination with Selectfluor and formed as acolorless solid. FBDT adds efficiently to the C=Ogroup of avariety of aldehydes yielding the corresponding a-fluoromethyl alcohols after workup.The addition is complete within 24 h. In the case of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes,1 ,2-addition competes with 1,4-addition, and the selectivity is strongly dependent on the base used (DABCO or pyrrolidone). [86] In the presence of bifunctional cinchona alkaloid derived thiourea titanium complexes,t he reaction of 25 with aldehydes becomes enantioselective (32-96 % ee)a nd yields the fluoromethyl alcohols in 73-91 %y ield (Scheme 21). [87] Thes tructure of FBDT (25)h as been determined in the solid state by singlecrystal X-ray diffraction. [86]Thereaction of 23 with MBH carbonates (Toru and Tan) proceeds with high enantio-and diastereoselectivity and yields alcohols with afluoromethyl group in g-position to the OH group after workup. [74,78] Thei ntroduction of af luoro- methyl group in Ibuprofen by using 23 in place of the methyl group results in an increase in its inhibitory activity. [79] The reaction of secondary amines with formaldehyde in the presence of FBSM (Prakash et al.,2 013) opens up ag eneral and straightforward synthetic route to b-fluoro ethylamines. [80] Hu and co-workers reported in the same year that starting from tertiary amines,f urther b-fluoro ethylamines can be prepared by CÀCc oupling using 23 and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) as the coupling reagent (Scheme 17). [77b] In 2014, Ramos and Yang extended the addition reaction of FBSM to enals,providing an enantioselective synthesis for fluoroindane and fluorochromanol derivates (Scheme 18). [81] Shibata and co-workers reported an efficient method for preparing C2-aryl indoles with af luoromethyl group at the alkyl side chain starting from the corresponding aryl sulfonyl derivatives and replacing the SO 2 Ar substituent by CH 2 F, by utilizing 23 in the presence of ac hiral phase transfer catalyst. [82] Furthermore,the acetate group of allenyl acetates can be replaced with aCH 2 Fgroup by employing 23 (Ma and Lu), yielding the corresponding fluoromethyl allenes (Scheme 19). [83] FBSM is also the key reagent of ah ighly selective two-step synthesis of functionalized monofluoromethylated allenes,reported by Shibata and co-workers.

        <p>Theu nique properties of organic molecules containing afluoromethyl (CH 2 F) group and their use in various fields of pharmacya nd medicine has resulted in ah igh demand for reagents that are capable of selectively introducing aC H 2 F group.Inrecent decades,great efforts have been made in the development of fluoromethylating reagents and several new reagents have been prepared and used. Most of the reagents are based on fluorohalomethanes and, more specifically, fluorochloromethane,o rd erivatives thereof.T he main synthetic strategies are the introduction of as uitable leaving group in place of the halogen (Cl, Br, I), or the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents at the carbon atom bonded to fluorine.Inthe former case,the CH 2 Fgroup is transferred as the electrophile.T he alkylation strengths of the reagents differ and can be fine-tuned by the nature of the respective leaving group.I nt he latter case,e lectron-withdrawing substituents (SO 2 Ar, PhCH 2 OC(O), PhS(O)NTBS) stabilize anegative charge at the carbon atom bonded to fluorine,and CH 2 Fisintroduced as anucleophile;the reagent can thus be considered as ar eplacement for the unstable and very sensitive FCH 2 Li. Over the last decade,p articular attention has been paid to reagents that are able to transfer the CH 2 F group by aradical pathway.The strategy behind this approach was again the introduction of suitable substituents at the carbon atom bonded to fluorine that favor radical formation.
