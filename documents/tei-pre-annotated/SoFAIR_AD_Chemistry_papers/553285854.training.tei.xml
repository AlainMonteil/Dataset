        <p>Skeletal editing involves making specific point-changes to the core of a molecule through the selective insertion, deletion or exchange of atoms. It thus represents a potentially powerful strategy for the step-economic modification of complex substrates and is a perfect complement to methods such as CÀ H functionalization that target the molecular periphery. Given their ubiquity in biologically active compounds, the ability to perform skeletal editing on -and therefore interconvert between -aromatic heterocycles is especially valuable. This review summarizes both recent and key historical examples of skeletal editing as applied to interconversion of aromatic rings; we anticipate that it will serve to highlight not only the innovative and enabling nature of current skeletal editing methods, but also the tremendous opportunities that still exist in the field.Skeletal editing involves making specific point-changes to the core of a molecule through the selective insertion, deletion or exchange of atoms.

        <p>Achieving the selective functionalization of complex molecules is a longstanding challenge that has -in equal measure -inspired and frustrated the efforts of countless synthetic chemists. The requirement that such functionalizations be both general and concise is particularly pressing in the field of drug discovery, where the accessibility of new chemical entities directly affects the speed and efficiency with which drug candidates can be identified. [1] It is in this context that the concept of 'molecular editing' has recently become a topic of great interest.Achieving the selective functionalization of complex molecules is a longstanding challenge that has -in equal measure -inspired and frustrated the efforts of countless synthetic chemists.

        <p>Molecular editing, also referred to as 'site-directed mutagenesis', [1] has been defined as 'the insertion, deletion, or exchange of atoms in highly functionalized compounds at will and in a highly specific fashion'. [2] Given this broad remit, which necessarily encompasses the field of late-stage functionalization, [3][4][5][6] the mantle of 'molecular editing' is applicable to myriad reactivity manifolds and can concern transformations in almost any region of chemical space. Understandably however, the majority of existing molecular editing methodologies target readily accessible functionality on the exterior of the substrate, [7][8][9] such that the core molecular skeleton is left untouched.Molecular editing, also referred to as 'site-directed mutagenesis', [1] has been defined as 'the insertion, deletion, or exchange of atoms in highly functionalized compounds at will and in a highly specific fashion'.

        <p>The ability to modify the core of a molecule by interconverting between (hetero)aromatic substructures is potentially extremely valuable due to their ubiquity in biologically active compounds. [10 -16] Although such transformations fall within the broader -and only recently defined -field of molecular editing, they include established concepts such as 'transannulation' [17] and have been referred to historically as 'heterocycle interconversions'. [18,19] In a 2022 review, Sarpong, Levin, and co-workers introduced another new term by defining 'skeletal editing' as the subset of 'molecular editing' that concerns the precise modification of molecular skeletons, mainly ring systems. [20] Such transformations promise to facilitate the rapid diversification of complex molecular architectures while avoiding cost-and labor-intensive de novo synthesis. As such, they have the potential to accelerate both drug discovery and total synthesis. [21] In this review, we provide an overview of skeletal editing as applied to the interconversion of (hetero)arenes. We seek to highlight not only contemporary examples of skeletal editing, but also key historical examples; transformations that generate an aromatic system from non-aromatic precursors, or that result in destruction of an aromatic system, are not discussed in detail.The ability to modify the core of a molecule by interconverting between (hetero)aromatic substructures is potentially extremely valuable due to their ubiquity in biologically active compounds.

        <p>Transformations are categorized by whether they involve 1) ring expansion, 2) ring contraction, or 3) an atom-exchange but with no net-change in the size of the (hetero)aromatic system. Ring expansions are necessarily accompanied by the insertion of new atoms and are thus further sub-divided by whether they involve a) insertion of a single C-or N-atom (while retaining all the original ring-atoms), or b) whether the expansion process involves exchange of one or more of the original ring-atoms for new atoms.Transformations are categorized by whether they involve 1) ring expansion, 2) ring contraction, or 3) an atom-exchange but with no net-change in the size of the (hetero)aromatic system.

        <p>While ring expansion reactions are ubiquitous in carbonyl chemistry, [22 -25] their application to aromatic systems is more limited due to the inherent stability of π-conjugated rings. Methodologies that insert new atoms into aromatic systems are therefore of great value for both 1) their conceptual rarity, and 2) their ability to significantly alter chemical reactivity and physicochemical properties. [11,14] The majority of ring expansion methodologies reported to date have concerned the insertion of C-or N-atoms, as outlined in the following sections.While ring expansion reactions are ubiquitous in carbonyl chemistry, [22 -25] their application to aromatic systems is more limited due to the inherent stability of π-conjugated rings.

        <p>One of the best-established ring expansions is the Buchner reaction (Scheme 1,A), first reported in 1885. [28,29] The transformation proceeds through cyclopropanation of the aromatic substrate with a diazoester, followed by 6π electrocyclic ring opening. In the initial incarnation of the methodology, cyclopropana-tion was achieved through thermal or photolytic activation of the diazoester and typically exhibited poor regioselectivity. However, in 1980 Noels and co- [26,27] workers reported a rhodium-catalyzed Buchner reaction which improved regioselectivity. [30,31] Subsequent advances have led to further improvements in both regioselectivity and reaction scope, [32 -35] and in 2017, a regio-and enantioselective variant was demonstrated in flow. [36] In 2022, Sarlah and co-workers reported the single C-atom insertion into polycyclic arenes through a dearomatization/cyclopropanation sequence (Scheme 1,B-i). [26] While the net transformation is similar to that of the Buchner reaction (Scheme 1,A), Sarlah's strategy avoids the regioselectivity issues that plague the earlier methodology. First, the areneophile MTAD (4-methyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione) undergoes [4 + 2] cycloaddition with a polycyclic arene under visible light irradiation. Cyclopropanation of the C(2)À C(3) position is now achievable on the isolated olefin by use of TMS-diazomethane and a palladium catalyst. Retro-[4 + 2] cycloaddition is then achieved through partial hydrolysis of the urazole, copper-catalyzed aerobic oxidation, and subsequent extrusion of dinitrogen. 6π Electrocyclization of the resulting cyclopropanated arene then affords the ring expanded benzocycloheptatriene. The reaction was applied to a range of substituted naphthalenes as well as quinolines and benzoquinolines. Earlier work by the group applied a similar concept to the synthesis of 3benzoxepines through manganese-catalyzed epoxidation of the intermediate cycloadduct (Scheme 1,B-ii). [27] The impact of ring expansion on a molecule's properties is particularly drastic when the substrate and/or the insertive reagent contain heteroatoms. For example, despite differing by only a single C-atom, indole and quinoline possess vastly different chemical and physicochemical properties: where the former is a weak acid that readily undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution, the latter is weakly basic and is predisposed to nucleophilic aromatic substitution. [37] Historically, the one-carbon expansion of both pyrroles and indoles has been achieved using the Ciamician -Dennstedt reaction (Scheme 2,A), first reported in 1881. [38] This occurs through generation of a dihalocarbene from the corresponding haloform in basic media, azole cyclopropanation, and subsequent fragmentation. Despite the appeal of the net chemical transformation, the competing Reimer -Tiemann formylation often leads to low yields of the desired azine (up to ca 40 %) and the strongly basic conditions for generation of the carbene limit functional group compatibility. [39,45] A modified Ciamician -Dennstedt reaction employing sodium trichloroacetate as a thermally-activated dichlorocarbene source was re-ported by Dai and co-workers in 2021 as part of the total synthesis of lycopodium alkaloids, affording the desired 3-chloropyridine in a 31 % yield (Scheme 2,B). [40] In 2015, Bonge-Hansen and co-workers reported a rhodium-catalyzed variant of the Ciamician -Dennstedt reaction in which indoles are converted to quinoline-3-carboxylates using halodiazoacetates as the carbenoid precursor (Scheme 2,C-i). [41] Although readily accessible, the requisite halodiazoacetates are unstable at ambient temperatures. [46] The need for an electron withdrawing substituent on the diazo reagent to achieve even this modest level of stability necessarily restricts the ring expansion to installation of esters on the 3-position of the resulting quinoline. Despite this limitation, the reaction afforded high yields across a range of indole substrates. No reaction was observed when the indole nitrogen was protected with a Boc group, and methylation of the indole nitrogen resulted in the formation of a dimeric C(3)-alkylated product (Scheme 2,C-ii). The same ring expansion methodology was later applied to 3-chloroindoles to generate the 4chloroquinoline-3-carboxylates, which could be hydrolyzed to afford the corresponding 4-quinolone (Scheme 2,D). [42] This strategy was utilized in the synthesis of norfloxacin from 5,6-difluoro-3-chloroindole.One of the best-established ring expansions is the Buchner reaction (Scheme 1,A), first reported in 1885.

        <p>In 2021, Levin and co-workers reported that arylchlorodiazirines can serve as carbene precursors for the ring expansion of indoles and pyrroles into the corresponding 3-arylazines (Scheme 2,E-i). [43] Chlorodiazirines are prepared conveniently by Graham oxidation of amidinium salts; [47] while still energetic materials, [48] they are more stable than the isomeric diazo compounds and can therefore be used to install aryl moieties. Although a range of functionality on the indole and diazirine was well tolerated, a substituent in the 2-position of the indole was required for high yields. In the absence of a 2-substituent, the quinoline product undergoes a deleterious addition into the free carbene, [49] both decomposing the desired product and consuming the carbene. Additionally, a superstoichiometric base was required to sequester the chloride anion co-product, which would otherwise also consume the carbene. Despite these limitations, the protocol is applicable to complex substrates and has been employed in tryptophan editing as well as in the synthesis of quinoline cyclophanes (Scheme 2,E-ii). In the case of pyrroles, the regioselectivity of cyclopropanation -and therefore of C-atom insertion -is determined by the steric profile of the 2-and 6positions (Scheme 2,E-iii). Atom insertion preferentially occurs adjacent to the smaller substituent, although Scheme 2. Ring expansion of azoles and diazoles through C-atom insertion.

        <p>this steric control is overruled by the presence of Hbond donors, which guide insertion adjacent to themselves.

        <p>In addition to the ring expansion of indoles, Levin demonstrated that the ring expansion of pyrazoles and indazoles could also be achieved using chlorodiazirines (Scheme 2,F). [44] This reaction is proposed to proceed through formation of an ylide intermediate which then fragments with NÀ N cleavage through an electrocyclic ring-opening (Scheme 2,F-i). The resulting diazahexatriene undergoes ring closure with loss of HCl to afford the desired pyrimidine or quinazoline. The reaction tolerates several functional groups, including free alcohols, and has been applied to the modification of preexisting drug motifs and the synthesis of a rosuvastatin analog (Scheme 2,F-ii). It was noted that, if the starting diazole is too electron-poor, competitive dimerization can occur to give bis(pyrazolyl)methanes. This side-reaction was suppressed by using a 2-trimethylsilylethoxymethyl (SEM) protected substrate. Two major limitations were observed in the reaction scope: substrates with poor solubility in the MTBE solvent, and substrates bearing inductively electron-withdrawing substituents.In addition to the ring expansion of indoles, Levin demonstrated that the ring expansion of pyrazoles and indazoles could also be achieved using chlorodiazirines (Scheme 2,F).

        <p>While the reactions illustrated in Scheme 2,A -2,E exploit a halocyclopropanated azole to enable spontaneous ring expansion, Reiser and co-workers have shown that cyclopropanated azoles without a pendant nucleofuge can be opened through a palladiumcatalyzed Heck-type arylation (Scheme 3). [50] Following regioselective carbopalladation, the reaction was proposed to proceed through ring opening and palladium migration to give a ring-expanded tetrahydropyridinyl palladium species. A postulated base-assisted elimination then affords the 2-aryl dihydropyridine product and regenerates the catalyst; in situ oxidation with DDQ affords the 2-aryl pyridine, providing a novel solution to the '2-pyridyl problem' that plagues Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling. [51] Although the 3substituent is limited by the nature of the diazoreagent required in the initial cyclopropanation, the reaction exhibits good compatibility with a number of substituted (hetero)aryl halides. Additionally, the reaction was applied to the synthesis of dihydropyrans from the monocyclopropanated furans with only minor adjustments to the reaction conditions.While the reactions illustrated in Scheme 2,A -2,E exploit a halocyclopropanated azole to enable spontaneous ring expansion, Reiser and co-workers have shown that cyclopropanated azoles without a pendant nucleofuge can be opened through a palladiumcatalyzed Heck-type arylation (Scheme 3).

        <p>A conceptually similar, but much more general, Natom insertion protocol has been developed recently by Morandi and co-workers for the conversion of indoles to quinazolines (Scheme 4,B-i). [55] In contrast to Kumar's methodology, [54] this reaction employs an in situ generated iodonitrene to achieve aziridination, which is proposed to occur in a stepwise fashion via a cationic intermediate. Subsequent fragmentation and expulsion of the iodobenzene nucleofuge affords the quinazoline product. A silyl protecting group was found to be crucial in preventing interaction of the nitrene with the indole NÀ H, stabilizing the cationic species generated by reaction with the nitrene, and finally acting as a sufficient electrofuge to release the free quinazoline product.A conceptually similar, but much more general, Natom insertion protocol has been developed recently by Morandi and co-workers for the conversion of indoles to quinazolines (Scheme 4,B-i).

        <p>Interestingly, when the methodology was applied to indoles bearing medium-sized 2,3-fused rings, the isomeric quinoxaline product was observed in high yields (Scheme 4,B-iii). It was proposed that the high strain imposed by the fused ring prevented direct fragmentation of the aziridine to the quinazoline.

        <p>Strategies for ring expansion through N-atom insertion are not limited to aziridination chemistry. [57] In 1971, Maeda and co-workers reported the synthesis of s-triazines from imidazoles in which N-atom insertion is achieved through an oxidative cleavage/ condensation sequence (Scheme 5,A). [58] In this protocol, irradiation in the presence of methylene blue and oxygen resulted in oxidative cleavage of the imidazole C=C bond to give an amidoaldehyde intermediate. Condensation of both carbonyls with ammonia closed the ring to generate the triazine. This approach was later employed in the conversion of indoles to quinazolines (Scheme 5,B), which provided insight into the mechanism of the transformation. [59] Electrochemistry has also emerged as a promising tool for skeletal editing due to its high atom economy and functional group tolerance. [60][61][62][63][64] In 2022, Cheng and co-workers reported the electrochemically-mediated insertion of ammonia into aromatic carbocycles to afford the corresponding isoquinoline (Scheme 6,i). [65] The reaction achieved over 99 % theoretical atom economy, and is proposed to proceed through oxidative aziridination with ammonia followed by oxidative ring opening and rearomatization. While most substrates investigated were non-aromatic indenes, the method has been applied to aromatic systems (Scheme 6,ii). Thus, following conversion of a Hantzsch ester to a polysubstituted pyrrole through sequential electrochemical reduction and electrochemical atom deletion, N-atom insertion afforded the pyrimidine product. Although the overall yield was modest (12 %), all steps were telescoped, and the only by-products were AcOEt and H 2 .Strategies for ring expansion through N-atom insertion are not limited to aziridination chemistry.

        <p>A particularly well-explored approach to the expansion of ring systems is through [4 + 2] cycloaddition/retrocycloaddition. [66] When such reactions employ fivemembered heterocycles as the 4π-component, two new atoms are installed from the dienophile at the expense of one ring-atom of the substrate. The ring expansion process is thus accompanied by an atom exchange process. Scheme 5. Ring expansion/N-atom insertion through oxidative cleavage of: A) imidazoles, and B) indoles. [58,59] Scheme 6.

        <p>Oxazoles have been shown to be valuable substrates for these transformations. [66] For example, reaction of an oxazole with benzyne and subsequent acidolysis of the oxa-bridged bicyclic intermediate leads to the ring expanded isoquinoline (Scheme 7,A). [67,68] Like oxazoles, isoxazoles can also undergo ring expansions through [4 + 2] cycloaddition. In 2022, Odom and co-workers reported the transformation of isoxazoles into pyridines through an inverse electrondemand Diels-Alder reaction (IEDDA; Scheme 7,B). [69] Here, expansion of the ring is accompanied by formal exchange of an O-atom for two C-atoms. This process proceeds through a regioselective Lewis acid-promoted [4 + 2] cycloaddition of the isoxazole with an enamine, resulting in a [2.2.1]-oxazabicyclic intermediate. Two alternative Lewis acid-promoted pathways were proposed for the formation of the pyridine Noxide product: loss of the enamine-derived amine followed by ring opening, or the reverse. Addition of metallic titanium then reduces the pyridine N-oxide to the desired pyridine. An investigation of substrate scope demonstrated the applicability of this methodology to the synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines.Oxazoles have been shown to be valuable substrates for these transformations.

[70] Specifically, [4 + 2] cycloaddition of 1-aminopyrroles with electron-deficient alkynes and subsequent extrusion of an aminonitrene affords the ring expanded benzenoid. This strategy can be applied to both simple and 2,3-fused pyrroles, but is very sensitive to the electronic properties of the substrate. It has been employed in the total synthesis of juncusol.

[72] Here, insertion of both a C-and an N-atom from a 2-azidoketone was accompanied by loss of an O-atom from the benzisoxazole substrate. The proposed mechanism involves the formation of a rhodium-bound ketoimine by loss of dinitrogen, prior to aza-[4 + 2] cycloaddition with the benzisoxazole.

        <p>A photoredox catalyzed annulation of thiophenes to afford benzene derivatives was reported by Chiang, Lei, and co-workers in 2019 (Scheme 9). [73] This marks a significant practical advance on the thiophene transannulations reported previously under thermal [74] and UV-photolysis [75] conditions. While following a similar overall mechanism to the (is)oxazole and pyrrole Diels-Alder transannulations (Scheme 7), Chiang and Lei's methodology is proposed to involve [4 + 2] cycloaddition of radical cation species (Scheme 9,iii). First, the excited acridinium photocatalyst undergoes single electron transfer (SET) with thiophene to generate a thiophenyl radical cation. A [4 + 2] cycloaddition affords an annulated radical cation, which is then reduced by SET from the photocatalyst. Extrusion of molecular sulfur from the cycloadduct affords the ring expanded arene. In addition to thiophenes, selenophenes were also shown to undergo the transformation with extrusion of atomic selenium. Scheme 7.

        <p>Despite the appeal of these early reports, their practical utility is limited by modest substrate scope and yields. However, in 2022 the ring contraction of quinoline N-oxides was generalized and optimized for a broad range of substrates by Levin and co-workers (Scheme 11,C-i). [79] By employing narrow-band 390 nm light, 2-substituted quinoline N-oxides could be transformed selectively into the corresponding 3,1-benzoxazepines without competition from deleterious twophoton processes. In situ acidolysis promoted both the ring opening and the subsequent ring contraction to form 1-acylindoles (Scheme 11,C-ii). The reaction was applied to a number of highly functionalized molecules, such as the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast (Scheme 11,C-iii) and was shown to tolerate different heterocyclic substrates including 1,8naphthyridines and quinoxalines.Despite the appeal of these early reports, their practical utility is limited by modest substrate scope and yields.

        <p>Ring contraction through C-atom deletion has also been reported by Sarpong and co-workers (Scheme 12). [84] This method transforms six-membered pyrimidines to five-membered pyrazoles by a ring opening/condensation strategy. Initial reaction with triflic anhydride activates the substrate towards nucleophilic attack from hydrazine. The subsequent intermediate then undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrange-ment, resulting in a ring-opened species analogous to a Zincke intermediate. Tautomerization followed by ring closure gives the desired five-membered ring and rearomatization by expulsion of the amidine nucleofuge affords the pyrazole product. The reaction was found to tolerate a broad range of functional groups on both the pyrimidine core and peripheral groups and has been employed in the late-stage modification of drug molecules such as rivaroxaban and in the synthesis of an intermediate of functionalized celecoxib.Ring contraction through C-atom deletion has also been reported by Sarpong and co-workers (Scheme 12).

        <p>One of the most common atom exchange transformations made in aromatic systems is the formation of Katritzky salts by condensation of an amine with a pyrylium salt (Scheme 13,A).

Light-mediated transannulation of thiophenes to benzenes with mechanistic insight and representative functionalized examples. [73] Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl. nium salts have been engaged in S N Ar processes that ultimately displace the aniline-derived nitrogen. [95,96] Another well-established instance of atom exchange is the Dimroth rearrangement (Scheme 13,B). [85] In this case, rather than one atom being exchanged for a different element, one N-atom is typically exchanged for another N-atom already present in the molecule. There are two classes of Dimroth rearrangement: type 1 involves the ring opening of amino-triazoles to imidoyl-diazo compounds, in which rotation of the diazomethyl group and subsequent recyclization affords the atom-exchanged product (Scheme 13,B-i). Type 2 involves the exchange of exocyclic and endocyclic N-atoms in six-membered heterocycles (Scheme 13,B-ii). Type 1 rearrangements are typically promoted by heating, whereas type 2 rearrangements often require a nucleophilic base such as hydroxide or alkoxides to occur. Scheme 11. Ring contraction strategies. A) Initial ring expansion of quinoline N-oxides/amides enables subsequent ring contraction. B) Light-mediated ring contraction of benzoxazepines to 3-formylindoles. [77,78] C) Ring contraction of quinolone N-oxides through benzoxazepines. [79] D) Ring expansion of quinolone N-amides to benzodiazepines and ring contraction to 1-acylindoles. [80] E) Ring contraction of quinazoline N-amides to indazoles. [81] As discussed in the context of ring expansion chemistry, sequences of [4 + 2] cycloadditions/retrocycloadditions allow for atom exchanges within aromatic ring systems. A common transformation of this type is based on the IEDDA reaction of tetrazines or triazines. [86] For example, reaction of a 1,2,4,5tetrazine with an alkene or alkyne simultaneously exchanges two N-atoms for C-atoms (Scheme 13,C). If an alkyne is used as the dienophile, the immediate product is aromatic, and no additional oxidation step is required to reach the pyridazine. The IEDDA reactions of tetrazines have become powerful tools for bio-orthogonal functionalization of biomolecules, [97] and have been reviewed extensively elsewhere. [66,86,98] Similar in concept, 2-pyrones are able to undergo IEDDA reactions to exchange a C-and O-atom for two C-atoms with release of CO 2 . [99,100] Atom exchanges of dibenzothiophenes have been reasonably well developed, [101] as described in recent reviews. [102,103] For example, Yorimitsu and co-workers have reported a series of methods that rely on oxidation of a dibenzothiophene to the corresponding S,S-dioxide to enable sequential S N Ar displacement of the S-atom (Scheme 13,D-i). [87 -89] By combining it with an initial Diels-Alder reaction between a 1,1-dioxobenzothiophene and an isobenzofuran, this strategy has been applied to the synthesis of π-extended carbazoles (Scheme 13,D-ii). [87] Recent work by Burns and co-workers reported the light-mediated conversion of aryl azides to amino-pyridines, which represents formal exchange of a benzenoid C-atom for a N-atom (Scheme 14). [104] The reaction is based on the known ability of an arylnitrene -accessed here by photolysis of an arylazide -to insert into the adjacent arene π-bond, initially forming a strained 2H-azirine. [105,106] A thermal 6π electrocyclic ring opening affords a cyclic ketenimine that reacts with the amine additive, before tautomerism generates a stable 2-aminoazepine. The required ring contraction [107 -110] is triggered by reaction with photochemically-generated singlet oxygen, which undergoes a [4 + 2] cycloaddition to give a peroxy-bridged intermediate. Subsequent ring opening gives the exocyclic peroxide and a 6π electrocyclization affords a Wheland-type intermediate that is quenched by solvolytic deformylation. Mechanistic investigations provided evidence for the Wheland intermediate as well as the selectivity for deletion of carbons meta to the initial azido group. The reverse Nto-C atom exchange with concomitant CÀ H amination was reported by Morofuji, Kano and co-workers in 2021 (Scheme 15). [111] Like in the O-to-N exchange of Katritzky salts, a key ring opened intermediate is required. This is achieved by quaternization of the pyridine substrate through S N Ar, followed by addition of a secondary amine to afford the ring opened intermediate. The key carbon insertion step is achieved by reaction with trimethylsulfinium ylide, providing an enamine which undergoes 6π electrocyclization. Elimination of an amine then affords the aniline product.One of the most common atom exchange transformations made in aromatic systems is the formation of Katritzky salts by condensation of an amine with a pyrylium salt (Scheme 13,A).

The IEDDA reactions of tetrazines have become powerful tools for bio-orthogonal functionalization of biomolecules, [97] and have been reviewed extensively elsewhere. [66,86,98] Similar in concept, 2-pyrones are able to undergo IEDDA reactions to exchange a C-and O-atom for two C-atoms with release of CO 2 . [99,100] Atom exchanges of dibenzothiophenes have been reasonably well developed, [101] as described in recent reviews. [102,103] For example, Yorimitsu and co-workers have reported a series of methods that rely on oxidation of a dibenzothiophene to the corresponding S,S-dioxide to enable sequential S N Ar displacement of the S-atom (Scheme 13,D-i). [87 -89] By combining it with an initial Diels-Alder reaction between a 1,1-dioxobenzothiophene and an isobenzofuran, this strategy has been applied to the synthesis of π-extended carbazoles (Scheme 13,D-ii). [87] Recent work by Burns and co-workers reported the light-mediated conversion of aryl azides to amino-pyridines, which represents formal exchange of a benzenoid C-atom for a N-atom (Scheme 14). [104] The reaction is based on the known ability of an arylnitrene -accessed here by photolysis of an arylazide -to insert into the adjacent arene π-bond, initially forming a strained 2H-azirine. [105,106] A thermal 6π electrocyclic ring opening affords a cyclic ketenimine that reacts with the amine additive, before tautomerism generates a stable 2-aminoazepine. The required ring contraction [107 -110] is triggered by reaction with photochemically-generated singlet oxygen, which undergoes a [4 + 2] cycloaddition to give a peroxy-bridged intermediate. Subsequent ring opening gives the exocyclic peroxide and a 6π electrocyclization affords a Wheland-type intermediate that is quenched by solvolytic deformylation. Mechanistic investigations provided evidence for the Wheland intermediate as well as the selectivity for deletion of carbons meta to the initial azido group. The reverse Nto-C atom exchange with concomitant CÀ H amination was reported by Morofuji, Kano and co-workers in 2021 (Scheme 15). [111] Like in the O-to-N exchange of Katritzky salts, a key ring opened intermediate is required. This is achieved by quaternization of the pyridine substrate through S N Ar, followed by addition of a secondary amine to afford the ring opened intermediate. The key carbon insertion step is achieved by reaction with trimethylsulfinium ylide, providing an enamine which undergoes 6π electrocyclization. Elimination of an amine then affords the aniline product.</p>
        <p>N-to-C atom exchange has also been reported by Mindiola and co-workers (Scheme 16). [112] The protocol employs as stoichiometric titanium complex (generated in situ) to insert into the aromatic skeleton, forming a seven-membered aza-titanacycle. Addition of TMSCl as an electrophile initiates release of a titanium-imide complex and insertion of the tert-butyl carbynyl group to form the aromatic carbocycle. The transient titanium alkylidene required for the insertion can then be regenerated over five steps.N-to-C atom exchange has also been reported by Mindiola and co-workers (Scheme 16).

        <p>Another well explored class of atom exchange is the denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3-triazoles and 1,2,3,4-tetrazoles (Scheme 17). [115] These compounds exist in an equilibrium of a closed-and open-form. It is from this open form that radical denitrogenation can occur in the presence of a metal catalyst such as cobalt-porphyrins. The resulting carbon-(for triazoles) or nitrogen-centered radical (for tetrazoles) can attack alkynes or nitriles that then cyclizes to give the atomexchanged product. In addition to sp-centers, a copper-catalyzed variant employs primary amines or Scheme 12. C-Atom deletion of pyrimidines to pyrazoles by ring-opening/hydrazine condensation. [84] Scheme 13. Strategies for atom exchange. A) Synthesis of Katritzky salts and the proposed mechanism. B) Representative examples of the Dimroth rearrangement.

        <p>Despite only having entered the chemical lexicon in recent years, the term 'skeletal editing' can be applied retrospectively to numerous decades-old methodologies and encompasses the well-established concept of heterocycle interconversion. [18,19] As highlighted in this Review, there is a significant and ever-growing suite of strategies available for the skeletal editing of aromatic systems, whether by selective ring expansion, ring contraction or atom exchange. By building on historical foundations, recent works have made particular contributions to reaction scope and functional group tolerance and have increasingly demonstrated applicability to complex substrates. However, the litmus-test will be whether the emerging methods find independent application in target-oriented synthesis -for example total synthesis or drug discovery -such that Scheme 14. C-to-N-Atom exchange of phenylazides to aminopyridines. [104] Scheme 15. Conversion of pyridines to anilines through N-to-C atom exchange. [111] Scheme 16. Ti-mediated N-to-C atom exchange for the conversion of pyridines to benzenoids. [112] the field can fulfil its potential as a powerful tool for rapid, site-specific molecular diversification.Despite only having entered the chemical lexicon in recent years, the term 'skeletal editing' can be applied retrospectively to numerous decades-old methodologies and encompasses the well-established concept of heterocycle interconversion.
