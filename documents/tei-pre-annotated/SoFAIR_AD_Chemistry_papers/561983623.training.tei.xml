[24] The partial charge distribution on the organic ligands was obtained from fitting the electrostatic potential in the DFT calculations. The metal ions and protic groups (water and oxo bridges) were parameterized, as described elsewhere.

        <p>Although it is reasonable to assume strong interactions between high-valencec ationic metal ions (e.g.,Z r IV ,T i IV ,C r III ,a nd Al III )a nd carboxylate ligands, this rather oversimplification of the complexs ituation in aqueous mediumt ends to overlook the formation of metal hydrates (MÀOH 2 )u pon contact of MOFs with water molecules. This generalization leads to an oversight of the commonly known formation of acidic hydrates of highly cationic metal ionsi na queous solution. Moreover,i f the coordinated water molecules are sufficiently polarized (acidic), facilitating auto-deprotonation, even at neutral pH, the generated hydroxyl ions are expectedt oh ave stronger basic character than that of carboxylate ions. In such as cenario, the assumption of HAHB interactions in play is highly plausible, but it is the hydroxyl ions, with more localizedn egative charge,t hat should be regarded as the hard base, rather than the commonly postulated bridging or monodentate carboxylate ions, where charged elocalization is operative to av ariable degree. Therefore, we propose that simply assigning the water stabilityo fM OFs containing high-valencem etal ions (bestr epresented by UiO-66 and MIL-101)t oH AHB interactions between carboxylate ions and high-valence metal cations is not an accurate model to capture the fundamentals for such observed water stability.

The calculated pK a values for the Zr-bridging oxygen species demonstrater ather interesting behavior (Figure 1a), through which the bridging oxides tend to have a very low pK a values, which indicate that they maintain a À2 formal chargeo ver the whole range of pH from 0t o1 4. However,t he bridgingh ydroxyl ions demonstrated successive pK a values( 0, 2.3, 6, and 8.6). It is proposed herein that deprotona-tion of the bridging hydroxyl ions in the Zr clusterd oes not lead to direct dissociation of the cluster, but rather to weakening of the interactions with the carboxylate linkers, as the cluster overall chargeb ecomes less positive. In this regards, the Zrcluster can be regarded as ap riorih ydroxylated species, making them more resistant to water hydrolysis. In line with pK a calculations, we propose that UiO-66 hydrolysis in basic mediumc ommencesm ainly through dissociation of the metal-carboxylate bonds, which is induced by ab uildup of negative chargeo nt he Zr oxide clusters. This proposed mechanism can be distinguished from ad ifferentm odel proposed above for hydrolysis of other MOFs with different cluster chemistry (those with open metal sites prone to water coordination).

Thec alculated pK a for the Cr-coordinated water molecules was found to be 6.5 (Figure 1d,e). This rather low pK a value suggestst hat, even under neutralp Hc onditions, as ignificant percentage of the MIL-101-Cr clusters is expected to contain hydroxyl ions coordinated to the Cr metal sites, which impart anionic character to the framework in an eutral pH aqueous solution.

[29] It is noted heret hat hydroxyl coordinationt oC ri ons did not adversely affect the cluster configuration( Figure 1f), which suggested that deprotonation of coordinated water molecules mostly affectedt he overall chargeo nt he clustera nd not the Cr carboxylate/oxide connectivity.T he negative-charge buildup on the Cr acetate cluster can destabilize the Cr carboxylate bondingb ya ltering the charged ensity at the metal ions, and thus, weakent he electrostatic interactions with the linkers,p roviding ar oute for scaffold breakdown in neutralt ob asic media, similar to that proposed for UiO-66.

The mechanism of MOF degradation in acidic medium, similart o that proposed for UiO-66, is also assumed to be operative here. The high-valence Cr III metal ion is expected to bind efficiently to the carboxylate anions, as expected from the HAHB principle, and only if the equilibrium is sensibly shifted towards decomposition products of the free carboxylic acidf orm can degradation of the MOF be observed.</p>
        <p>Our focus herein is directed towards investigating the known instability of two widely known MOFs, HKUST-1a nd MOF-5. We propose that degradation of the MOF structure in these two cases passes through an initial hydrations tep, involving coordination of water molecules to the metal ions. In the case of HKUST-1, axial water coordination to the Cu acetate paddlewheel is commonly known.F or the basic zinc acetate cluster encountered in MOF-5, Zn II hydration can occur if the tetrahedrally coordinated Zn II ion expands its coordination number to form ad istorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination sphere aroundt he Zn II ion. [30] In as ubsequents tep, auto-deprotonation of the metal-coordinated water molecule can readily form am etal hydroxide, which triggers ad ownhill pathway for restructuring of the metal carboxylate cluster, and hence, overall MOF degradation.I ti st hereforep aramount to gain an insight into the pK a of such metal-coordinated water molecules to better assess the significance of this proposed pathway.Our focus herein is directed towards investigating the known instability of two widely known MOFs, HKUST-1a nd MOF-5.

        <p>Our results strongly indicate the facile formation of metal hydroxides upon metal hydration at moderate pH values for such soft metal ions. Zn II and Cu II are the mostc ommon node types in Zn acetate and Cu paddlewheels, respectively.I nn eutral to even slightly acidic solution, the formation of CuÀOH À from autoprotolysis of coordinated water molecules is expected, based on ac alculated pK a value of 6.2 for the Cu II -coordinated water molecule (Figure 2a). Additionally in aqueouss olutionsa tp H&gt; 4, considerable buildup of negative chargeo n Cu-coordinated water molecules is expected (Figure 2a). The geometry-optimized structure of the Cu paddlewheel after formal deprotonation of one coordinated water moleculed emonstrates major structural deformation relative to that of the initial structure (Figure 2b). The two main observed changes were 1) dissociation of aC u II -carboxylate bond for Cu II bearing the hydroxyl ion, and 2) induced structuralc hanges in the coordination spherea round the second Cu II ion where as quareplanar coordination geometry was observed insteado ft he originals quarep yramidal configuration. The former change demonstrates one plausible pathway towards structural degradation of HKUST-1 in aqueous media, whereas the latter is particularly significant because it mighth elp to explain certain observations made elsewhere, in which rapid deterioration of HKUST-1 performance as am icroporous sorbent for certain gas molecules can be affected by exposure to moisture.
