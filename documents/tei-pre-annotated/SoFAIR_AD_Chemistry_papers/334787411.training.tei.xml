        <p>One of the challenges faced by modern society is the realization of a circular economy for polymer products. A bottleneck is the understanding of (co)polymer synthesis and degradation routes on a chain-by-chain basis, as the location of specific functional groups or structural defects determines the distributed chemical nature of the macrospecies involved and thus the reaction possibilities and macroscopic properties. Here we present a unified matrix-based elementary step driven kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) strategy to fully connect polymer synthesis and subsequent degradation at the molecular level, aiming at the recovery of the original monomer or a product spectrum of oligomers either degradable or upcyclable to high-added value products. This kMC strategy is illustrated for radical polymerization with methyl methacrylate (MMA) as the main monomer, selecting two case studies: (i) radical polymerization of MMA and the subsequent thermal degradation back to this monomer; and (ii) radical copolymerization of MMA with 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane (MDO) and the subsequent hydrolysis of the resulting poly(MMA-MDO) toward biodegradable oligomers. For the first case study, it is shown that the shape and location of the log-molar mass distribution strongly affects the degradation efficiency. For the second case study, it is highlighted that the inherent molecular heterogeneity of copolymers strongly defines the framework in which degradation synthesis routes can be exploited.One of the challenges faced by modern society is the realization of a circular economy for polymer products.

        <p>Free radical polymerization (FRP) of vinyl monomers has been a cornerstone of the polymer industry during the last century, mainly thanks to its robustness to oxygen and impurities, and its short reaction times, which range from minute to hour scale. 1,2 Recently, due to the growing environmental awareness, industry has shown interest in recycling FRP products. 3,4 Examples of recyclable products are poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) materials, which are often used as glass substitutes (e.g. face protection) due to their transparency and excellent optical properties. 5,6 Thermochemical recycling of PMMA at elevated temperature is specifically interesting because of the high monomer recovery (&gt; 90%), which is quite unique for vinyl polymers. 7 The reason is that PMMA degrades mainly through fast consecutive radically induced depropagation reactions or so-called unzipping, [8][9][10] which produces ideally MMA at the end of each unzipping cycle. The radicals are formed by an initiation mechanism usually involving specific structural defects formed during the PMMA synthesis. Examples are head-to-head defects and unsaturated chain ends following from termination by recombination and disproportionation respectively. [11][12][13][14][15] The head-to-head defects alternatively follow from less common head-to-head additions.Free radical polymerization (FRP) of vinyl monomers has been a cornerstone of the polymer industry during the last century, mainly thanks to its robustness to oxygen and impurities, and its short reaction times, which range from minute to hour scale. 1,2 Recently, due to the growing environmental awareness, industry has shown interest in recycling FRP products. 3,4 Examples of recyclable products are poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) materials, which are often used as glass substitutes (e.g. face protection) due to their transparency and excellent optical properties. 5,6 Thermochemical recycling of PMMA at elevated temperature is specifically interesting because of the high monomer recovery (&gt; 90%), which is quite unique for vinyl polymers. 7 The reason is that PMMA degrades mainly through fast consecutive radically induced depropagation reactions or so-called unzipping, [8][9][10] which produces ideally MMA at the end of each unzipping cycle.

        <p>One can imagine that the location and concentrations of these structural defects, in general functional groups, has an immense effect on the thermal PMMA degradation kinetics, as a certain thermal energy is only capable to break/alter certain chemical bonds/moieties. The exact thermal degradation reaction mechanism -even for virgin PMMA -is still under debate. 6 Most researchers adopt the multi-step degradation mechanism originally proposed by Kashiwagi et al. 11,12,16 because it is the most straightforward mechanism to predict thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements, in which mass losses are recorded for a given heating rate. With increasing temperature it is claimed that one observes unzipping by initiation through head-to-head fission (see red star in Figure 1), unsaturated end-chain fission, and head-to-tail fission, as supported by many TGA results displaying three dominant peaks and thus three cycles of mass losses. 17,18 A fine tuning as proposed by Manring [13][14][15]19 considers the interplay of chemical reactions and molecular diffusion, favoring degradation reactions leading to small radicals which are inherently more mobile. 20,21 Figure 1: Circularity for vinyl polymers with the upper branch free radical polymerization (FRP) and the lower branch the thermochemical recycling or thermal degradation aiming at monomer recovery. Focus is on linear polymer poly(methyl methacrylate (PMMA). The spheres indicated in red are examples of a structural defect at which degradation can be initiated; only termination by recombination is shown Manring also put forward that radicals of a general source (e.g. through a hydrogen abstraction based on an impurity) can add to unsaturated end-chain ends, leading to an alternative initiation mechanism. This need of extra initiation mechanisms to unravel PMMA thermal degradation kinetics follows from the observation that sometimes four instead of three peaks are witnessed in TGA analysis. 6,8,22,23 A challenge is thus the linkage of PMMA synthesis by FRP on the elementary reaction level to the follow-up thermochemical recycling still at this elementary reaction level in view of the implementation of circularity for polyacrylics, as conceptually highlighted in Figure 1. Essential is the consideration of the dominant reaction pathways depending on the specific experimental synthesis and thermochemical recycling conditions. This direction toward chemically oriented research for chemical recycling goes hand in hand with the development of new (bio)degradable polymers as well. A challenge here is to incorporate biodegradable groups in vinyl polymer synthesis, benefiting from the progress in the field of biopolymers, more specifically the synthesis of aliphatic polyesters such as polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactide (PLA) and polyglycolide (PGA) as typically synthesized by ring opening polymerization (ROP). 24,25 The major drawback of these polymers is that their application scope is rather limited and that ROP generally demands more stringent synthetic conditions with respect to pressure and temperature. 25,26 Hence, recent attempts in the polymer chemistry community have combined the best of both worlds, i.e. the development of vinyl pseudo-homopolymers with (bio)degradable ester linkages has been explored through radical ROP of vinyl monomers with cyclic ketene acetal monomers (CKA's). 26,27 In the context of next-generation PMMA synthesis one can put forward the polymerization of MMA and 2-methylene-1,3dioxepane (MDO). The (bio)degradation proceeds in two distinct stages, with in the first stage hydrolysis of the ester groups resulting in vinyl oligomer formation and in the second stage the biodegradation of these oligomers by bacteria. 27,28 As for the conventional thermochemical recycling it is essential to know the location of the degradable functional groups in the vinyl-like chains as they are triggering the degradation. Recent work of Gigmes et al. 26 already highlighted the need of suited reactivity ratios under batch conditions. Once a CKA unit is incorporated cross-propagation should be taking place with consequently several vinyl monomer unit incorporations to enable the pseudo-homopolymer character. Here one aims at a controlled vinyl monomer segment length distribution (SLD) in view of potential classification as a (bio)degradable polymer.One can imagine that the location and concentrations of these structural defects, in general functional groups, has an immense effect on the thermal PMMA degradation kinetics, as a certain thermal energy is only capable to break/alter certain chemical bonds/moieties.

        <p>Hence, it is essential to have detailed molecular information on a chain-by-chain basis both for thermochemical recycling of conventional PMMA (waste) and the synthesis of next-generation PMMA with (bio)degradable units. Such knowledge would allow for each chain at any reaction time -either for the polymer synthesis or thermochemical recycling -to verify what the individual locations of all (co)monomer unit types and functional groups are. To acquire that level of structural detail kinetic modeling is a powerful tool as it can access the concentration evolutions of many types of molecules and thus an evaluation of product spectra along the progress of the chemical modification considered. 8,14 Despite that the modeling of FRP has been a research field for decades 29,30 a detailed chain-by-chain kinetic modeling is rather scarce as traditionally in both the experimental and modeling community no direct link exists to a subsequent (thermo)chemical recycling. For most FRP applications (e.g. packaging materials and household goods) knowledge about basic/overall polymer properties such as the mass average molar mass, dispersity and branching density usually suffices to categorize the polymer as eligible. Only for specialty polymers, such as block/gradient copolymers and coating precursors as made for instance by more dedicated reversible deactivation radical polymerization techniques, it already became clear that optimal synthesis conditions require more advanced modeling tools. [31][32][33][34][35][36] Furthermore, the older kinetic models typically rely on more basic deterministic techniques 37,38 aiming understandably only at the prediction of the monomer conversion and average molecular properties, specifically average chain lengths. 39 However, even "simple" polymers such as PMMA [39][40][41] are distributed with respect to chain length, while the synthesis is characterized by side reactions and chain length dependent reactivities caused by a interplay of chemistry and diffusional limitations. 42,43 Hence, one needs to solve a very high amount of strongly coupled differential equations to deterministically describe the kinetics of populations of macromolecule types. 44 At one point numerical issues are unavoidably encountered and only a limited number of specialized deterministic techniques have been developed to tackle distribution effects, typically for more basic reaction schemes and intrinsic kinetics. [45][46][47][48] The mathematical treatment of several population types in radical polymerization is more elegantly tackled by kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) techniques, which have become very popular in the recent decades due to the increased computational power and the ease of implementation. 20,[49][50][51][52] The basis of kMC techniques is the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) as proposed by Gillespie et al. 53 Starting from a sufficiently high amount of initial molecules, SSA randomly samples reaction event by reaction event in a discrete manner in accordance with the reaction probabilities that are dictated by so-called MC or microscopic reaction rates as expressed in frequencies thus s -1 . In radical polymerization, many reaction events can take place and specific focus has been on the development of kMC algorithms in which chain length dependencies either on the reaction (variation in reactivities) or molecule (variation in concentrations) level are efficiently addressed. 20,48,54 Originally the focus was on the use of binary tree structures but to enable detailed molecular information on a chain-by-chain basis matrix-based kMC algorithms are recommended. 30,55,56 Every cell in matrix format allows to store specific information regarding the local composition of an individual chain, e.g. its monomer sequences. Most studies have however dealt with low average chain length polymerization processes and simplified reaction schemes with a limited amount of structural parameters or defects. 11,12,14,15,19,57,58 For instance, in these kMC models, the main objective is only on the tracking of end-chain unsaturations but no differentiation is made based on addition steps thus not allowing a mapping of head-tail, head-head, tail-head and tail-tail structural parameters along the chains, as required to fully address the circularity aspect from Figure 1. In most FRP kinetic studies one only considers head-to-tail propagation although some exceptions exist specifically for vinyl acetate as monomer. [59][60][61] To lift the applicability of matrix-based kMC techniques to the field of (i) commercial thermochemical recycling thus involving high average chain length polymers and (ii) next-generation polymer synthesis of vinyl polymers a further design of the underlying implementation principles is needed, as currently limitations regarding computer capacity and appreciation in simulation time are manifested. In the past some Monte Carlo techniques have been developed for modeling the degradation of polymeric materials. Some efforts include lattice based models which represent the polymeric material in a 2/3D matrix, where each node corresponds to a piece of the 3D polymer material. [62][63][64][65][66] A recent study by Adema et al. 66 discusses the photodegradation of polyester-urethane coatings, where the coatings are subdivided into small cubes. These cubes are an ensemble of different chemical moieties and the degradation of some of these moieties is modeled using an elementary reaction scheme. Other efforts include the modeling of the thermal degradation of polymeric materials specifically. [67][68][69][70][71][72][73][74][75] Most of them however, are not elementary reaction step driven as they generally adopt a very basic reaction scheme (e.g. only random chain fission) with mostly first order reactions and involve TGA analyses with overall degradation rates. Some studies have modeled the thermal degradation of polymers in a very detailed way making use of a complex and extensive reaction network 67,68 , however focus only on the degradation and the input for the degradation model is generally simulated based on theoretical distributions or experimentally determined SEC-traces. Also, general Monte Carlo models have been used to study the time evolution of the polymer molecular weight distribution during degradation in linear 71 , cross-linked 76 , branched [77][78][79] and star-shaped polymers 80 . These studies involve random sampling and chain fission probabilities to study the degradation of polymer chains, but the fission probabilities are not related to rate coefficients of the elementary reaction steps. In this work, a novel matrix-based elementary reaction step driven isothermal lab-scale kMC modeling algorithm is therefore presented, which keeps track of individual molecular structures of chains both during radical polymerization and subsequent thermochemical recycling or degradation, whilst using a novel compression method for the storage of long polymer chains.Hence, it is essential to have detailed molecular information on a chain-by-chain basis both for thermochemical recycling of conventional PMMA (waste) and the synthesis of next-generation PMMA with (bio)degradable units.

        <p>As visible in Figure 2 (top part) focusing for simplicity only on 3 chains at a given moment present in FRP of MMA or the subsequent thermal degradation, this detailed molecular information is stored by using a main matrix and a submatrix in contrast to our previous work on kMC modeling regarding the synthesis of linear (or slightly branched) polymers in which only one matrix type has been used. The main matrix is a sequence matrix with its labels (spheres in Figure 2: top part) highlighting the nature of the sequence of chemical moieties/structural defects present in the selected chain from "left" to "right". A label can refer for instance to an initiator fragment, a monomer sequence (thus a series of MMA units), a head-to-head defect, and a (un)saturated chain end. The submatrix (squares in Figure 2: top part) provides for the consecutive labels of monomer sequences in the main matrix the actual lengths of the monomer sequences, explaining the name segment length matrix. The concept of a main and a submatrix is further highlighted at the bottom part of Figure 2, focusing on one chain in the second test case, the radical copolymerization of MMA and MDO. The consecutive numbers in the segment length matrix automatically reflect a switch of the comonomer type from MMA to MDO or vice versa.As visible in Figure 2 (top part) focusing for simplicity only on 3 chains at a given moment present in FRP of MMA or the subsequent thermal degradation, this detailed molecular information is stored by using a main matrix and a submatrix in contrast to our previous work on kMC modeling regarding the synthesis of linear (or slightly branched) polymers in which only one matrix type has been used. The main matrix is a sequence matrix with its labels (spheres in Figure 2: top part) highlighting the nature of the sequence of chemical moieties/structural defects present in the selected chain from "left" to "right".

        <p>The basis of this elementary reaction step driven model is Gillespie's algorithm, 53 which is explained in detail in the supporting information (see Figure S1 andS2). To facilitate the identification of certain matrix positions and to store molecular information upon executing the kMC algorithm efficient data structure rules are required, as explained in more detail in the Supporting Information (cf. Figure S2). Specifically the separation in a main and submatrix allows for compression of the former while in any case keeping the correct chain length, even for the longest chains present by elegantly utilizing the last element of each row. This implies that the tail of the MMD is accurately represented, which solves a challenge in the field of polymerization kinetics with typically unavoidable extensive noise at the higher chain length region. 101 In the present work such noise remains only relevant for the very extreme chain lengths representing species with very low concentrations. At these extreme chain lengths an averaging transfer to monomer and subsequent chain initiation by the monomeric radical fragment. The last reaction leads to a chain end that resembles that of a dead chain formed through termination by disproportionation but needs to be stored separately from a kinetic point of view (other colored sphere in Figure 2: top part). The competition between termination by disproportionation and recombination is important to characterize the PMMA at the inlet of a subsequent thermochemical recycling process. In particular, the location and amount of termination defects is important to account for various degradation initiation mechanisms. In the present work, the relative importance of both termination modes is based on the work of Nakamura et al. 103 Also the corresponding Arrhenius parameters to calculate chemical thus intrinsic rate coefficients (kchem values) are provided in Table 1. These coefficients are all based on literature data. 26,55,81,61, For termination apparent rate coefficients (kt,app values) are however directly used. For such bimolecular reactions, even for low monomer conversions, diffusional limitations are already relevant, 20,81,104 since the mobility of two (macro)radicals in a viscous environment is easily restricted and strongly chain length dependent. This is the so-called gel-or Trommsdorff effect 105 so that the average apparent termination reactivities (&lt;kt(c/d),app&gt;) drop, leading to a rate acceleration and increase in average chain length at one point in the FRP. Depending on the nature of the reaction mixture and monomer type, this switch is truly manifesting between Xm equal to 20 and 70%. 2 In the last decades, extensive efforts have been made to develop fundamental methods to predict kt(c/d),app as a function of both chain length and polymer mass fraction or Xm. 21,54,97,106 One of the most promising methods is the composite kt model, which is also known as the reversible addition fragmentation -chain length dependent -termination (RAFT-CLD-T) model of which the key equations are mentioned in Section S2 of the Supporting Information. The corresponding parameters for polymerization temperatures above 323 K are directly taken from the work of Johnston-Hall and Monteiro 82,97 and are listed in Table 2. At lower temperatures preliminary screening in this work revealed that part of these parameters needed to be adapted, which is not surprising as such temperatures are further away from the glass transition temperature of the polymer so that less mobility is expected. The reported changes are within expected variations with specifically an activation energy for termination between macroradicals of unity chain length equal to 5.6 mol -1 . 93,94 Also for the other reactions in Table 1 we need to account for diffusional limitations. Apart from the gel-effect, there are two other main phenomena that relate to diffusional limitations in FRP: the glass and cage effect. The former relates to a decrease in the apparent (to a first approximation chain length independent) propagation rate coefficient kp,app at high Xm at temperatures typically below the glass transition temperature of the reaction mixture. 104,107 The latter describes the decrease in the apparent initiator efficiency fapp with increasing Xm. In the present work free volume based theories are considered based on the work of Buback et al. 84 The relevant equations and literature-based parameters 48,81 are given in Section S2 of the Supporting Information. To describe the glass effect over a broad temperature range (323-363 K) the current work revealed an optimized monomer diffusion activation energy of 23.5 kJ mol -1 to accurately grasp the kinetics of the lower temperature range (323 K) compared to value of 12 kJ mol -1 for the higher temperature range (&gt; 323 K).The basis of this elementary reaction step driven model is Gillespie's algorithm, 53 which is explained in detail in the supporting information (see Figure S1 andS2).

        <p>For the kinetic description of the degradation of the MMA/MDO copolymer only the hydrolysis reaction is required. As shown in Figure 4(b) each MDO moiety can be hydrolyzed.

        <p>Bulk FRP has been studied intensively in the past decades. 21,81,84,[93][94][95]104,110 With MMA as monomer historically the main target has been on the simulation of average molecular properties as experimentally often recorded under isothermal conditions, as for instance done in the leading study by Hamielec and Balke. 81,104,107,110 A first challenge remains the correct representation of diffusional limitations on termination. Most termination models are based on overall fitting parameters and have no direct link with the actual measurement of the chain length and monomer conversion dependencies of apparent termination rate coefficients. In this respect the more recent developments based on the RAFT-CLD-T technique 82,[97][98][99] are very relevant although they have been rarely combined with the actual description of FRP kinetics. 98,111,112 The relevance of such combination was recently put forward by De Keer et al. 111 for FRP of styrene, highlighting that only with such detailed RAFT-CLD-T parameters the bimodal character of the log-MMD and the impact of reaction conditions on the interplay of chain transfer to monomer/dimer and termination could be fully captured.Bulk FRP has been studied intensively in the past decades. 21,81,84,[93][94][95]104,110 With MMA as monomer historically the main target has been on the simulation of average molecular properties as experimentally often recorded under isothermal conditions, as for instance done in the leading study by Hamielec and Balke. 81,104,107,110 A first challenge remains the correct representation of diffusional limitations on termination.

        <p>In the present work it is further confirmed that chain length and monomer conversion dependent RAFT-CLD-T parameters allow to accurately reflect the gel-effect, as for instance illustrated in Figure 6 focusing at a comparison of simulation and experimental results at 343 K. The green full lines highlight an acceptable joint description of the experimental variation of the monomer conversion with time and the xn evolution with monomer conversion (green symbols), considering the literature based parameters in Table 1 and2. Preference should here be first given to the correct description of the experimental monomer conversion data and then the experimental xn data, as the former are characterized by a much lower experimental error. This good match without additional tuning (condition from high temperature regime) is remarkable and highlights the overall strength of the use of the RAFT-CLD-T technique to describe the gel-effect. incorporation of cage, glass, and gel-effect (parameters in Table 1 and2). Green diamonds: experimental data points 110 The simulated full green lines are not only affected by the gel-effect as not only diffusional limitations on termination matter but also those on propagation and conventional initiation, specifically from intermediate monomer conversions onwards, as illustrated by the other simulated lines in this figure and further confirmed in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information depicting the variations of the corresponding apparent (rate) coefficients. For completeness the dotted red line gives the simulations results at 343 K with only intrinsic kinetics thus no correction for diffusional limitations at all. This implies that for termination always the g iven kt11,app value in Table 2 is utilized in the kMC model. From this simulation it becomes clear why previous studies have focused so heavily on the description of diffusional limitations, as the complete wrong simulated trend results. There is under such model assumptions no S-shaped curve for the monomer conversion and xn is always decreasing in contrast to what is observed experimentally in Figure 5(b). Furthermore, with only a gel-effect so with always a constant kp,chem as in Table 1 and considering a typical average low monomer conversion value of 0.58 81 for fchem, the dashed black lines in Figure 5 result, which demonstrates a very strong impact of the gel-effect on both FRP characteristics. Less termination because of lower average apparent termination rate coefficients implies more propagation and thus an increase in both the simulated polymerization rate and xn variation.In the present work it is further confirmed that chain length and monomer conversion dependent RAFT-CLD-T parameters allow to accurately reflect the gel-effect, as for instance illustrated in Figure 6 focusing at a comparison of simulation and experimental results at 343 K.

        <p>The additional consideration of the glass effect in Figure 5 (yellow dashed-dotted line) allows to explain the experimental limit on the highest achievable monomer conversion (value of ca. 0.9), as the propagation rate is strongly diminished toward the end of the polymerization because of a sudden drop of the apparent propagation rate coefficient. This combined consideration of the gel-and glass effect (yellow dashed-dotted line) although leads to a more pronounced increase of the simulated Xm at lower times in Figure 5(a) in contrast to what is experimentally observed. This mismatch for Xm is overcome by also considering the cage effect (from yellow dashed-dotted to green full line), i.e. the decrease of fapp from intermediate Xm onwards. In practice, the reaction mixture becomes gradually more viscous for AIBN initiator fragments to escape their so-called solvent cage and instead they react more and more with each other to form inert side products. In the present work, the fapp variation is evaluated based on the model equations put forward in the pioneering work of Buback et al. 84 At low Xm however this fapp model gives a value of 0.50 (see Table 1), which is slightly lower than 0.58 which is the value used during the whole FRP for the previously discussed black dashed and yellow dashed-dotted simulated lines. With the implementation of fapp the radical concentration thus decreases, explaining why Xm increases more slowly and xn more strongly with an inclusion of the cage-effect (green full lines). At the highest monomer conversions, the glass-effect becomes very dominant and a cessation of the FRP takes place, despite that AIBN fragments can still be formed. The good benchmark between the kMC model and experiment is further confirmed in Figure 6 considering several temperatures (323, 343 and 363 K) and two initial AIBN concentrations (0.016 and 0.027 mol L -1 ). prediction of the monomer conversion and xn is good, whereas the prediction of xm is somewhat less as is also the case in the modeling work of Achilias and Kiparissides 81 considering the determinisic method of moments. This can be traced back to an original comment by Hamielec and Balke 110 mentioning that the reproducibility of the central chromatogram heights was very good whereas the tails showed poor reproducibility. Hence, on an overall basis -thus considering the results in Figure 5 and 6 and the previous comment -it can be concluded that the kMC model is representative to describe FRP of MMA.The additional consideration of the glass effect in Figure 5 (yellow dashed-dotted line) allows to explain the experimental limit on the highest achievable monomer conversion (value of ca. 0.9), as the propagation rate is strongly diminished toward the end of the polymerization because of a sudden drop of the apparent propagation rate coefficient.

        <p>A closer inspection of Figure 6 reveals that by lowering the polymerization temperature and/or decreasing the initial AIBN amount much higher average chain lengths are obtained at the expense of polymerization time and limiting monomer conversion. Unde r such conditions diffusional limitations are also stronger as shown in Figure S5 of the Supporting Information. A stronger dro p of the averaged apparent rate coefficients for termination and propagation is observed, explaining in Figure 6 the stronger increase at lower monomer conversions for xn and xm (stronger gel-effect) and the lower limiting conversion (stronger glass effect). A lower temperature also implies lower initial fapp values and stronger decreases, further supporting these trends of a lower polymerization rate and the formation of longer chains at the larger monomer conversions. This again highlights the need of kinetic models f ully accounting for the interplay of chemistry and diffusional limitations.A closer inspection of Figure 6 reveals that by lowering the polymerization temperature and/or decreasing the initial AIBN amount much higher average chain lengths are obtained at the expense of polymerization time and limiting monomer conversion.

        <p>The strength of a kMC model is that it allows to obtain all molecular information at any time in the synthesis at any reaction condition thus also the full details regarding chain length characteristics at the limiting conversions at the lower polymeri zation temperatures and initial AIBN amounts. As shown in Figure 6(b) and Figure 6(c) at such limiting monomer conversions (black dashed dotted and blue dashed lines) no experimental xn and xm values could be recorded but the kMC model could still be run. Moreover, this kinetic model gives access the the complete (log-)MMD and also information on the concentration and location of functional groups and structural defects. It should be stressed that older kinetic models revolving around the method of moments are typically only devoted to the calculation of averages and thus not such detailed molecular distributions.The strength of a kMC model is that it allows to obtain all molecular information at any time in the synthesis at any reaction condition thus also the full details regarding chain length characteristics at the limiting conversions at the lower polymeri zation temperatures and initial AIBN amounts.

        <p>For example, as shown in Figure 7(a), focusing on the bulk isothermal FRP of MMA at a low polymerization temperature of 323 K with [AIBN]0= 0.027 mol L -1 , the kMC model is capable to depict at selected monomer conversions the log-MMD. Emphasis is here on a Xm of 0.1 (blue line), 0.5 (black line) and 0.85 (red line), the latter being the simulated limiting conversion. It follows that there is a strong shift towards higher molar mass with monomer conversion, as is also confirmed by the strong increase of the xn value in Figure 6(b). This tendency of long chain formation even results in a higher molar mass peak at high monomer conversion in Figure 7(a), which again stresses the importance of the gel-effect and diffusional limitations in general. Due to the strong drop in the apparent termination rate, the macroradicals are at one point able to grow significantly longer and this results in a separate polymer population with higher molar mass. . Also here the effect of diffusional limitations comes into play. On the one hand termination by disproportionation is suppressed, leading to less functionality formation, but on the other hand chain transfer to monomer is more likely as chains are longer active. At the higher monomer conversions the monomer becomes although depleted, explaining the less pronounced increases at larger reaction times for both lines in Figure 7(b), with in any case larger values at the higher temperature (green line) as then the relative importance of chain transfer to monomer and termination by disproportionation is higher.For example, as shown in Figure 7(a), focusing on the bulk isothermal FRP of MMA at a low polymerization temperature of 323 K with [AIBN]0= 0.027 mol L -1 , the kMC model is capable to depict at selected monomer conversions the log-MMD.

        <p>Figure 7(c) (purple full line) in turn shows the log-MMD at limiting conversion for a general reaction condition not included in Figure 6: 353 K with [AIBN]0= 0.17 mol L -1 . It follows that again a distribution of bimodal nature is obtained with an elongated tail, although less pronounced due to a weaker gel effect at higher temperatures. Compared to Figure 7(a) this log-MMD is relatively shifted more to the lower molar mass region as well. Hence, depending on the reaction conditions the shape and positioning of the log-MMD is completely different, highlighting the need of a detailed kinetic modeling approach, as demonstrated in the present work.

        <p>As already highlighed in the discussion of the PMMA synthesis, the left subplot at the bottom of Figure 8 (0% mass loss) is characterized by head-to-head defects (red dots). These defects are the most prone to initiate a degradation mechanism consistent with the highest initiation rate coefficient in Table 3 (first row), which is so high that it compensates for these defects being present in undersize compared to monomer units with many head-to-tail bonds thus many locations for head-to-tail fission. It follows from the middle subplot at the bottom of Figure 8 (35 m% loss) that indeed such defects quickly disappear, as they are not present anymore. Moreover, in the right subplot at the bottom of Figure 8 (mass loss of 70%) they cannot be identified. Since these headto-head defects are exclusively formed through termination by recombination of two macroradicals in the prior synthesis, these chains occupy the larger molar mass region so that it can be understood why the high molar mass peak in the log-MMD (Figure 8; top) strongly decreases so that the distribution is more located at lower molar masses in the first 35% of mass loss.As already highlighed in the discussion of the PMMA synthesis, the left subplot at the bottom of Figure 8 (0% mass loss) is characterized by head-to-head defects (red dots).

        <p>At higher mass losses (35-70% mass loss) there is thus a larger dominance of the other two initiation mechanisms in Figure 3 although the parameters in Table 3 indicate that there is preference for fission at an unsaturated chain end. The presence of such unsaturations is confirmed in the middle and right subplot by for instance the yellow squares representing terminal vinyl bonds as originating from termination by disproportionation during the preceding FRP or as formed during the thermal degradation. However, the number of monomer units is high with respect to the number of unsaturations so that both degradation phenomena are taking place from a kinetic point of view. Upon degradation species can ultimately become MMA, explaining the increase of the signal at log(M)=2 in the top of Figure 9. In addition, also more colors can be identified in the bottom plots of Figure 8 for the first positions. At the start one has dominantly blue (AIBN fragment) and occasionally green (chain transfer to monomer fragment) but later on one also has for instance purple. Due to chain fission the "right" saturated ends due to termination by disproportionation or chain transfer to monomer become "left" chain ends as the radical centre is always plotted at the "right" end of the chain. To give the reader some idea of how the quantity of structural defects and functional groups evolves during both polymerization and degradation we refer to Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. The Figure S6 is similar to Figure 7(b) (where the evolution of the unsaturated chain concentration is shown during FRP of MMA), however here the evolution of all relevant functional groups/defects are shown both during polymerization and subsequent degradation.At higher mass losses (35-70% mass loss) there is thus a larger dominance of the other two initiation mechanisms in Figure 3 although the parameters in Table 3 indicate that there is preference for fission at an unsaturated chain end.

        <p>The thermal degradation at 625 K is also modeled for a significantly different starting PMMA as made through FRP at higher temperature and initial AIBN concentration (363K and [AIBN]0 = 0.17 mol L -1 ). Such conditions result in a polymer with a much lower average chain length and thus a log-MMD that is more shifted towards the left (see red line in top of Figure 9), due to the higher radical concentration and the higher (apparent) termination rate during the synthesis. Also the dispersity of this initial distribution in Figure 9 (top) is much lower (Ɖ = 2.39) compared to the dispersity of the polymer in Figure 8 (Ɖ = 6.29). With elevated temperature and initial AIBN concentration the gel-effect is less present and the bimodal character for the log-MMD is rather minimal. This limited impact of larger chains also follows from the left bottom subplot in Figure 9 with more grey background, implying that very short chains are present already at the start with e.g. chain ends formed by termination by disproportionation (yellow dots).The thermal degradation at 625 K is also modeled for a significantly different starting PMMA as made through FRP at higher temperature and initial AIBN concentration (363K and [AIBN]0 = 0.17 mol L -1 ).

        <p>As the number of monomer units is on average lower per chain and head-to-head defects are present in many chains again the degradation mechanism starts with a dominant role for initiaton by head-to-head fission. Here the tail of the log-MMD is also degradated strongly at the start as on a relative basis still many long chains are existing with such head-to-head defects. The corresponding log-MMD at 35% mass loss is depicted as green dots in Figure 9 (top) and upon comparison with the log-MMD at 70% mass loss (blue dots in the same subfigure) a quite regulated degradation pattern can be identified, which is an indication that the chain length of unzipping can be similar to the average chain length of the polymer chains. If this is not the case termination occurs so that smaller dead PMMA chains are formed, shifting the log-MMD to the left. On a log-scale this effect seems small but on normal scale it still relates to a lowering with 1000 monomer units. This thus highlights the relevance of parameter tuning of elementary rate coefficients for thermal degradation in future studies.As the number of monomer units is on average lower per chain and head-to-head defects are present in many chains again the degradation mechanism starts with a dominant role for initiaton by head-to-head fission.

It follows that the polymerization is finalized after ca. 4.5 hours with a final xn and Ɖ value of ca. 107 and 4.2.

        <p>Figure 10(a) (middle lines) depicts the corresponding variation in instantaneous (average or overall) copolymer composition (FMMA,inst: left axis; FMDO,inst: right axis), thus how much of each comonomer is incorporated instantaneously over all chains together.

        <p>This formula gives for 𝐹 𝑀𝑀𝐴,𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡 values of 0.919, 0.812 and 0.659 (black spheres in Figure 10(a)) for the three situations according to decreasing initial MMA amount. The kMC simulations give values of 0.918, 0.811 and 0.656 at 1% overall monomer conversion, highlighting the consistency of the developed framework. These data also allow to deduce that fMDO,0 has to be sufficiently large to garantuee the satisfactory incorporation of MDO in the chains. For example, with fMDO,0=0.75 the (co)polymer chains formed at the start only consist for ca. 35% out of MDO units. It further follows that in each of the 3 situations one observes so-called composition drifting [114][115][116][117] with the monomer mixture being depleted in MMA so that chains formed later on are more rich in MDO units. For example, for fMMA,0=fMDO,0=0.5, the chains contain as much as 80% MMA units at low overall monomer conversions, while polymer chains formed at high overall monomer conversion (&gt; 0.80) contain no MMA units at all. For the situation with less MMA at the start (fMMA,0=0.25; fMDO,0=0.75) this switch to a dominance of MDO incorporation understandably takes place at a lower overall monomer conversion of 0.60 and for the situation with more MMA at the start (fMMA,0=0.75; fMDO,0=0.25) this switch is still unavoidable, with the switch occurring at an overall monomer conversion of ca. 0.80. Hence, for any situation, the instantaneous comonomer incorporation rates are strongly time depending so that a very strong intermolecular compositional heterogeneity results. 118 This inherent heterogeneity for (batch) radical copolymerization affects the efficiency of subsequent degradation/recycling processes. Specifically for the MMA/MDO system under investigation this leads to an important design criterion in view of ease of degradability. The MMA segments that are formed the earliest will be the longest, possibly too long to be biodegraded by biota later on. This is aptly illustrated in Figure 10(b), which shows the explicit visualization of individual monomer sequences of a representative number of copolymer chains as present at final overall monomer conversion (fMMA,0=fMDO,0=0.5), with green being a MDO unit and blue a MMA unit. Note that the chain labels on the y-axis are sampled chronologically during the kMC simulation of the radical copolymerization, hence, the higher they are located in the subplot the more likely they present chain formation at a higher overall monomer conversion. This boils down to the fact that the chains at the bottom represent chains formed at low overal monomer conversion whilst chains at the top are formed close to an overall monomer conversion of 1.This formula gives for 𝐹 𝑀𝑀𝐴,𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡 values of 0.919, 0.812 and 0.659 (black spheres in Figure 10(a)) for the three situations according to decreasing initial MMA amount.

This is aptly illustrated in Figure 10(b), which shows the explicit visualization of individual monomer sequences of a representative number of copolymer chains as present at final overall monomer conversion (fMMA,0=fMDO,0=0.5), with green being a MDO unit and blue a MMA unit. Note that the chain labels on the y-axis are sampled chronologically during the kMC simulation of the radical copolymerization, hence, the higher they are located in the subplot the more likely they present chain formation at a higher overall monomer conversion. This boils down to the fact that the chains at the bottom represent chains formed at low overal monomer conversion whilst chains at the top are formed close to an overall monomer conversion of 1.</p>
        <p>It is clear from Figure 10(b) that the compositional heterogeneity of the copolymer product is high if the whole overall monomer conversion range is considered. Consistent with the trends in Figure 10(a) it is observed that the longest MMA segments are indeed formed at the beginning, as witnessed by the long blue segments at the lower part of the visualization plot. These are exactly the oversized segments which form the bottleneck for a successful degradation, as will covered later on. At high overall monomer conversions the chains are much shorter due to monomer depletion and they are becoming in the limit more "green" MDO homopolymer chains thus off-spec with respect to the target of the synthesis of PMMA-like chains. This explains why it has been recommended to not conduct the polymerization up to the end but to stop earlier to recover the unreacted MDO monomer. 26 Post-processing of explicit vizualizations allows to simulate SLDs (see examples in Figure S8 of the Supporting Information) and average segment lengths as well. To ensure that the predicted segment lengths are reliable, we have benchmarked the model predictions at 1% overall monomer conversion (values of 11.3/1.01, 4.44/1.04 and 2.14/1.10; MMA/MDO; again for the three situations according to decreasing initial MMA amount) against the ones accessible by applying the Mayo and Lewis terminal model (values of 11.5/1.01, 4.50/1.04 and 2.17/1.12; Equation S12 of the Supporting Information). Constitent data are again obtained as also further deducible by focusing at the Hence, the kMC model is capable to correctly predict the copolymer composition and segment lengths for the copolymerization of MMA and MDO, which are the most important molecular characteristics to predict the degradation by hydrolysis covered in the next subsection.It is clear from Figure 10(b) that the compositional heterogeneity of the copolymer product is high if the whole overall monomer conversion range is considered. Consistent with the trends in Figure 10(a) it is observed that the longest MMA segments are indeed formed at the beginning, as witnessed by the long blue segments at the lower part of the visualization plot.

        <p>One way to improve the biodegradability of vinyl polymers is the insertion of chemically less stable ester linkages in the polymer backbone during the synthesis, ideally each 10 th or 20 th monomer unit. 27,28 Upon hydrolyis (Figure 5(b)) such (co)polymers chains are converted into functional oligomers which can either be upcycled to new polymer products or biodegraded by bacteria. However, as vizualized in Figure 10(b) (fMMA,0=fMDO,0=0.5), these ester linkages are not included exactly every 10 th or 20 th unit in the backbone. Instead, severe compositional drifting occurs on top of the inherent random character of the propagation steps of Figure 4(a), as explained above.One way to improve the biodegradability of vinyl polymers is the insertion of chemically less stable ester linkages in the polymer backbone during the synthesis, ideally each 10 th or 20 th monomer unit. 27,28 Upon hydrolyis (Figure 5(b)) such (co)polymers chains are converted into functional oligomers which can either be upcycled to new polymer products or biodegraded by bacteria.

        <p>The explicit visualization of the hydrolysis process considering as starting point the copolymer as made upon using fMMA,0=fMDO,0=0.5 and a final overall monomer conversion of 1 is shown in Figure S9. Hence, the left subplot (red box) in Figure S9 is the same as the vizualization plot shown in Figure 10(b). The right plot in Figure S9 shows the completely degraded product with the blue segments representing the remaining MMA-based oligomers. The figure in the middle gives the vizualization at which 50% of the ester linkages have been hydrolysed, as indicated by the white spaces on the grey original background. The subplots at the bottom are a zoom-in of the chains with a chain label between 200 and 300 to showcase the evolution of these chains more clearly during the hydrolysis and to have a better view of the length of both the MMA and MDO segments.The explicit visualization of the hydrolysis process considering as starting point the copolymer as made upon using fMMA,0=fMDO,0=0.5 and a final overall monomer conversion of 1 is shown in Figure S9.

        <p>Figure 11 shows the corresponding log-MMDs before (red line) and after complete (blue line) hydrolysis, including a first vertical black demarcation line around log(M) = 3.3, corresponding to a chain with 20 MMA units and a second such line at log(M) = 3, corresponding to a chain with 10 MMA units. Both lines together define the grey zone in Figure 11. Using the log(M) values of 3 and 3.3 as an upper limit for biodegradability, it is clear that the majority of the MMA segments can be degraded by bacteria. The segments which are longer than 20 MMA units are mainly formed at lower overall monomer conversion during the synthesis. As the copolymerization has been carried out in batch the MMA unit incorporation is then very high and only decreasing at higher overall monomer conversions. In other words, the on target PMMA-like chains are only formed later on in the batch process. Reversly the very short chains are directly biodegradable as they are MDO-rich. As explained above, they are formed at the end of the radical copolymerization synthesis but they are not PMMA-like and therefore also off-spec.Figure 11 shows the corresponding log-MMDs before (red line) and after complete (blue line) hydrolysis, including a first vertical black demarcation line around log(M) = 3.3, corresponding to a chain with 20 MMA units and a second such line at log(M) = 3, corresponding to a chain with 10 MMA units.

        <p>To obtain a PMMA-like product with an even beter degradability one should consider (i) either increasing the feed fraction of MDO, (ii) choose a comonomer combination with more suitable monomer reactivity ratios, preferably close to 1, or (iii) synthesize the copolymer according to a semi-batch procedure. 117 However, for the current purpose of highlighting the proof-of-concept of connecting synthesis and recycling of FRP-made copolymers a suboptimal set of reaction conditions featuring severe drifting is better suited to illustrate the general capability of the kMC tool. It should be further stressed that Figure 11 is also characterized by an excellent mathematical description of the tail of the distribution, as witnessed by the limited noise at the higher molar masses, highlighting the relevance of the compression-based matrix modeling framework in case high average chan length polymers are targeted.To obtain a PMMA-like product with an even beter degradability one should consider (i) either increasing the feed fraction of MDO, (ii) choose a comonomer combination with more suitable monomer reactivity ratios, preferably close to 1, or (iii) synthesize the copolymer according to a semi-batch procedure. 117 However, for the current purpose of highlighting the proof-of-concept of connecting synthesis and recycling of FRP-made copolymers a suboptimal set of reaction conditions featuring severe drifting is better suited to illustrate the general capability of the kMC tool.

        <p>Matrix-based kMC modeling is a powerful tool to study both radical polymerization and degradation as it allows to store kinetic and molecular information on a chain-by-chain-basis so that specific reactions can be explicitly executed. Moreover, the introduced compression method enables to fully describe the shape of the log-MMD with a possible location of its tail in the high molar mass region, which is often characterized by elevated noise-to-signal ratios both based on experimental and more conventional computational analysis.Matrix-based kMC modeling is a powerful tool to study both radical polymerization and degradation as it allows to store kinetic and molecular information on a chain-by-chain-basis so that specific reactions can be explicitly executed.

        <p>To illustrate the strength of matrix-baed kMC modeling a differentiation has been made between homopolymers and copolymers considering MMA as the main monomer. For the former, a detailed isothermal lab-scale kinetic study of FRP of MMA and the subsequent thermal degradation with high monomer recovery has been performed. For the latter, focus has been on the understanding of the lab-scale isothermal kinetics of the radical copolymerization of MMA and MDO in view of controlling segment lengths to enable the transformation in biodegradable oligmers after hydrolysis in a later stage.To illustrate the strength of matrix-baed kMC modeling a differentiation has been made between homopolymers and copolymers considering MMA as the main monomer.

        <p>The log-MMD is a crucial molecular property to fully understand thermochemical recycling. During conventional synthesis this distribution can develop bimodality at higher monomer conversions, lower polymerization temperatures and lower initial conventional radical concentrations. This bimodality is caused by the prominent rol of the gel-effect and to fully grasp the detailed shape of the log-MMD one should additionally account for the glass and cage effect. During the thermal degradation the chains from the tail with weak head-to-head defects are first attacked. At higher polymer mass losses one also observes the contributions starting with fission at an unsaturated chain-end and head-to-tail fission, the latter supported by the presence of a high number of monomer units.The log-MMD is a crucial molecular property to fully understand thermochemical recycling.

        <p>For the copolymerization of MMA and MDO under batch conditions the compositional drifting is strong so that inherently very relevant chain-to-chain deviations exist. This strong intermolecular copolymer hetereogeneity has a direct impact on the degradation behavior and it is an important insight for the chemical treatment of copolymers in general. This has been illustrated by showcasing that upon hydrolyis the copolymer chains that have been formed first during the copolymer synthesis possess too long MMA segments and those formed toward the end are characterized by too long MDO segments. In other words, only a specific fraction of copolymer chains has a regulated incorporation of the ester functional moieties. An inspection of the shift of the log-MMD upon complete hydrolysis although reveals that the majority of the MMA segments has a length below a threshold value of 20 and even 10 in many situations.For the copolymerization of MMA and MDO under batch conditions the compositional drifting is strong so that inherently very relevant chain-to-chain deviations exist.

        <p>Hence, it is clear that to study (thermal) degradation of (co)polymers it is beneficial to know in detail the composition of the starting polymer reactant. The developed kMC strategy can be seen as an important tool to support the understanding of both polymerization, depolymerization and degradation kinetics and is applicable in the long run to design and connect both polymer synthesis and degradation at the level of the individual molecule. Future work will be aimed at widening the portfolio of polymer compositions addressed and the consideration of different operation modes, taking into account possible constraints due to scaleup and impurities.Hence, it is clear that to study (thermal) degradation of (co)polymers it is beneficial to know in detail the composition of the starting polymer reactant.
