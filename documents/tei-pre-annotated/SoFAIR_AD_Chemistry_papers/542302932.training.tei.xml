        <p>Background Demonstrating that the data produced in metabolic phenotyping investigations (metabolomics/metabonomics) is of good quality is increasingly seen as a key factor in gaining acceptance for the results of such studies. The use of established quality control (QC) protocols, including appropriate QC samples, is an important and evolving aspect of this process. However, inadequate or incorrect reporting of the QA/QC procedures followed in the study may lead to misinterpretation or overemphasis of the findings and prevent future metanalysis of the body of work. Objective The aim of this guidance is to provide researchers with a framework that encourages them to describe quality assessment and quality control procedures and outcomes in mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based methods in untargeted metabolomics, with a focus on reporting on QC samples in sufficient detail for them to be understood, trusted and replicated. There is no intent to be proscriptive with regard to analytical best practices; rather, guidance for reporting QA/QC procedures is suggested. A template that can be completed as studies progress to ensure that relevant data is collected, and further documents, are provided as on-line resources. Key reporting practices Multiple topics should be considered when reporting QA/QC protocols and outcomes for metabolic phenotyping data. Coverage should include the role(s), sources, types, preparation and uses of the QC materials and samples generally employed in the generation of metabolomic data. Details such as sample matrices and sample preparation, the use of test mixtures and system suitability tests, blanks and technique-specific factors are considered and methods for reporting are discussed, including the importance of reporting the acceptance criteria for the QCs. To this end, the reporting of the QC samples and results are considered at two levels of detail: "minimal" and "best reporting practice" levels.Background Demonstrating that the data produced in metabolic phenotyping investigations (metabolomics/metabonomics) is of good quality is increasingly seen as a key factor in gaining acceptance for the results of such studies.

        <p>Progress in science is based on the principle that measurements are repeatable; that is to say, it should be possible for scientists in other laboratories, equipped with the same, or similar expertise, resources and infrastructure, to replicate the results of published work within acceptable levels of confidence. Properly documented studies allow other scientists to critically assess and judge the original experimental design and should also enable researchers in other laboratories to repeat the experiment under the same conditions and support or refute the findings. However, a reproducibility crisis in science has been recently highlighted by Munafò et al. (2017) and the lack of transparency in reporting can lead to ambiguity within experimental design, data collection, as well as data processing and interpretation, a situation which is also true for metabolomics. Moreover, any metabolomic data derived from instrumental analyses must be sufficiently reliable that decisions based on it can be reported with confidence; there should be no "leap of faith" from data to knowledge. If the metabolomic data cannot be trusted, then the answer to the posed question is of little value.Progress in science is based on the principle that measurements are repeatable; that is to say, it should be possible for scientists in other laboratories, equipped with the same, or similar expertise, resources and infrastructure, to replicate the results of published work within acceptable levels of confidence.

        <p>Quality management (QM) as a concept is very old and dates from at least the Middle Ages; the Assize of Bread in 1202 was the first English food law and outlawed the adulteration of bread with lower quality ingredients (Arayne et al., 2008). In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, QM became increasingly measured, systemized and subject to statistical rigor with the introduction of several food and drug laws (Arayne et al., 2008;Sarvari et al., 2020). QM can be divided into quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC). According to ISO9000 (2015) QA addresses the activities the laboratory undertakes to provide confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled, whereas QC describes the individual measures which are used to confirm and report that the requirements have been achieved. These definitions have been jointly endorsed by CITAC (the Cooperation on International Traceability in Analytical Chemistry) and EuraChem (A Focus for Analytical Chemistry in Europe) (Barwick, 2020). In general terms, QA processes are applied before and during data acquisition and QC processes are applied during and after data acquisition. These accepted terms for QA and QC are being used by the metabolomics QA and QC Consortium (mQACC) (Evans et al., 2020). More specifically, QA focuses on processes and practices that provide confidence that the end result will be of high quality. These processes are independent of, but can include, the data acquisition process. Examples of QA include standardized training, instrument system suitability tests (SSTs) and calibration, using documented high-quality and validated standard operating procedures (SOPs) throughout the study and performing regular lab audits. QC measurements are the measurements or observations undertaken to objectively demonstrate that the quality management process has been fulfilled. In practice, most QC measurements occur during or after data acquisition. Examples of QC measurements include, but are not limited to, analysis of QC samples such as reference standards, replicate extracted samples, pooled samples and blanks. Platform specific QC samples that demonstrate system suitability (sensitivity, freedom from artefacts, resolution, etc.) are also important in demonstrating the quality of the data generated. QC reporting is also more complete when reports include study-specific metrics reported in a clear, concise format. There are a number of similar terms in use for QA/QC in metabolomics that may cause confusion. A Glossary, where we have attempted to provide some clarity, is provided in this manuscript for reference.Quality management (QM) as a concept is very old and dates from at least the Middle Ages; the Assize of Bread in 1202 was the first English food law and outlawed the adulteration of bread with lower quality ingredients (Arayne et al., 2008).

        <p>The clear reporting of the analytical procedures applied, and transparency on the practices used in the laboratory, can provide other scientists with confidence in reproducing the resulting data or incorporating existing data into other studies, either directly (shared data) or indirectly (metaanalysis). Metabolic phenotyping studies typically begin with experimental design, and progress through sample collection, sample preparation, sample analysis and data collection. The process culminates in data processing and mining, which includes many different workflows depending on the question being addressed (Beger et al., 2019;Sumner et al., 2007). These considerations are of critical importance for the acquisition of high-quality, biologically meaningful data and full reporting can help to ensure confidence in the study (Goodacre et al., 2007). Appropriate reporting of the methodology used for sample analysis, including the preanalysis procedures put in place to ensure quality and the operational procedures used to monitor the analytical process itself, enables data quality to be demonstrated and is intrinsically linked by QA/QC.The clear reporting of the analytical procedures applied, and transparency on the practices used in the laboratory, can provide other scientists with confidence in reproducing the resulting data or incorporating existing data into other studies, either directly (shared data) or indirectly (metaanalysis).

        <p>While many analytical QA/QC guidelines exist for targeted mass spectrometry assays (US Food and Drug Administration, 2018; European Medicines Agency, 2011), formal analytical guidelines for untargeted analysis are still to be developed [see e.g., (Begou et al., 2018;Naz et al., 2014)] and will then have still to gain widespread community acceptance. It would be of clear benefit to the field of metabolomics for QA/QC in untargeted metabolomics to be developed, supported, implemented and properly reported by the community. Such QA/QC reporting guidelines could be guided, perhaps, by the relevant existing standards from the FDA and EMA guidelines for targeted method validation (US Food and Drug Administration, 2018; European Medicines Agency, 2011). However, until such time as these analytical approaches have been agreed upon and accepted, there is no doubt that increased rigor in the reporting of how the QC sample results in reports and manuscripts were obtained is highly desirable. For example, the criteria used by authors to define acceptable performance in an untargeted analysis, together with the data used to demonstrate that this was indeed acceptable, should be provided in any publication or when data are deposited to public metabolomics data repositories. While we do not make specific recommendations for any particular approach or set of criteria for accepting analytical data, it is clear that such details should always be provided and be supported by readily accessible QC data.While many analytical QA/QC guidelines exist for targeted mass spectrometry assays (US Food and Drug Administration, 2018; European Medicines Agency, 2011), formal analytical guidelines for untargeted analysis are still to be developed [see e.g., (Begou et al., 2018;Naz et al., 2014)] and will then have still to gain widespread community acceptance.

        <p>Clearly a central argument for defining the quality of the information provided in any publication (or its supplementary information) and in data repositories is the ability to demonstrate that the QA/QC measures used before and during the analysis of study-derived (experimental) samples were both appropriate, suitable in terms of their design and study objectives and that the criteria used for acceptance were reasonable, achieved and reported. If the level of detail provided is insufficient for this to be assessed, it will seriously reduce confidence in results and therefore the value of the work. In fact, such factors represent a strong argument for journal editors and reviewers to suggest that the manuscript should not be accepted for publication in its present form. This may lead to requests for revision and resubmission or rejection. A secondary consequence of a focus on standardized reporting of QA/QC practices and results is the need to inform and educate those newly entering the field of metabolomics on the many factors that can affect data quality and influence results. A focus on QA/QC and dissemination of clear (minimum and best reporting practice) QA/QC practices should have the effect of naturally improving the quality of all metabolomics work.Clearly a central argument for defining the quality of the information provided in any publication (or its supplementary information) and in data repositories is the ability to demonstrate that the QA/QC measures used before and during the analysis of study-derived (experimental) samples were both appropriate, suitable in terms of their design and study objectives and that the criteria used for acceptance were reasonable, achieved and reported.

        <p>Metabolomics researchers have undertaken efforts on standardizing reporting structures from early on in mammalian and plant studies (Jenkins et al., 2004;Lindon et al., 2005) which established SMRS (Standard Metabolic Reporting Structures) and ArMet (an architecture for metabolomics), respectively. These two groups subsequently combined forces with other international scientists and this led to recommendations for reporting standards in metabolomics, with the aim of identifying, developing and disseminating a consensus description for the best chemical analysis practices related to all aspects of metabolomics. This was nicely highlighted by the Chemical Analysis Working Group (CAWG) of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) (Sumner et al., 2007) which was well received by the community at the time but has failed in its aims to be widely implemented (Spicer et al., 2017). More recently reporting standards for acquiring and analyzing untargeted and targeted metabolomics were suggested among best practice guidelines and relevant applications in regulatory toxicology by the MEtabolomics standaRds Initiative in Toxicology (MERIT) project (Viant et al., 2019). However, it is clear from even a cursory examination of the literature that these recommendations are often ignored. In addition, these references do not explicitly make suggestions for reporting of QC samples or QC results based on those samples. This manuscript proposes a framework for consistent reporting of QC sample information and quality metrics.Metabolomics researchers have undertaken efforts on standardizing reporting structures from early on in mammalian and plant studies (Jenkins et al., 2004;Lindon et al., 2005) which established SMRS (Standard Metabolic Reporting Structures) and ArMet (an architecture for metabolomics), respectively.

        <p>The need to report the quality of data measurements is more vital than ever as metabolomics-based research is increasingly used as a justification for large clinical or environmental interventions (Bearden, 2012;Gowda &amp; Raftery, 2019). In that context, it is important to distinguish between reporting on the one hand and practice on the other. We wish to emphasize that here, we are not suggesting what constitutes best practice for QC in metabolic phenotyping, but rather ways to standardize what information authors provide in manuscripts to document the QC components of their work. Knowing that studies were performed in an appropriate way helps to ensure that the data quality is unambiguous so that others may replicate (or improve) the findings; we call this Best Reporting Practice. Many laboratories routinely carry out far more in the way of QA and QC processes than they report in formal communications. If the spirit of good scientific method writing is that another group can replicate the experiment, then the essence of QA and QC reporting must be that other scientists can properly judge the quality of the reported data as fully as possible and be able to replicate the same data quality guidelines.The need to report the quality of data measurements is more vital than ever as metabolomics-based research is increasingly used as a justification for large clinical or environmental interventions (Bearden, 2012;Gowda &amp; Raftery, 2019).

        <p>Herein is a proposed set of minimal and best reporting practice standards for QA and QC practices for analytical sample analysis in untargeted metabolomics, focusing on the reporting of data from QC samples. Stages such as experimental design, metabolite identification, and other areas concerning data analysis to answer the biological questions/ develop hypotheses, will be the object of future recommendations. Current recommended reporting requirements, for example, on "design of metabolomics experiments" have been presented (Goodacre et al., 2007). Given that much of this data is collected routinely anyway, the burden of reporting could be largely mitigated by the use of templates such that important data are filled in as it is collected. When studies are published, these could be included as a supplementary data file, with only the most important aspects included in the main body of the paper. A draft template that can be found in Online Resources (Table OR1 and a modifiable Excel spreadsheet based on it) that may provide a suitable model for describing the QC samples analyzed and representative quality metrics obtained in the course of a study. For the time-constrained reader, we have also offered a summary of the overall recommendations of this paper in Online Resources (Table OR1) and their justification (Tables OR2 andOR3).Herein is a proposed set of minimal and best reporting practice standards for QA and QC practices for analytical sample analysis in untargeted metabolomics, focusing on the reporting of data from QC samples.

        <p>For every stage (or segment) in the development and execution of a metabolomics study, there are important QA and QC steps that should be carefully performed and documented. Detailed QA/QC protocols need to be defined that, for analytical data generation, cover the following at a minimum: sample processing, use and preparation/sources of different types of QC samples, instrumental analysis methods, QC acceptance criteria and post-analytical data processing prior to data quality scrutiny and acceptance. Each segment of a metabolic phenotyping study has specific issues that need to be addressed by considering potential sources of error that would invalidate it, and the QA/QC measures adopted to prevent or reduce errors need to be reported in line with previously agreed-to standards. Here, as indicated earlier, the focus is on the analytical QA/QC processes based, most commonly, on either 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or mass spectrometry (MS). MS-based analysis includes both direct infusion MS (DI/ MS or DIMS) (which is essentially a form of flow injection analysis (FIA)) and separation-based MS techniques, including liquid-(LC) and gas-chromatography (GC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). There are numerous other methodologies being developed for both MS and NMR, including imaging, direct analysis and in vivo modalities. However, currently the majority of published studies are based on GC-MS, LC-MS, direct infusion and high-resolution liquid state NMR spectroscopy and those modes serve as the basis for this report. As other approaches become more widely applied, the guidelines presented here should be adaptable enough to allow users of technologies not specifically covered here to report the quality metrics that were used with their analytical methods used.For every stage (or segment) in the development and execution of a metabolomics study, there are important QA and QC steps that should be carefully performed and documented.

        <p>In general, it is reasonable to expect that, whatever the method used, the analysis has been undertaken by a trained individual, that the procedure has been documented in detail (preferably with a written standard operating procedure (SOP)), that facilities are appropriate, the materials are of sufficient quality, and the equipment has been well maintained and appropriately used. Where SOPs are used it would clearly be of value to the community if, as best reporting practice, a version-controlled copy of the full SOP could also be supplied e.g., with DOI, Git or other accepted publication method. Reporting these details (and other QA aspects) as part of the manuscript QA section is crucial to strengthening the confidence of the report.In general, it is reasonable to expect that, whatever the method used, the analysis has been undertaken by a trained individual, that the procedure has been documented in detail (preferably with a written standard operating procedure (SOP)), that facilities are appropriate, the materials are of sufficient quality, and the equipment has been well maintained and appropriately used.

        <p>In targeted MS assays, where a specific analyte is measured, method validation gives an indication of the reliability of the data that will be acquired when the method is applied for the analysis of experimental samples. However, in untargeted profiling this is not possible as the analytical procedure aims to detect and measure an undefined number of metabolites, the identity of most of which are unknown. Despite this, it is possible to apply QC procedures that enable the continuous monitoring of measurement performance to demonstrate analytical precision or, on the other hand, highlights unexpected/unwanted deleterious changes. Having such data either allows verification of the analytical data, showing either that it met the quality requirements of the investigator, or did not, resulting in subsequent investigations to establish why the quality thresholds were not reached, and therefore what to do to improve the analyses. In Fig. 1 a QA/QC workflow that can be applied in untargeted metabolomics analyses is shown.In targeted MS assays, where a specific analyte is measured, method validation gives an indication of the reliability of the data that will be acquired when the method is applied for the analysis of experimental samples.

        <p>According to ISO/IEC 17025 "The resulting data should be recorded in such a way that trends are detectable. This monitoring should be planned. If the results of the analysis of data from monitoring activities are found to be outside pre-defined criteria, appropriate action shall be taken to prevent incorrect results from being reported". It is important to emphasize that "appropriate action" should be taken which can include removal of data for specific metabolites or samples, or full re-analysis of samples or data. These guidelines can be adopted in untargeted profiling in chromatography-MS studies by setting up a quality control program that includes monitoring and documentation of, for example, the following: the type and number of QC samples used, randomization strategies, sample run order, number and frequency of QC samples per analytical batch, instrument parameter(s) monitored such as e.g., LC pressure curves, statistical analysis used for QC samples, illustrations used e.g. batch drift visualization, and control limits (Broadhurst et al., 2018;Dudzik, et al., 2018;Gika et al., 2016).According to ISO/IEC 17025 "The resulting data should be recorded in such a way that trends are detectable.

        <p>A number of similar QC sample types exist to enable the signals present in samples to be tracked over the course of the analysis for trends in properties such as e.g., intensity, retention time and mass accuracy (Broadhurst et al., 2018;Dudzik, et al., 2018;Gika et al., 2007Gika et al., , 2012)). Based on the literature the most frequently used QC sample types are intra-and inter-batch pooled QC samples. There are also long-term QC samples to assess intra-lab repeatability or inter-lab reproducibility over a long period. These include inter-study QC samples to assess differences between separate studies on the same type of sample within one laboratory and inter-lab (between-laboratory) QC samples to assess differences between individual laboratories. No matter the way in which these matrix-matched QC samples are employed they have similar reporting requirements and are therefore considered together here.A number of similar QC sample types exist to enable the signals present in samples to be tracked over the course of the analysis for trends in properties such as e.g., intensity, retention time and mass accuracy (Broadhurst et al., 2018;Dudzik, et al., 2018;Gika et al., 2007Gika et al., , 2012)).

        <p>The intra-study (within-study) matrix-matched QC samples, usually pooled samples, are meant to be representative of the samples being studied (Sangster et al., 2006). Pooled samples are used because of relevance, relative ease of preparation, economy and the acute shortage of suitable commercial matrix-matched reference materials. They are normally prepared by pooling aliquots of all the biological samples to be analyzed (although if this is impractical it may be a "representative" selection, such as all the samples on a particular 96 well (or higher) plate, for example). Increasingly, laboratories are also running additional phenotypic intra-study QC samples (i.e., samples where each class is pooled separately). Phenotypic QC samples might be used to highlight differences in precision between experimental groups (especially in statistically unbalanced studies) vs control samples for signals differentiating between the classes (e.g., healthy vs disease). This might be the result of e.g., analytes having been "diluted out" in the study pool or are perhaps even entirely absent in one sample class, or so strongly elevated in concentration that they saturate the detector. Intra-study QC samples can be used in a single study batch (intra-batch) or across several batches from the same study (inter-batch) to enable the results for different batches of samples to be compared. Inter-batch QC samples may be used in short term studies that require several analytical runs to be performed over a few days, perhaps with preventative instrument maintenance carried out between runs. They may also be used by different laboratories that are collaborating on inter-laboratory trials. "Long Term Reference (LTR)" samples are analyzed across multiple batches often across multiple studies and are normally composed of bulk matrix samples (e.g., pooled plasma or urine from healthy donors). LTRs are generally used where many batches of samples, perhaps in several collaborating laboratories, are Fig. 1 One possible QC scheme for the use of QC samples in the analytical section of manuscripts describing untargeted mass spectrometry based metabolic profiling. Clearly a similar one could easily be constructed that covers other methodologies such as e.g., NMR spectroscopy etc.The intra-study (within-study) matrix-matched QC samples, usually pooled samples, are meant to be representative of the samples being studied (Sangster et al., 2006).

As such, LTRs do not necessarily replace "conventional" study derived QC samples because they may not be strongly matrix-matched. Such LTRs are currently generally prepared by those laboratories where they are employed or are purchased from a commercial supplier; for example, the NIST human plasma SRM 1950 could be used as an additional QC to facilitate comparison across multiple labs and studies. Whatever their source, assuming that they are consistent, LTRs act as a fixed comparison point between studies, and are ultimately the final arbitrator of data quality and comparability. The various types of QC in metabolic profiling studies described above are summarized in the Glossary and, in more detail, in Table OR 2. Clearly, the fact that the use of QC samples is now considered standard (Beger et al., 2019;Broadhurst et al., 2018) represents a welcome advance in analytical practice, but there remain wide variations in reporting. Reporting more typically involves more work, but increases the potential gain (Fig. 3). Irrespective of the type of QC sample(s) incorporated into the analysis, it is incumbent upon the authors to report what they were, how they were used and the criteria for acceptance. Thus, where QC samples have been used, Fig. 2 Information that should be documented in manuscripts to show the steps that have been taken to ensure the robustness of the analytical stages of a metabolic phenotyping experiment and its resulting data (see also Table OR3) we recommend that, as a minimum, the following should be reported:being assayed using the same methodology and there is the desire or intention to compare them or even to correct them (Bijlsma et al., 2006;Kamleh et al., 2012;Lewis et al., 2016;Zelena et al., 2009) to ensure comparability.

        <p>The preparation of QC samples for NMR spectroscopy studies is not too different from MS-based studies. But because there is no requirement for multiple internal standards for identification or quantification of analytes, any internal standards used should be carefully described and quantified. Typically, a bulk supply of solvent is prepared for a study for rehydration or dilution of experimental and QC samples immediately before analysis. The careful preparation of this bulk solvent, which may include a buffer, is crucial for quantification and replication across studies, so details of preparation should be reported. Minimum reporting should document the solvent, for example 10% D 2 O/90% H 2 O or 100% D 2 O; it is rare to use other solvents in biological metabolomics studies, but in lipidomics less-polar solvents such as CDCl 3 are often used. The chemical shift reference compound is usually added in this bulk solvent preparation to ensure uniform concentration across all the samples in the study, but if this is instead added as an extra step in the sample preparation from a concentrated stock solution, it is a crucial difference which must be reported clearly because the inherent errors in adding small volumes will affect any subsequent quantification. There are several chemical shift reference compounds commonly in use in NMR spectroscopy-based metabolomics, so it is crucial to positively identify which compound is used and its labeled deuteration level. Rarely, a project may include pH-indicating compounds or additional quantification internal standards; these should be fully described (name and concentration) in the QC report. Any analysis of the prepared bulk solvent by NMR spectroscopy (or other means) for impurities and suitability should be reported, noting whether this analysis was performed before any experimental samples were rehydrated, or diluted, with the bulk solvent to detect any inadvertent contamination.The preparation of QC samples for NMR spectroscopy studies is not too different from MS-based studies.

        <p>For 1 H NMR spectroscopy, system suitability testing is very closely related to instrument performance acceptance procedures which should be common practice for NMR spectroscopists. Details of the specific instrument tests performed must be reported as part of minimum reporting practice. A few examples of the tests that are necessary to demonstrate suitability of an NMR instrument before a project begins are: water suppression experiments, signal-tonoise assessments and temperature calibration experiments. While other approaches may be chosen, often these tests can all be addressed by meeting instrument specifications for a 2.0 mM sucrose sample in 10% D 2 O/90% H 2 O standard sample (ASTM International, 2015). The proper execution of a water suppression pulse sequence on this sample can be used to demonstrate that the quality of shimming, peak separation resolution, linewidth of the suppressed water resonance, 1 H pulse power calibration and spectral signal-to-noise ratio etc., shows that the instrument performance was suitable for acquiring spectra. The qualitative and quantitative results from a system suitability test using the sucrose sample, or other suitable samples, should be reported in the QC section of the report. System suitability is often performed during the batch runs on the included QC samples and on the experimental samples via automated scripts that evaluate spectral performance. Under automation, it is possible to assess the linewidth for each sample and also calibrate the 1 H pulse duration for each sample. If abnormalities are detected during the individual sample analyses, it is possible to rerun the sample, paying special attention to the automated shimming of the sample. The criteria for decisions on whether or not to rerun a sample and the timing of the rerun should be reported in the QC report. The average linewidth of the internal standard, signal-to-noise of the internal standard and pulse calibration width for the batch or project should be reported in the QC section of the report to demonstrate consistent performance of the instrument during the instrumental analysis phase of the project.For 1 H NMR spectroscopy, system suitability testing is very closely related to instrument performance acceptance procedures which should be common practice for NMR spectroscopists.

        <p>For minimal QC reporting, all critical details (instrumental and method parameters) that affect the analytical results should be reported unless it comes to a proprietary methodology where only selected information can be disclosed. In such cases, there should be a justification of why all method details are not given, and the QC results should be fully reported to enable readers to assess the method's fitness for purpose. As new instruments are continually developed, it is difficult to present a comprehensive reporting list without it quickly becoming out of date. Guidelines for reporting have been presented here, but individuals should report all methods in enough detail that another individual can repeat the analysis exactly on the same model instrument.

        <p>Term Definition Precision Performance characteristic of the analytical procedure that is applied to produce the untargeted spectral profiling data. It indicates the typical measurement variability of the repeated measurements of the same sample within a time period of a batch (repeatability) or over longer periods e.g., between batches (intermediate precision) and over a long period of time (intra-laboratory reproducibility). It can be assessed by designed replicate analysis of QC samples under the operational conditions and it is usually expressed by statistical parameters which describe the variability of the data e.g., the standard deviation or relative standard deviation of signals. Accuracy is not the same as precision as, unlike the latter, it cannot easily be determined in untargeted MS-based profiling as the identities and quantities of the solutes in the sample are not known prior to analysis.Term Definition Precision Performance characteristic of the analytical procedure that is applied to produce the untargeted spectral profiling data.

If the sample is a buffer aliquot, for example, it could be either a process blank or a true blank, depending on how it is handled. A process blank consists of a neat solvent, water, buffer etc., sample processed in exactly the same way as the samples. It can be used to examine the interferences or contamination introduced by the analytical system, columns, vials or the sample preparation step.

        <p>Often a synthetic mixture of metabolites, including representatives of the metabolites expected to be in the study samples. It can also be a mixture of exogenous compounds or xenobiotics that are easily or often detected in the analytical system used. System suitability test (SST) Analysis(es) performed before the analytical batch of the study samples to check that the analytical system is working appropriately and fit-for-purpose. It can be performed using QC samples or with a specific standard mixture (see above). Reference materials A reference material is a material which is sufficiently well characterized, homogenous and stable to be fit for its intended use in a measurement process. Reference material is a generic term. A certified reference material (CRM) has been additionally characterized by a metrologically validated procedure for specific characteristics which will be documented in an accompanying certificate including the allowable measurement uncertainty. A standard reference material (SRM) is a reference material certified to particular requirements laid down by the US National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST).Often a synthetic mixture of metabolites, including representatives of the metabolites expected to be in the study samples.
