        <p>Organic dyes in wastewater have become a serious problem threating environment and human health [1][2][3]. Up to date, numerous technologies have been developed to remove organic dyes from waste water, such as physical absorption [1,4], membrane filtration [5,6], chemical degradation [7] and biodegradation [8]. Among them, catalytic degradation of organic dyes using noble metal nanoparticles has attracted intensive attentions due to their outstanding catalytic activities and efficient color removal. However, there are several challenges limiting the practical use of these nanoparticle catalysts. For example, it is difficult to recycle these colloidal nanoparticles in aqueous solution for sustainable use [9]. Besides, the nanoparticles tend to aggregate because of their large surface area and high surface energy, which have strong negative effects on their chemical catalytic properties and stability [10].Organic dyes in wastewater have become a serious problem threating environment and human health [1][2][3].

        <p>Immobilization of noble metal nanoparticles on a support is considered as an effective approach to solve these above problems [11]. Nowadays, various materials have been employed as supports such as grapheme [12], Fe 3 O 4 microspheres [13], zeolites [14], polymeric microsphere [15], etc. These supports not only contribute to the dispersion and stabilization of nanoparticles but also improve the reusability of noble metal nanoparticles. However, these catalysts still need to be separated from the mixture solution for reuse after the catalytic reaction. Coupling the catalytic reaction and catalyst separation together, porous filtration membranes have been used as such a support of noble metal nanoparticles to perform flow-through catalytic reaction for the removal of dyes in aqueous solutions [16]. For example, Subair et al. have synthesized gold nanoparticles on the microfiltration membrane for continuous flow-through catalytic degradation of organic dyes, which exhibited sustained catalytic activities and maintained more than 99% degradation efficiency after 11 cycles [17]. The membrane matrix provides numerous pores to load large amount of nanoparticles ensuring high catalytic efficiency. Unfortunately, there is a trade-off between the flux and catalytic efficiency due to a short residence time of a dye-containing solution in a filtration membrane. Generally, the membrane flux needs be maintained at a relatively low value to ensure the complete reduction of dyes (lower than 500 L m -2 h -1 to maintain 99% degradation efficiency) [17][18][19]. Thus, the system efficiency of catalytic reduction is limited. It is desirable to further improve the flux of the flow-through catalytic system while maintaining nearly 100% reduction of dyes. Fibrous materials have a great potential to outperform better than porous filtration membranes when they are used as supports in the flow-through catalytic system due to the high specific surface area, high loading capacity of catalysts and high permeability [7,20,21]. Fibrous cellulose materials, such as cotton, have unique features of good chemical stability, high porosity and good flexibility, and can be a good choice as the candidate support.Immobilization of noble metal nanoparticles on a support is considered as an effective approach to solve these above problems [11].

        <p>Immobilization of nanoparticles on a filtration support offers interesting possibilities for the flow-through catalysis reaction. It is worth noting that the nanoparticles leaching from support can significantly reduce the performance of catalysis [7]. To firmly bind the nanoparticles to the support, the surface of support is engineered using the anchors of nanoparticles such as amino groups [22], thiol groups [23], polyelectrolytes [24], etc. However, these methods are complicated and the loading of nanoparticles is very low. Recently, inspired by the mussel bio-adhesion strategy, several research groups have successfully synthesized noble metal nanoparticles on supports via the first polydopamine deposition and the following nanoparticles generation to achieve the flow-through catalytic reduction of organic dyes [7,18]. However, this method still requires two steps and complex procedures. In order to improve the simplicity and universality of the nanoparticles functionalization onto the supports, we developed a one-step facile method to synthesize and immobilize of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) onto diverse supports [25]. The loading amount of Ag NPs was higher than most of the reported results. Besides, even under the condition of water flushing, the Ag NPs were still tightly bound to the support due to the adhesive nature of polydopamine.Immobilization of nanoparticles on a filtration support offers interesting possibilities for the flow-through catalysis reaction.

Ag NPs were one-step immobilized on cotton by immersing the cotton into a mixture solution of silver nitrate, poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether thiol (PEG-SH) and dopamine.

        <p>The Ag NPs were one-step synthesized and immobilized on cotton via immersing the cotton into a mixture solution of silver nitrate, PEG-SH and dopamine. During this process, dopamine served as a reducing agent and PEG-SH as a stabilizing agent. In the absence of PEG-SH, silver ions were reduced by dopamine, followed by precipitation immediately. This is due to the strong reducing capacity of dopamine and the strong oxidizing ability of silver ions. With the increasing of PEG-SH concentration from 0.1 mM to 10 mM, the size of Ag NPs in the bulk solution decreased from 216.7 nm to 11.7 nm (Fig. S2). The PEG-SH could chelate silver ions via the thiol group, which slowed down the reduction process to synthesize Ag NPs in a controllable manner [25]. The influences of dopamine concentration and AgNO 3 concentration on controlling the size of Ag NPs were further investigated and results were shown in Table S1. With the increasing of dopamine concentration from 0.2 mg mL -1 to 20 mg mL -1 , the size of Ag NPs in the bulk solution increased from 30.1 nm to 311.4 nm. Similarly, with the increasing of AgNO 3 concentration from 0.2 mM to 200 mM, the size of Ag NPs in the bulk solution increased from 23.1 nm to 284.1 nm. The low concentration of precursors may result in a long modification time. While, the high concentration of precursors may result in an uncontrollable reaction and synthesis of large particles. Therefore, the condition (1 mM PEG-SH, 2 mg mL -1 DOPA and 20 mM AgNO 3 ) was selected to synthesize Ag NPs in the range of nanometer size.The Ag NPs were one-step synthesized and immobilized on cotton via immersing the cotton into a mixture solution of silver nitrate, PEG-SH and dopamine.

        <p>After Ag NPs functionalization, the color of cotton turned from white to brown as shown in Fig. 1A andD. The surface morphology of cotton and cotton@Ag NPs were further characterized using SEM. As shown in Fig. 1B andE, both cotton and cotton@Ag NPs show a fibrous structure consisting of fiber with an average diameter about 15 μm and nanoparticles with an average diameter about 20 nm. From the high magnification SEM images shown in Fig. 1C andF, the pristine cotton fibers have a smooth surface. After Ag NPs functionalization, numerous bright nanoparticles were distributed on the surface of cotton fibers. In addition, the signal of silver element was found in the EDX spectrum of cotton@Ag NPs as shown in Fig. S3, confirming the successful immobilization of Ag NPs on cotton.

The role of the Ag NPs is to facilitate the electron transfer from electron donor to electron acceptor [28]. For the control experiments using the pristine cotton, the absorbance intensity of MB solution decreased slightly as shown in Fig. 2B, which is attributed to the adsorption of cotton. Fig. 2C shows the linear relationship between ln(C t /C 0 ) and the reaction time, confirming the pseudo first-order kinetics of the MB solution color removal when using the pristine cotton and cotton@Ag NPs. The slope of the line in Fig. 2C shows the catalytic rate constant K. The larger the absolute value of K is, the faster the catalytic reaction rate is. The K value for MB catalytic reduction using cotton@Ag NPs was calculated to be 0.478 min -1 . While, the K value for pristine cotton was only 0.014 min -1 , which is mainly due to the absorption of MB in pristine cotton without the catalytic reaction involved. Moreover, the loading amount of Ag NPs on support is an important factor affecting the catalytic rate [18]. Our previous study showed that the loading amount of Ag NPs loading on support increased with prolonging the immersion time of the support in the AgNO 3 /mPEG-SH/DOPA solution [25]. Fig. S7 shows that both the number of Ag NPs and the size of Ag NPs increased significantly.

Fig. 2D shows that the K value increased from 0.024 min -1 to 0.478 min -1 with prolonging the immersion time of cotton in the AgNO 3 /mPEG-SH/DOPA solution from 1 h to 4 h, which is due to the increased loading of Ag NPs on cotton providing more available surface areas for catalytic reaction.

        <p>filtrate was monitored by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. As shown in Fig. 3, the absorbance peak of MB in the filtrate at 665 nm disappeared and the MB was completely reduced after the feed solution of MB flowed through the catalyst of cotton@Ag NPs at the flux of lower than 2000 LMH. The absorbance peak of MB in the filtrate at 665 nm started to be detected when the flux was higher than 2000 LMH, and the concentration of MB in the filtrate increased when the flux was higher. It is worth noting that under the flow-through conditions with rapid convective mass transport of reactants to the immobilized Ag NPs, the reduction efficiency of MB depends on the kinetics or mass flow, rather than diffusion. With the increasing of the flux from 500 LMH to 2000 LMH, the reduction efficiency of MB maintained to be higher than 99%. The reduction efficiency of MB declined from 98.1% to 87.1% with further increasing the flux from 2500 LMH to 4000 LMH, which is mainly due to the decreased residence time of MB solution with the cotton@Ag NPs catalyst. The degradation of dyes at the high flux is of great significance for the practical application in environmental remediation. The concentration of MB and NaBH 4 are two important factors affecting the degradation efficiency. The concentration of MB and NaBH 4 can also be optimized to achieve the better performance of catalyst [17,26].filtrate was monitored by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

        <p>Compared with the performances of the reported flow-through catalytic systems, our cotton@Ag NPs catalyst based system exhibited a distinctive high flux (2000 LMH) while maintaining a super high reduction efficiency (&gt; 99%). For example, Hu et al. prepared the Ag NPs-modified porous polypropylene membrane and achieved the best performance at the flux of about 210 LMH when used for the flowthrough catalytic reduction of MB [19]. Subair et al. developed the gold nanoparticles incorporated poly (ethylene terephthalate) membrane for the catalytic degradation of organic dyes and obtained more than 98% degradation for MB at the flux of 473 LMH [17]. Therefore, our catalytic flow system of cotton@Ag NPs performed far better than the reported ones, which is mainly because of a high loading capacity of Ag NPs and very loose fibrous structure of cotton having a high surface area.Compared with the performances of the reported flow-through catalytic systems, our cotton@Ag NPs catalyst based system exhibited a distinctive high flux (2000 LMH) while maintaining a super high reduction efficiency (&gt; 99%).

        <p>To evaluate the sustainable catalytic performance of cotton@Ag NPs, the continuous flow-through catalytic reaction was performed under the flux of 2000 L m -2 h -1 . The feed solution (MB 50 mg mL -2 , NaBH 4 0.02 M) flowed through the cotton@Ag NPs and every 20 mL permeate solution was taken out to measure the concentration of MB and thus to calculate the reduction efficiency of MB. Fig. 4A observes a very high reduction efficiency of MB during the flow-through catalytic reaction and presents a very small decline of the MB reduction efficiency from 99.9% to 94.6% after 260 mL permeate was collected when 12.6 mg MB was reduced. For the pristine cotton, although the reduction efficiency of MB reached to 60.9% during the first 20 mL of filtrate due to the MB adsorption in cotton, and then rapidly decreased to zero when the permeate volume reached to 40 mL and above, because of the absorption saturation of MB in cotton. These results confirm that the cotton@Ag NPs is capable of performing highly efficient and long-term catalytic reduction of MB in the flow-through condition.To evaluate the sustainable catalytic performance of cotton@Ag NPs, the continuous flow-through catalytic reaction was performed under the flux of 2000 L m -2 h -1 .

        <p>The long-term catalytic performance of cotton@Ag NPs was also investigated in the static condition for many cycles. During one cycle of the test, the reduction efficiency of MB was measured upon incubating 50 mg cotton@Ag NPs with the feed solution containing 10 mL MB solution (50 mg mL -1 ) and 0.02 M NaBH 4 for 10 min. For the next cycle of the test, the solution in the system was emptied through centrifugation, and another 10 mL of fresh feed solution was filled to incubate with cotton@Ag NPs, the performance of cotton@Ag NPs was evaluated in terms of the MB reduction efficiency following the same protocol as above. Fig. 4B illustrates that the reduction efficiency of MB was stably high above 98% during the first 10 cycles when 4.9 mg of MB was reduced, indicating the long-term high catalytic performance of cotton@Ag NPs and the good reusability of cotton@Ag NPs. The reduction efficiency of MB decreased gradually to 85.4% with further increasing the cycle number from 10 to 20, suggesting a slow deterioration of catalytic properties of cotton@Ag NPs. The decreases of catalytic reduction efficiency in both flow-through mode and static condition may be attributed to the following two reasons: the loss of Ag NPs and the passivation of Ag NPs. It has been reported that the noble metal nanoparticles could be passivated during the catalytic reaction [29]. The binding of reaction product onto their surface may reduce their catalytic activities. Such phenomenon can be alleviated by a simple ethanol cleaning [19,30].The long-term catalytic performance of cotton@Ag NPs was also investigated in the static condition for many cycles.

        <p>To investigate the long-term stability of cotton@Ag NPs, the flowthrough catalytic reaction was carried out at the flux of 2000 LMH using the MB solution (50 mg mL -1 ) containing 0.02 M NaBH 4 as the feed solution, and the concentration of silver ions in the filtrate was measured using ICP-MS. Fig. 5 shows the release profile of silver ions from cotton@Ag NPs during the flow-through catalytic reaction. At the initial stage of the experiment, the concentration of silver ions in the filtrate was 34.1 ppb when the permeate volume was 50 mL, and then decreased rapidly with the increase of permeate volume to 300 mL, exhibiting a fast release behavior of silver from cotton@Ag NPs at the beginning of the flow-through operation. Then, the concentration of silver ions in the filtrate slowly decreased to be 7.1 ppb with increasing the permeate volume of MB solution to 1400 mL, which are lower than the maximal contaminant limit of silver ions (100 ppb) in drinking water [31]. Moreover, the amount of the accumulative silver ions after 24 h test was 16.2 μg, which was calculated to be only 0.9% of the total silver loading mass on cotton. This result suggests that about 99.1% of silver was still in the form of cotton@Ag NPs and the cotton@Ag NPs has a great potential to be long-term stable and active. To further investigate the silver leaching from cotton@Ag NPs, the morphologies of cotton@Ag NPs before and after 20-cycles test were observed using SEM. As shown in Fig. 6, a slight decrease in the number of Ag NPs is observed, which is responsible for the relative fast loss of Ag NPs during the initial test. Our previous study also shows that not only PEG-SH but also polydopamine were found on the surface of Ag NPs [25]. The Oand N-based groups in polydopamine could serve as anchors for Ag NPs, which improves the stability of Ag NPs. Therefore, we propose that the decrease of catalytic reduction efficiency is mainly due to the passivation of Ag NPs.To investigate the long-term stability of cotton@Ag NPs, the flowthrough catalytic reaction was carried out at the flux of 2000 LMH using the MB solution (50 mg mL -1 ) containing 0.02 M NaBH 4 as the feed solution, and the concentration of silver ions in the filtrate was measured using ICP-MS.

        <p>The stability of cotton@Ag NPs was also investigated by the treatment with acid and base solution. The cotton@Ag NPs was immersed in 0.01 M HCl or 0.01 M NaOH for 12 h and then washed with deionized water. During this process, no obvious structural collapse of cotton was observed (Fig. S8). The cotton@Ag NPs was treated in the abovementioned acid and base conditions for 12 h and then washed with deionized water thoroughly. The catalytic reduction experiments were performed to evaluate the catalytic activities of cotton@Ag NPs upon acid or base treatment. As shown in Fig. S9, the acid treated cotton@Ag NPs still exhibited excellent catalytic activities. The catalytic rate constant K of the acid treated cotton@Ag NPs was 0.453 min -1 , which was slightly lower than the catalytic rate constant K (0.478 min -1 ) of the untreated cotton@Ag NPs. While, the K value of the base treated cotton@Ag NPs decreased to 0.263 min -1 . Generally, the Ag NPs was stable under base condition than under acidic condition. This unexcepted phenomenon is mainly due to the detachment of polydopamine coating from cotton and thus the loss of Ag NPs from cotton. It has been reported that polydopamine was detached more easily and quickly in the alkaline condition than in acidic condition, and the detachment of polydopamine was faster than the dissolution of Ag NPs.

        <p>In this study, Ag NPs was loaded on the low-cost natural support cotton through one step synthesis and immobilization of Ag NPs via the modified dopamine chemistry and then Ag NPs loaded cotton was used for the highly efficient flow-through catalytic reduction of MB. The synthesis and immobilization of Ag NPs on cotton was achieved by immersing the cotton into a mixture solution of silver nitrate, PEG-SH and dopamine and confirmed by the results of SEM and EDX. The MB solution (50 mg mL -1 ) was completely decolorized within 8 min when using cotton@Ag NPs (50 mg) as the catalyst and NaBH 4 (0.02 M) as the reducing agent, and the reaction rate constant K reached high up to 0.478 min -1 . Under the continuous flow condition, the cotton@Ag NPs exhibited highly efficient and sustainable catalytic performances at the high flux of feed solution filtrating through the catalyst. The reduction efficiency of MB maintained above 90% after 260 mL permeate solution was collected and tested at the flux of 2000 L m -2 h -1 , which is far better than the reported results (below 500 L m -2 h -1 ). The cotton@Ag NPs could be reused for 20 cycles with only 14.6% decline in the reduction efficiency of MB. Moreover, the Ag NPs on cotton had an excellent stability and released very slowly. 99.1% of silver was still in the form of cotton@Ag NPs after 24 h flowing-through test.
