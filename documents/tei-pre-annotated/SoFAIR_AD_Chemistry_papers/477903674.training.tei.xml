        <p>Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a type of artificial polymer, which have complementary cavities that are designed to bind a specific target molecule with a high degree of selectivity. Due to their effectiveness and stability, MIPs have found their way into many applications in medicine, chemistry, analysis and sensing fields. One of the most important modern uses of MIPs is the recognition of biological molecules of medical significance, which are called "biomarkers". The use of MIPs enables easy and rapid extraction and detection of these biomarkers from different biological matrices. There are multiple techniques that arose for synthesis of MIPs each with their own set of advantages and drawbacks. In this review, we discuss MIPs in detail including their different types, methods of synthesis, characterisation methods, common challenges, in addition to their applications in different fields with a focus on their use in the analysis of protein biomarkers.Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a type of artificial polymer, which have complementary cavities that are designed to bind a specific target molecule with a high degree of selectivity.

        <p>Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a type of polymers synthesized to identify a specific target molecule with high degree of selectivity. The identification of the target molecule resembles a "lock and key" model, in which MIPs act as the lock that is complementary in size, shape and functional groups orientation to the target molecule; the key [1].Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a type of polymers synthesized to identify a specific target molecule with high degree of selectivity.

        <p>In consequence to the various efforts made in the field of molecular imprinting, different types of MIPs were developed depending on the starting materials used in their synthesis or the technique of synthesis itself. For example, we find types like magnetic MIPs, which contain magnetic materials in its core [2,3], and fluorescent MIPs, which contain fluorescent element in their core or structure [4,5]. Most of the alterations to MIPs either in shape or structure are introduced by modifications to their method of synthesis. In addition, different characterisation methods can be used to identify the structure, shape, porosity and functionality of MIPs, all of which are important parameters to determine their usefulness. Nonetheless, the field of MIPs is full of obstacles, which need to be addressed and sought after for possible solutions. In our review, we discuss all these matters in depth and explore different methods and techniques employed in the course of MIPs production.In consequence to the various efforts made in the field of molecular imprinting, different types of MIPs were developed depending on the starting materials used in their synthesis or the technique of synthesis itself.

        <p>Since their recent development, MIPs have been widely investigated by researchers for various purposes. MIPs have been applied to extract and analyse different naturally occurring compounds [6][7][8], drug molecules [9][10][11], amino acids [12,13] and pesticides [14]. In addition to small molecules, MIPs have been also applied to larger molecules like peptides, proteins [15][16][17][18], and even bacteria and viruses [19][20][21]. Moreover, MIPs have been integrated with different sensing methods (electrochemical, optical, or surface plasmon resonance, etc.) to produce a "biosensor", which is considered a very useful and handy analytical tool to detect many bioactive compounds [22][23][24][25].Since their recent development, MIPs have been widely investigated by researchers for various purposes.

        <p>MIPs have been applied in a considerable amount of research papers to extract and quantify protein biomarkers. Owing to the advantages offered by MIPs, there is a huge focus on the development of MIPs of comparable selectivity to this of antibodies in order to be applied in the assay of different biomarkers. Herein, we focus on the research work published in the last ten years concerning the use of MIPs in the analysis of protein biomarkers. In addition, we took the liberty to highlight some of the perks and the challenges of some of these methods in our critical review section.MIPs have been applied in a considerable amount of research papers to extract and quantify protein biomarkers.

        <p>The term "Biomarker" is short for "biological marker", which can be defined as any substance found in the body (gene, protein or polysaccharide etc.) that can be of medical or biological significance. This substance can be a part of a normal physiological process or a biochemical pathway or be a result of abnormal pathological condition. Pathological conditions can either generate new molecules into the body or cause a significant decrease or increase in naturally occurring molecules in which case their concentration itself is the biomarker. According to this definition, biomarkers are like signals that give us insightful information about what is going on inside the body with minimal interference and less effort. These signals can also be warnings that a medical condition is evolving, which in turn provides us with a good diagnostic tool that enables early treatment of the condition, hence saving lives [26].The term "Biomarker" is short for "biological marker", which can be defined as any substance found in the body (gene, protein or polysaccharide etc.) that can be of medical or biological significance.

        <p>Biomarkers can be classified in different ways; the first classification is imaging and nonimaging biomarkers, where imaging biomarkers are the ones we get using different imaging techniques such as X-Rays, PET scans, and MRI. Whereas non-imaging biomarkers are those molecules that have biophysical measurable properties that can be found in different body fluids or tissues. The second classification of biomarkers is according to their nature, biomarkers can be genetic such as DNA, RNA or even a specific gene mutation. On the other hand, they can be protein in nature that vary in size between few Daltons to hundred thousand Daltons (e.g. immunoglobulins). They can also be of very specific nature such as polysaccharides, glycans or glycoproteins [27].Biomarkers can be classified in different ways; the first classification is imaging and nonimaging biomarkers, where imaging biomarkers are the ones we get using different imaging techniques such as X-Rays, PET scans, and MRI.

        <p>Another method of classification is according to their applications; in that sense we have diagnostic biomarkers, that can be used to detect specific diseases, antecedent biomarkers, that provide means of identifying people at high risk of developing a particular disease, disease prognosis biomarkers, which are most commonly used to follow the prognosis of cancers and chronic conditions. Finally, therapeutic drug monitoring biomarkers, which are used to determine if a drug or combination of drugs is useful for the treatment of a specific condition or to determine the need to adjust the drug doses according to the discovered biomarkers [27]Another method of classification is according to their applications; in that sense we have diagnostic biomarkers, that can be used to detect specific diseases, antecedent biomarkers, that provide means of identifying people at high risk of developing a particular disease, disease prognosis biomarkers, which are most commonly used to follow the prognosis of cancers and chronic conditions.

        <p>In addition, to their diagnostic role, biomarkers are very beneficial in the field of pharmacy and drug development where analyzing patients' and volunteers' biomarkers can predict who will respond better to a certain drug from efficacy and safety perspectives, determine the efficiency of newly discovered drugs, and help reduce the expenses and time of clinical trials [28].In addition, to their diagnostic role, biomarkers are very beneficial in the field of pharmacy and drug development where analyzing patients' and volunteers' biomarkers can predict who will respond better to a certain drug from efficacy and safety perspectives, determine the efficiency of newly discovered drugs, and help reduce the expenses and time of clinical trials [28].</p>
        <p>Biomarkers also play an important role in studying the effects of environmental pollution. Pollution biomarkers are defined as quantitative measure of the alterations that happen to a biological system compared to its normal status after exposure to a specific pollutant. Exposure to different environmental pollutants such as heavy metals and toxic gases can result in significant changes in certain physiological processes in the body, the early detection of these variations is useful as sensitive warnings of environmental hazards, before they become on a population scale [29]. Pollution biomarkers vary in specificity; some are very specific such as inhibition of aminolevulinic acid dehydratase that is triggered by exposure to lead, and some are not that specific such as DNA damage or mutations, which indicate exposure to many pollutants, however, in this case, different biomarkers profiling can give us the big image of what kind of pollutant is involved [29].Biomarkers also play an important role in studying the effects of environmental pollution.

        <p>The analysis of biomarkers has many advantages that makes it one of the most important topics of research nowadays. Biomarker research services market size is expected to reach 18.2 billion dollars by 2026, which proves that biomarker research is a promising field of study [30].The analysis of biomarkers has many advantages that makes it one of the most important topics of research nowadays.

        <p>Versatility of biomarkers is also a very good advantage; as more than one biomarker may be found for one medical condition, which can give more certainty about the diagnosis. Another advantage is the high selectivity, as most of the biomarkers usually signal a specific condition with a high degree of precision. Other beneficial merits include reproducibility and their presence in different body fluids and tissues, which enables easy extraction with no need for painful procedures. On the other hand, there are some challenges associated with the analysis of biomarkers, where the most common problem is cross-reaction, which mainly happens due to the poor selectivity of the analytical method. Another problem is that some of these biomarkers exist in very low concentration in body fluids that makes their extraction and analysis extremely challenging; this problem urges the development of very sensitive extraction and analytical methods for their detection. Moreover, a common challenge faced in biomarkers discovery is the low number of case studies involved in the early stages of a particular disease, since the early stages are mostly asymptomatic [31,32]Versatility of biomarkers is also a very good advantage; as more than one biomarker may be found for one medical condition, which can give more certainty about the diagnosis.

        <p>In order to analyse and quantify different molecular biomarkers in the body, different analytical tools are used, each method offers some advantages and disadvantages that technically depend on the biomarker itself and its concentration in the sample.In order to analyse and quantify different molecular biomarkers in the body, different analytical tools are used, each method offers some advantages and disadvantages that technically depend on the biomarker itself and its concentration in the sample.</p>
        <p>The most commonly used method up till now is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Despite the fact that ELISA is the most popular technique used up till now, it suffers from some drawbacks including false positive results with the negative controls when the used blocking solution is not effective, or false negative result when the concentration of the target is too low. In addition, ELISA assay usually requires a multistep sample dilution, washing and preparation that allows a wide field of error and also requires skilled personnel to handle the procedure. Furthermore, antibodies are unstable and require very low storage temperatures, which adversely affects easy application. Sandwich and competitive ELISA types usually offer very high sensitivity, however they are usually very expensive [33,34].The most commonly used method up till now is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

        <p>Other methods of biomarkers' analysis include different chromatographic techniques such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography (GC), and gel electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the problem with most chromatographic assays is that they cannot be applied directly to complex sample matrices such as blood or urine, therefore the target biomarker should be extracted first by a convenient way then injected into the chromatographic method for detection and quantification. Among the promising extraction techniques is the use of MIPs as sorbent material for selective extraction of target molecules, MIPs can be tailored to the target biomarker and be utilized to extract it from any complex matrix with high selectivity.Other methods of biomarkers' analysis include different chromatographic techniques such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography (GC), and gel electrophoresis.

        <p>Protein molecules by far are the most common biomarkers, since they are found in plethora in the human body. Different protein molecules, peptides, or single amino acids can signal a variety of diseases or cancer types. Protein biomarkers are also present mostly in relatively high concentration, which makes their extraction and detection more convenient [35]. For example, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 are types of tissue-based biomarkers that have been used for years to monitor the course of treatment of breast cancer, DX 21-gene panel is also useful to predict the risk of breast cancer recurrence and the potential benefit of chemotherapy [36]. The intracellular coenzymes NAD(P)H and FAD are involved in all intracellular metabolic pathways by oxidation and reduction reactions. Therefore, they are useful biomarkers for detection of metabolic dysfunctions that happen on the intracellular level and are main causes for many diseases such as diabetes. In addition, these coenzymes are fluorescent by nature, therefore they can be easily scanned without the need for sample pretreatment procedures [37].Protein molecules by far are the most common biomarkers, since they are found in plethora in the human body.

        <p>The identification of specific mutations in certain proteins such as receptors or enzymes can also help to detect or understand the cause of certain diseases or to target therapy to these specific proteins. For example, according to P. Villalobos et al. epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase enzyme translocations are promising and novel biomarkers for targeted molecular level therapies in a group of patients suffering from lung cancer [38].The identification of specific mutations in certain proteins such as receptors or enzymes can also help to detect or understand the cause of certain diseases or to target therapy to these specific proteins.

        <p>The process of synthesizing MIPs usually involves four main elements, which integrate to give the ultimate final structure. These elements are the functional monomer, the cross linker, the initiator, and the porogenic solvent.The process of synthesizing MIPs usually involves four main elements, which integrate to give the ultimate final structure. These elements are the functional monomer, the cross linker, the initiator, and the porogenic solvent.</p>
        <p>The core step of successful synthesis of MIPs is to establish a good interaction between the target molecule and the functional monomer, since this interaction is not only useful during synthesis of MIPs, but also during the rebinding of MIPs with the target molecule in different samples. Therefore, it is important to choose a functional monomer that has complementary functional groups to those in the target molecule. After the formation of the template-monomer adduct, the crosslinking agent acts like a glue or building block that brings the adducts together in a highly cross-linked polymeric structure as shown in Figure 1. No doubt that in order to start polymerisation, an initiator should be added to start a free radical reaction. Finally, the porogenic solvent is used to increase the porosity, which in turn increases the surface area of the formed polymer and enables easy access to the binding sites [1].The core step of successful synthesis of MIPs is to establish a good interaction between the target molecule and the functional monomer, since this interaction is not only useful during synthesis of MIPs, but also during the rebinding of MIPs with the target molecule in different samples.

        <p>The type of bond formed between the template and monomer can be of three types; covalent, non-covalent, and semi-covalent. In covalent imprinting, a reversible covalent bond is formed between the monomer and the target, before they are added to the polymerisation reaction mixture. This bond is then severed after polymerisation to remove the template molecules, and upon rebinding with the target, the covalent bond is re-established. Covalent imprinting is superior due to its high stability, which enables the use of different reaction conditions such as high temperatures or strong acidic conditions. However, the formation of covalent linkage is rather slow and requires a lengthy amount of time for template binding and release. On the other hand, non-covalent imprinting involves the use of weaker bonds such as: hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic, ionic, and hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent binding enables the adducts to be formed in situ in the reaction mixture and template molecules can be easily removed after polymerisation through the use of a suitable solvent. Non-covalent binding is much easier to achieve and is applicable to a wide range of targets, moreover, target binding and release is relatively fast. However, non-covalent binding also requires a thorough optimisation of reaction conditions to achieve maximum interaction between the target and the monomer. In addition, non-covalent binding requires the use of excess of monomer molecules to favour the formation of the adduct, yet that can result in the formation of non-specific binding sites that in turn reduces the selectivity of the resulting MIPs. A semicovalent method is basically an intermediate between the two methods in which the templatemonomer adduct is formed by a covalent bond with the rebinding utilizing non-covalent interactions. However, this approach is rarely used, since it is difficult to establish and optimise [39,40].The type of bond formed between the template and monomer can be of three types; covalent, non-covalent, and semi-covalent.

        <p>Pre-polymerisation studies refer to a set of experiments done prior to polymerisation to ensure the stability of the template-monomer adduct and study the effects of various physicochemical parameters. In the case of covalent imprinting, these studies aim at finding a suitable monomer that is able to form a stable covalent bond with the template molecule yet can be easily broken after polymerisation. Among the common covalent bonds that are used in this type of imprinting are Schiff base [41], acetals/ketals [42], or boronate esters [43]. Meanwhile, in case of non-covalent imprinting, weaker bonds are involved such as ionic, Van der Waals and hydrogen bonds, which are easier to achieve with various monomers and targets. In both cases of imprinting, various testing methods are applied to the prepolymerisation mixture (template with monomer and solvent). These tests are usually conducted using spectroscopic techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and ultraviolet (UV)-spectroscopy. Spectra are collected for template alone and for template-monomer adduct after equilibrium and compared. In most cases, a significant difference can be noticed between both spectra that can give useful information about formation of any bonds besides to their strength and stability. An example of applying UV-spectroscopy was introduced by S. Scorrano et al. when they studied the interaction between their template amino acid; Fmoc-3-nitrotyrosine and five different monomers. The produced spectra from titration of Fmoc-3 nitrotyrosine in acetonitrile solutions of the monomers revealed a strong bond with the template indicated by a hypochromic shift from the original spectrum of the template alone. Therefore, 4-vinylpyridine was chosen in this study, since it had the strongest and most stable interaction [12].Pre-polymerisation studies refer to a set of experiments done prior to polymerisation to ensure the stability of the template-monomer adduct and study the effects of various physicochemical parameters.

        <p>A more in depth prepolymerisation study is to compare different ratios of template to monomer in order to determine the most stable ratio. Using spectroscopic applications such as Job's method, binding isotherm and titration curves can reveal the nature of interaction, association constant (Ka) and coordination number of the complex [44].A more in depth prepolymerisation study is to compare different ratios of template to monomer in order to determine the most stable ratio.

        <p>Optimisation usually aims at various important goals including: favouring the formation of a stable template-monomer adduct, the formation of a uniform size and porous polymer particles, easy and complete template removal and rebinding, reducing non-specific binding, and maintaining the structural and conformational integrity of the target molecules especially the bulky ones such as proteins. Optimisation of MIPs synthesis involves changing the type and/or concentration of the template, functional monomer, cross linker, initiator and porogenic solvent (classical optimisation). Batch rebinding of template by the produced polymers is used as a measure for the optimum condition. Finally, some papers reported the use of software techniques such as an artificial neural network to carry out optimisation with minimal number of experiments and high accuracy [45].Optimisation usually aims at various important goals including: favouring the formation of a stable template-monomer adduct, the formation of a uniform size and porous polymer particles, easy and complete template removal and rebinding, reducing non-specific binding, and maintaining the structural and conformational integrity of the target molecules especially the bulky ones such as proteins.

        <p>The choice of monomer mainly depends on the template, where the monomer should have functional groups complementary to those in the template molecule. In the case of covalent imprinting, amides or esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid are most frequently employed, where templates are bound to the vinyl moieties of the monomer. However, in the case of non-covalent imprinting, similar vinyl monomers can be used if they contain functional groups that can interact with the template by hydrogen bonds. A very popular monomer is methacrylic acid (MAA), which is considered as a universal monomer due to its hydrogen bond donor and acceptor dual characteristics. Along with MAA, acrylic acid (AA), acrylamide (Am), and vinyl-pyridines (2-VP and 4-VP) are other commonly used monomers which can interact with a wide variety of templates. Structures of these monomers are illustrated in Figure 2a. 2a) is a special type of functional monomer, which has the advantage of thermosensitivity. Poly(NIPAm) polymers and hydrogels undergo volume phase transitions at lower critical temperatures (~32°C). Therefore, polymers made using NIPAm possess a reversible thermal transition response, which is useful to control the capture and release of template. M. Fang et al. prepared a fluorescent polymer using NIPAm. It was found that the polymer binding capacity was significantly higher at 28°C compared to 44°C because the polymer presents a hydrophilic and swelling state at 28°C, which enables easy access of the target molecules to the imprinted cavities [46]. Nonetheless, polymer chains prepared with NIPAm fold randomly during transition from extended coil structure to a collapsed globule structure, therefore the conformation of the newly formed globules might differ from the original one, which in turn can affect the structural selectivity of the polymer [47]. Some researchers reported synthesis of monomers that have a specific functionality to be used in MIPs. For example, W. Xu et al. reported synthesis of an imidazolium-based ionic liquid with vinyl groups that could provide multiple interaction with template molecules and hence increased selectivity [48].The choice of monomer mainly depends on the template, where the monomer should have functional groups complementary to those in the template molecule. In the case of covalent imprinting, amides or esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid are most frequently employed, where templates are bound to the vinyl moieties of the monomer.

        <p>Optimisation of a monomer's concentration is equally important to choosing its type. Association between the monomer and the template is controlled by an equilibrium, therefore it is preferred to add the functional monomer in excess to favour complex formation. However, we need to mention that too much monomer also results in the formation of multiple heterogeneous binding sites, which in turn reduces selectivity. Therefore, it is important to reach the optimum molar ratio, which in fact differs according to the nature of template, so we cannot recommend a specific ratio [53].Optimisation of a monomer's concentration is equally important to choosing its type.

        <p>A cross linker is the backbone of structural rigidity, which in turn allow MIPs to preserve their memory of the template after it is removed.

        <p>As simple as the role of cross linker might appear, its type and concentration should be carefully optimised. Firstly, the chosen cross linker should have a similar reactivity to the functional monomer, this ensures that none of them will polymerise predominantly and that polymerisation is random with uniform distribution of functional residues. Secondly, the concentration of cross linker should not be very low, as this reduces the mechanical stability of the resulting polymers, in addition the binding sites will be located too closely to each other, which will inhibit efficient binding. On the other hand, higher concentration of cross linker reduces the number of binding sites per unit mass of MIPs, besides to the destruction of selectivity in the case of the side non-covalent interactions between cross linker and template or cross linker and the monomer [54].As simple as the role of cross linker might appear, its type and concentration should be carefully optimised.

Therefore, changing the pH from 5.5 to 7.4 led to expansion of the imprinted cavities and easy template removal; restoring the pH to 5.5 returned the imprinted cavities to their original shape and size due to the precise peptide folding.Common cross linkers employed in MIPs synthesis are N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), and divinylbenzene (DVB) structures of which are illustrated in Figure 2b.

        <p>Cationic, anionic and free radical polymerisation reactions can all be applied for the synthesis of MIPs. However, free radical polymerisation is the most popular due to its experimental easiness and versatile applications. 2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) and 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (ADVN) (Figure 2c) are the most common azo initiators used in free radical polymerisation. The reaction is usually initiated thermally at temperatures ranging from 50 to 70 °C, however this temperature range can be hazardous to the stability of the monomer/template adduct or to the template itself (e.g., proteins). Therefore, photochemical initiation using UV light can be applied in such cases [55]. Some oxidizing agents have been applied as initiators in recent papers, mostly a mixture of a strong oxidizing agent and an accelerator such as potassium persulfate and sodium bisulfite mixture [18] or ammonium persulfate (APS) and N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethyl ethylenediamine (TEMED) mixture [4,56]. In all cases, dissolved oxygen in the reaction mixture must be removed prior to polymerisation simply by purging inert gas such as nitrogen or helium.Cationic, anionic and free radical polymerisation reactions can all be applied for the synthesis of MIPs.

        <p>The prime roles of porogenic solvent are to solubilize all the starting materials of the reaction and act as a pore forming agent in the resulting MIPs. Solvent molecules are trapped in the polymers and are removed after drying, which leaves behind pores. These pores are beneficial for easy access of template to the binding sites. The polarity of the solvent is an important influential factor, especially in non-covalent imprinting. Solvents should promote the formation of bonds between template and monomer; therefore, it is advisable to use nonpolar aprotic solvents. Chloroform, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran and toluene are common porogenic solvents used for successful non-covalent imprinting.

Eventually when the polymer particles exceed a certain size, they start to precipitate from the solution. As a result, spherical particles with uniform particle size are obtained usually with a diameter less that one micrometre.

Herein, the binding sites of MIPs are formed on the surface of a solid substrate or around nano/micro sized solid particles. As implied from this description, surface imprinting provides a great advantage namely the readily accessible binding sites, since the target molecules do not have to migrate through the complex structure of MIPs formed by bulk imprinting. Therefore, binding of target is not diffusion limited, which enables easy and rapid binding and release. Consequently, this technique is very popular for imprinting of large molecules and proteins. However, it also suffers from some drawbacks including the smaller number of available binding sites per unit area, which in turn can reduce sensitivity.

The procedure is quite simple; the pre-polymerisation mixture is spotted on the surface of a solid substrate usually a glass slide. The solution is then squeezed between the glass slide and soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) mold. Suitable pressure is applied, and UV light is used to initiate the reaction. As a result, thin patterned polymeric films are formed and then dried. After the removal of the template by a suitable solvent, thin layered MIPs films with highly accessible and complementary binding sites are obtained. Moreover, the presence of the stamped patterned network on the MIPs film increases the exposed surface area and hence increases the binding capacity [89,90].In soft lithography, nano/micro scaled patterned MIPs films are formed on solid substrates using a soft polymeric stamp.

        <p>Fluorescent core shell MIPs should not be confused with fluorescent bulk imprinted MIPs. The later type utilizes florescent monomers or fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein to impart the fluorescent nature. Therefore, the fluorescent element is part of the polymeric material itself and not incorporated in its core [103]. In this type of MIPs, an increase in fluorescence intensity might be noticed in some cases upon binding to the target, which is more analytically accurate than the quenching effect [104]. Some papers combined both fluorescent and magnetic qualities in the structure of the developed MIPs.

        <p>In this technique, template molecules are immobilised onto a solid support by chemical bonds. Therefore, after polymerisation, the solid support can be removed along with the immobilised template molecules leaving complementary binding sites on the MIPs surface. Thus, the immobilisation of template molecules gives some major advantages; firstly, the immobilisation ensures that the binding sites are all on the surface and well oriented for rebinding of target. Secondly, this technique is useful for insoluble templates, since they do not need to be incorporated in the solvent. Finally, the immobilisation of template via chemical bonds enables complete and easy template removal after polymerisation without the need for excessive washing cycles [107,108].In this technique, template molecules are immobilised onto a solid support by chemical bonds.

        <p>Micro-contact imprinting is a method that rely on template immobilisation that was introduced in 2005 that is quite simple and effective [109]. Micro-contact imprinting depends on the immobilisation of target molecules on a glass cover slip via covalent bonds. The cover slip is then exposed to the functional monomer to form the prepolymerisation mixture; as to orientate the functional groups of the monomer towards the template molecules in a sitespecific manner and create a strong template monomer adduct. Cross linker and initiator are dissolved in the porogenic solvent and spotted as a small drop on a glass slide. The imprinting process then starts by bringing the cover slip in contact with the glass slide and exposing it to UV radiation. After polymerisation, the cover slip is removed and unreacted monomers along with any template molecules that could have leaked into the surface are washed away. Microcontact imprinting provides an easy way for rapid and simultaneous polymerisation of many templates at the same time. In addition, it is a very useful technique for expensive samples that are only available in scarce amounts, since the procedure requires a minimal amount of template molecules. Due to the previously mentioned advantages, micro-contact imprinting has been successfully used to imprint different target molecules, especially proteins [110][111][112].Micro-contact imprinting is a method that rely on template immobilisation that was introduced in 2005 that is quite simple and effective [109].

        <p>Solid phase imprinting of MIPs is a very innovative and promising technique that depends on template immobilisation as well. In this imprinting method, the template is immobilised via covalent bonds onto the surface of functionalised activated glass beads. The glass beads bearing the template are then brought in contact with the prepolymerisation mixture to initiate the reaction. The polymerisation conditions are set to produce MIPs nanoparticles instead of films; conditions such as high dilution and short polymerisation times are favourable to produce nanoparticles. After polymerisation, the solid support plays another important role, which is acting as an affinity medium (somehow like chromatographic stationary phase). The immobilisation of template on the solid support allows for the removal of unreacted monomers, and low affinity polymer particles from the high affinity nanoMIPs. This is achieved by washing the glass beads under specific conditions in which the nanoMIPs remain attached while the other unreacted components elute from the system. After successful washing, detachment of nanoMIPs from the glass beads is carried out by washing under a different set of conditions, usually higher temperature and different solvent, after which nanoMIPs are eluted with complementary binding sites and complete template removal [113]. Figure 4 shows the process of solid phase imprinting and separation of nanoMIPs. Although the yield from this imprinting method is usually small, their binding affinity is much higher than MIPs produced using other imprinting methods. In addition, the yield can be increased by carrying out several cycles of synthesis using the same system, which can be turned into an automated procedure.

        <p>• Controlled/living radical polymerisation During free radical polymerisation, there is a high concentration of generated radicals, which results in very fast chain propagation. Consequently, premature chain termination cannot be controlled, which in turn causes the generation of varying length polymer chains. The varying polymer chains are the reason for the broad size distribution of MIPs produced using the free radical mechanism. Moreover, if the monomer has a different radical reactivity than the cross linker, this is will definitely cause a variation in the distribution and orientation of functional groups in MIPs. Because of these reasons, controlled/living radical polymerisation (CRP) technique has been introduced in the field of the molecular imprinting. CRP depends on the use of temporary radical capping agents (dormant species), which aim to protect the radicals from premature termination. By using capping agents, propagation chains are given the time to grow at the same rate and simultaneously until termination, therefore the resulting polymer chains have almost the same size and very narrow size distribution range. One more advantage of CRP is the introduction of living functional groups to the polymer chain end, which can be used to further modify the MIPs structure [118][119][120].• Controlled/living radical polymerisation During free radical polymerisation, there is a high concentration of generated radicals, which results in very fast chain propagation.

        <p>One method to study binding selectivity is to compare the binding of MIPs against the binding of NIPs. This comparison confirms the presence of specific binding sites in MIPs for the target that are absent in NIPs.

        <p>However, comparison to NIPs may not be the best way to ensure selectivity of MIPs. This can be attributed to two main reasons. Firstly, the structure of NIPs tends to be more compact due to the absence of template during polymerisation, therefore the number of available free binding functional groups is by nature less than MIPs. Secondly, a published study has shown that during optimisation of MIPs synthesis, the optimum composition of MIPs that has the highest binding capacity corresponds to NIPs that bind the target strongly as well [134].However, comparison to NIPs may not be the best way to ensure selectivity of MIPs.

        <p>When discussing binding kinetics, we must make an important note that binding/release of target to MIPs is a diffusion limited process. In other words, molecules of target need to undergo mass transfer from solution phase to solid phase of MIPs. This can be a very slow process, since molecules need to cross the porous solid polymeric network to access the binding sites. In the case of surface imprinting, binding is usually faster, since binding sites are on the surface and readily accessible [135].When discussing binding kinetics, we must make an important note that binding/release of target to MIPs is a diffusion limited process.

        <p>The best way to calculate binding kinetics is to carry out a batch rebinding assay for both MIPs and NIPs.

The difference between MIPs' and NIPs' curves is attributed to the specific binding of MIPs due to the presence of selective binding sites. Therefore, optimisation is carried out to maximize the difference between the two isotherms, which is reflected on the selectivity of MIPs.Where ntarget is the total number of target mols used in the experiment.

        <p>Among the most important merits provided by MIPs are their stability, which enables their use under different sets of non-physiological conditions. Moreover, they can be stored for a long time at ambient temperature with no damage, degradation or loss of target recognition efficiency. In addition, the process of synthesis of MIPs is a far more cost effective and time saving procedure compared to production of antibodies. These advantages are very economically appealing traits, especially when MIPs are designed to be produced on an industrial scale. Furthermore, as we previously mentioned, MIPs can be easily functionalised with fluorescent or magnetic labels, they can also be manufactured as films, particles or nanotubes, therefore they can be tailored according to the intended use to maximize their potential, which is something that cannot be achieved with antibodies [137]. A recent study by K. Smolinska-Kempisty et al. has compared the performance of nanoMIPs against antibodies used in an ELISA assay to a specific target. The results proved that nanoMIPs are equally effective or even better than antibodies, which makes them better candidates for industrial diagnostic applications [138].Among the most important merits provided by MIPs are their stability, which enables their use under different sets of non-physiological conditions.

        <p>Binding site heterogeneity is considered an inevitable setback when developing MIPs. This problem usually results in MIPs that are "polyclonal" in nature, thus they might exhibit non-specific binding with other species in the target sample.

        <p>The drawback of binding site heterogeneity is caused by different factors and in almost all types of imprinting, yet it is more prominent in non-covalent imprinting. One of the obvious reasons for this problem is that the monomer-template interaction is a process governed by equilibrium. Therefore, during equilibrium, prepolymerisation mixture in fact contains too many species of template-monomer interactions, different complex ratios, not just 1:1, in addition to free monomers. Furthermore, some side interactions occur between the template and cross linker, or between the monomer and the cross linker or even between template molecules themselves forming clusters. These chaotic species occurring in the prepolymerisation mixture are translated into the final polymer, forming many non-specific binding sites. However, another array of factors also contributes to binding site heterogeneity after polymerisation, this includes grinding and sieving of polymer, template removal process, and using different solvents during rebinding experiments. All these factors cause further heterogeneity by damaging the binding sites, collapsing sites after template removal, and variable swelling/collapsing of the polymer upon exchange of the solvent [139]. Figure 5 is a cartoon representation of how heterogenic binding sites can be generated during polymerisation and after.The drawback of binding site heterogeneity is caused by different factors and in almost all types of imprinting, yet it is more prominent in non-covalent imprinting.

        <p>Semi-covalent imprinting is considered a very promising imprinting method to reduce binding site heterogeneity to the minimum. Since this method combines the merit of covalent binding (control on the template-monomer interaction) and the merit of non-covalent release (reduced kinetic restriction), the method offers better control of the functional groups orientation on the binding sites and therefore reduces the resultant heterogeneity [39,40].Semi-covalent imprinting is considered a very promising imprinting method to reduce binding site heterogeneity to the minimum.

        <p>Stoichiometric non-covalent imprinting is another useful approach to reduce binding site heterogeneity. This approach was introduced first by Wulff et al. [140] and depends on reaching a high association constant between template and monomer, this is achieved by choosing a functional monomer that is capable of forming two or more hydrogen bonds with the template. Using this method, we combine the high splitting yields and rapid binding kinetics of non-stoichiometric, non-covalent imprinting with the precise control over functional groups orientation and good accessibility to binding sites of typical covalent imprinting [141].Stoichiometric non-covalent imprinting is another useful approach to reduce binding site heterogeneity.

        <p>As mentioned before, after successful molecular imprinting, template removal should be attempted using a suitable solvent or reagent. In the case of inefficient template removal, some of the template molecules remain stuck to MIPs' binding sites. Under these circumstances, the entrapped template molecules can be released later during the application of MIPs to their intended purpose in a phenomenon known as template bleeding or "template leakage". Template bleeding is another problem that significantly hinders the applications of MIPs in the field of sensors and chromatographic separations. This is because if the attached template molecules are released during the sensing process, a false positive result can be obtained. Moreover, in the case of chromatographic separations, template bleeding can cause a poor chromatographic separation and possible contamination of the fractionated sample components [139,143].As mentioned before, after successful molecular imprinting, template removal should be attempted using a suitable solvent or reagent.

        <p>There are some proposed solutions for the problem of template bleeding including isotope molecular imprinting, microwave assisted extraction or carrying out a blank extraction [144].

        <p>Dummy imprinting is a process that refers to the imprinting of a compound that is structurally similar to the target compound instead of the target itself. There are two types of dummy imprinting: firstly, fragment imprinting, which utilizes a part of the target molecules as the dummy [145]. Secondly, interval immobilisation imprinting, which utilizes an entirely different compound than the target, however this compound has the same distance between two identical functional groups to the target compound [146]. Using either of the dummy imprinting approaches, if template leakage occurs, it will have no significant effect on the result or the accuracy of the testing method. In addition, dummy imprinting is a very suitable alternative if the template is expensive, dangerous or unstable. Nevertheless, dummy imprinting is not always a viable solution, since finding suitable dummies is not always simple.Dummy imprinting is a process that refers to the imprinting of a compound that is structurally similar to the target compound instead of the target itself.

        <p>Hydrophilic and polar compounds present a challenge when they are used as templates for MIPs, since they are practically insoluble in organic solvents. Across the years, researchers came up with few effective solutions for the problem of hydrophilic template imprinting. Among the first proposed solutions is the structural modification of the template molecule to introduce a hydrophobic alkyl chain; using this approach the solubility of the template in organic solvent is expected to increase [148]. However, the process of structural modification is time consuming and may alter the functional groups needed for imprinting. Another approach is the use of a hydrophobic dummy as an alternative for the original target, yet finding a suitable dummy is not always easy. Up till now, the simplest and the most effective approach for imprinting hydrophilic templates is using ion-pairs. This technique relies on the formation of ion pair between the hydrophilic template and a surfactant. Following the formation of the ion pair, it is extracted by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) using organic solvent and molecular imprinting proceeds as normal [149].Hydrophilic and polar compounds present a challenge when they are used as templates for MIPs, since they are practically insoluble in organic solvents.

        <p>Solving the problem of imprinting of polar templates does not necessarily mean that the developed MIPs can be applied in aqueous media. MIPs developed in organic solvents show weak recognition to the target in water or polar samples due to the disrupted hydrogen bonds. Micro liquid-liquid extraction is a useful way to extract the template molecules from their aqueous samples using minimum amount of organic solvent and then the extracted target is loaded onto the solid MIPs [150]. Another reasonable approach is to use hydrophilic monomers for the synthesis of MIPs for polar templates.

        <p>Recently, there have been a trend to utilize green and natural polymeric materials in the synthesis of MIPs.

        <p>A special class of MIPs, which are prepared using a metal coordination bond between template and the functional monomer can be effectively used in polar solvents; owing to the fact that metal coordination is a strong bond that is not easily disrupted by water molecules unlike hydrogen bonds. 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine MIPs were prepared utilizing metal coordination bond. Methacryloylamidohistidine-platinum(II) was used as the metal chelating monomer and therefore rebinding of template depended on formation of coordinate bonds.

        <p>The challenges posed by proteins as targets exceed the normal challenges encountered with other hydrophilic templates. The large molecular weight of proteins ranging from a few Daltons to thousands of kilo Daltons is considered a big problem in protein imprinting; The large molecular weight of proteins makes it difficult for protein molecules to diffuse through the highly cross-linked polymeric structure, this results in very slow binding kinetics. Moreover, the large molecular weight may also impede the efficient template removal after MIPs synthesis causing the phenomenon of template bleeding or reducing binding efficiency. Furthermore, proteins have poor solubility in organic solvents, which are commonly used in molecular imprinting and they are by nature sensitive to the extreme conditions required for radical polymerisation, such as elevated temperatures and different pHs. Therefore, protein imprinting needs to be carried out in conditions, which are similar to their natural physiological conditions, not only to prevent their degradation but also to maintain their conformational integrity [139]. In addition to the aforementioned difficulties, protein molecules themselves have different recognition sites on their surface including charged amino acids and hydrophilic or hydrophobic regions, that can increase the chance of MIPs reduced selectivity and cross reactivity with any other protein molecules containing similar regions or charges [158].The challenges posed by proteins as targets exceed the normal challenges encountered with other hydrophilic templates.

        <p>Bulk polymerisation is considered the least popular choice for protein imprinting. This is attributed to the fact that proteins in solution have multiple conformational variations that can result in a very broad range of binding sites and non-selective binding. Moreover, the use of polar porogenic solvents favourable for proteins can reduce the strength of hydrogen bonds between the template and monomer resulting in reduced binding efficiency [143].Bulk polymerisation is considered the least popular choice for protein imprinting.

        <p>In order to solve the problems associated with protein imprinting, epitope approach has been introduced. In 2001, Rachkov and Minoura [159] introduced the epitope approach as a new way for protein imprinting. In this approach, a small peptide segment is driven from the big structure of the template protein (usually the C-terminal sequence) and used in the imprinting procedure. In this way, the produced MIPs will be able to recognize this sequence in the whole protein molecule with higher degree of selectivity and minimal non-specific binding. A sequence of no less than 9 amino acids is chosen from the C-terminal of a template protein. The reason for choosing the C-terminal is that it is less prone to post-translational modifications, which increases the chance of its recognition in sample by the developed MIPs. The epitope approach is an attractive alternative for imprinting of bulky protein templates (such as immunoglobulins) that provides the advantages of selectivity, high affinity and sensitivity. Moreover, this method is very cost effective, since it avoids the use of highly pure authentic proteins that might be very expensive. Nevertheless, finding the suitable epitope for protein imprinting is a complex procedure and requires knowledge of protein conformations to predict the exact structure of the produced peptide segment [160][161][162]. Another recent approach in epitope imprinting is the use of hidden or internal epitopes. This approach was introduced first by Bossi et al. in which the protein template is exposed to enzymatic digestion or heat denaturation to expose the hidden peptide sequences in its structure. Those epitopes are usually hidden inside the folded structure of the protein and less exposed to the surface interactions. Imprinting on the hidden epitopes increase the recognition of MIPs immensely since after denaturation these peptide sequences become exposed and specifically bind with MIPs without interference from steric hindrance. The choice of the peptide sequence is usually an in-silico procedure and requires careful study of the protein structure [163].In order to solve the problems associated with protein imprinting, epitope approach has been introduced.

        <p>As mentioned before, a metal coordination bond is an effective way for molecular imprinting in aqueous media since the metal coordination bond in much stronger than the hydrogen bond and less affected by water. Moreover, relying on the metal coordination bond ensures highly specific binding to the target protein and efficient binding in aqueous matrices as blood. However, the use of metal coordination is limited to protein targets that contain exposed histidine residues on the surface, which are capable of forming such bonds [157,164].As mentioned before, a metal coordination bond is an effective way for molecular imprinting in aqueous media since the metal coordination bond in much stronger than the hydrogen bond and less affected by water.

        <p>If a person looks closer, they will be able to find an uncanny resemblance between the structure of MIPs and natural enzymes. It was that similarity that led researchers to investigate the potential use of MIPs as catalysts in different chemical or biochemical reactions. Catalytic MIPs can be imprinted on template analogues of the transition state of a specific reaction. Consequently, when these MIPs are introduced into the reaction, they can selectively bind to the transition state and stabilize it, and therefore decrease the activation energy required for the reaction. Alternatively, MIPs can be designed to selectively bind to the reactants or the products to be able to steer the reaction forwards or backwards. Another approach is to develop MIPs as selective carriers for metal NPs required to catalyse any reaction and that in turn facilitates their easy removal after completion [176].Collectively, the recent advances and applications of MIPs in the field of catalysis are illustrated in the review by S.

        <p>MIPs come in handy as well in racemic separations using HPLC. Through tailoring and optimisation of MIPs synthesis, scientists could create MIPs that are capable of separating different enantiomers of the same compound and apply them for HPLC separations. Enantioselective separation of phenylalanine enantiomers was achieved using MIPs developed via bulk polymerisation for the separation of L-phenylalanine in its racemic mixture [179]. Another attempt for successful separation of racemic antihistaminic drugs using enantioselective MIPs beads was developed by suspension polymerisation method in aqueous media. Through the high selectivity of the developed MIPs, two antihistaminic drugs: d-chlorpheniramine and d-brompheniramine were separated from their racemates. This is particularly important in the field of medicine due to the drastic difference in medical efficacy between the two enantiomers of the same drug. More insights into the applications of MIPs in the field of chiral separations were introduced in some useful reviews [180,181]. The only precaution that we like to highlight regarding the application of MIPs in chromatography is the peak tailing that results from binding site heterogeneity. Therefore, care should be taken during synthesis and optimisation of MIPs intended for chromatographic use to avoid this problem.MIPs come in handy as well in racemic separations using HPLC.

        <p>A state-of-the-art technique for sensing that is increasingly applied nowadays is SPR. SPR is a type of optical sensor that depends on measuring the angle of reflection of a polarized light beam off an electrode surface separating two media. Usually, bioreceptors are immobilised on the other side of the electrode, which upon binding of the target analyte produces a change in the angle of reflection that can be directly correlated to the concentration of the analyte. Combining MIPs with a very sensitive technique such as SPR is very valuable in the field of analytical chemistry and microanalysis. A MIPs SPR biosensor was prepared for detection and quantification of iron regulating hormone hepcidin. The sensitivity of the biosensor reached a remarkable picomolar range, which is very useful in testing real samples [195]. Another SPR MIPs based sensor was developed for the analysis of amoxicillin antibiotic. The developed MIPs were coupled to two sensing techniques, SPR and QCM.

Although the SPR method showed a higher limit of quantitation, both methods were effectively applied to detect and quantify amoxicillin in real egg samples [196]. This cited review discusses further data on MIPs coupled to SPR and other optical techniques in the field of biosensing [197].</p>

Moreover, the most probable 32 orientation of PSA to pyrrole molecules showed the least adsorption energy (Gibbs energy) 33 and highest contact area, which was indicative of high stability and binding [299]. This 34 emphasize that computational techniques can save much time and effort in addition to 35 providing numerical proof of binding and stability. 41 combinatorial library of all possible MIPs compositions with different functional monomers and 42 cross linkers. A total of 96 MIPs were prepared by an automated auto-sampler and were 43 investigated for their affinity and selectivity. The best polymer composition involved the use 44 of DVB as a cross linker. However, the use of DVB led to a hydrophobic nature of the resulting 45 polymer and therefore, reduced its applications in aqueous media. In addition, the 46 hydrophobic nature increased the nonspecific binding with other amino acids sequences in 1 the protein 17 sensitivity to a level comparable to the expected serum levels of ProGRP. Further addition to 18 this method was performed in which of SPE conditions were carefully investigated using an 19 automated 384-well filter plate coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI)
