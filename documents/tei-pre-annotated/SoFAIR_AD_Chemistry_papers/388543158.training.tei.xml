        <p>Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer globally in men, and in some countries is now the most diagnosed form of cancer. It is necessary to differentiate between benign and malignant prostate conditions to give accurate diagnoses. We aim to demonstrate the use of a 3D Mueller matrix method to allow quick and easy clinical differentiation between prostate adenoma and carcinoma tissues with different grades and Gleason scores. Histological sections of benign and malignant prostate tumours, obtained by radical prostatectomy, were investigated. We map the degree of depolarisation in the different prostate tumour tissues using a Mueller matrix polarimeter set-up, based on the superposition of a reference laser beam with the interference pattern of the sample in the image plane. The depolarisation distributions can be directly related to the morphology of the biological tissues. The dependences of the magnitude of the 1st to 4th order statistical moments of the depolarisation distribution are determined, which characterise the distributions of the depolarisation values. To determine the diagnostic potential of the method three groups of histological sections of prostate tumour biopsies were formed. The first group contained 36 adenoma tissue samples, while the second contained 36 carcinoma tissue samples of a high grade (grade 4: poorly differentiated-4 + 4 Gleason score), and the third group contained 36 carcinoma tissue samples of a low grade (grade 1: moderately differentiated-3 + 3 Gleason score). Using the calculated values of the statistical moments, tumour tissues are categorised as either adenoma or carcinoma. A high level (&gt; 90%) accuracy of differentiation between adenoma and carcinoma samples was achieved for each group. Differentiation between the high-grade and low-grade carcinoma samples was achieved with an accuracy of 87.5%. The results demonstrate that Mueller matrix mapping of the depolarisation distribution of prostate tumour tissues can accurately differentiate between adenoma and carcinoma, and between different grades of carcinoma. This represents a first step towards the implementation of 3D Mueller matrix mapping for clinical analysis and diagnosis of prostate tumours.Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer globally in men, and in some countries is now the most diagnosed form of cancer.

Therefore, the effectiveness of differential 2D diagnostics is extremely low or unsatisfactory in this limit. The 2D polarisation diagnostics of frozen prostate tissue samples is limited by the impossibility of obtaining optically thin ( h ∼ 10-15 µm ) histological sections with geometric consistency between samples. To obtain consistent samples, a geometric thickness h ∼ 40 µm was required.

        <p>Figure 3 shows the phase dependences of the integral magnitude (averaged over all the pixels of the CCD-camera) of the degree of depolarisation �(θ k ) of laser radiation passing through prostate tissues from each of the three groups defined previously. The degree of depolarisation was experimentally determined using the 3D Mueller matrix mapping method described above. Analysis of the data obtained (see Fig. 3) revealed that, despite the overall depolarisation through the whole samples being more or less the same (Table 1), there are significant differences observed within the volume of the tissue samples. The overall ranges of �(θ k ) by histological biopsy sections of all samples span (15%-19%)for(θ k = 0.25 rad) ≤ � ≤ (78%-81%)for(θ k = 1.5 rad) . The rate at which the dependencies �(θ k ) change is very different though. The most rapidly increasing depolarising ability is seen for samples of histological sections of adenoma biopsy (see Fig. 3, dark curve), while the least rapid is for samples of native sections of grade 4 carcinoma (see Fig. 3, red curve), with grade 1 carcinoma (see Fig. 3, blue line).Figure 3 shows the phase dependences of the integral magnitude (averaged over all the pixels of the CCD-camera) of the degree of depolarisation �(θ k ) of laser radiation passing through prostate tissues from each of the three groups defined previously.

        <p>For small values of the phase ( θ k ≤ 0.5 rad ), the dominant contribution to the depolarisation formation scenario is the "A-mechanism". In general, soft biological tissues (including the prostate) have a relatively low level of optical anisotropy. The magnitude of the circular and linear birefringence n does not exceed 1.5 × 10 -3 5-8 . Therefore, for small values of the phase, the integral depolarisation is low for histological sections of all types of prostate tumours. With increasing θ k , the contribution of the "B-mechanism" the depolarising ability of the prostate samples increases. The contribution of the "B-mechanism" characterizes the measure of diffraction expansion of partial waves on optical inhomogeneities of biological tissue. The most pronounced effect of this mechanism manifests on small-scale (well differentiated) structures of the prostate tissue. Therefore, the most rapidly growing value of �(θ k ) is found for samples of histological sections of prostate adenoma (see Fig. 3, dark curve), the morphological structure of which is at the smallest scale. Conversely, the values of �(θ k ) for histologi- cal sections of biopsy of poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma increase most slowly (see Fig. 3, red curve).For small values of the phase ( θ k ≤ 0.5 rad ), the dominant contribution to the depolarisation formation scenario is the "A-mechanism".

        <p>For the largest values of phase shifts ( θ k ≥ 1.5 rad ), the diffraction "B-mechanism", which characterizes the multiple superposition of laser waves scattered in the volume of the biological layer, becomes dominant. The degree of depolarisation then reaches a maximum level for all types of samples. The maximum differences between the values of integral depolarisation by samples of histological sections of biopsy of prostate tumours are realized for a certain "intermediate" range of phase shifts ( 0.75 rad &lt; �θ * &lt; 1.05 rad ). The maximum dif- ference is found at θ * = 0.85 rad , so we choose this value for further investigations.For the largest values of phase shifts ( θ k ≥ 1.5 rad ), the diffraction "B-mechanism", which characterizes the multiple superposition of laser waves scattered in the volume of the biological layer, becomes dominant.

However, no obvious differences or relation to the tissue structure are immediately visible. For carcinoma with a higher (4 + 4) Gleason score, more obvious differences are visible.

        <p>We can then assess the depolarising ability of histological biopsy sections of benign and malignant prostate tumours within the framework of a statistical approach (15-18) to the analysis of the distributions � x, y, θ k . The largest mean and maximum range of coordinate fluctuations of the magnitude of the degree of depolarisation � x, y, θ k = 0.85 rad are found for histological sections of benign adenoma biopsies. The smallest mean and minimum range of coordinate fluctuations of the magnitude of the degree of depolarisation � x, y, θ k = 0.85 rad are found for histological sections of poorly differentiated carcinoma biopsies. The experimentally revealed differences in the series of maps x, y in the phase section θ * = 0.85 rad can be associated with the different degrees of differentiation of the structures within the prostate tumour tissues. For well differentiated adenoma tissue, diffraction effects are most pronounced. Therefore, the average value and fluctuations of the degree of depolarisation are maximal. For poorly differentiated (4 + 4) carcinoma tissue, the diffraction broadening of laser waves is smaller. Therefore, both the mean and variance of the individual coordinate values � x, y, θ k = 0.85 rad decrease.We can then assess the depolarising ability of histological biopsy sections of benign and malignant prostate tumours within the framework of a statistical approach (15-18) to the analysis of the distributions � x, y, θ k .
