Exactly how these species form remains an open question.</p>
        <p>Aims. This study aims to constrain the formation of complex organic molecules through comparisons of their abundances towards the Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422. Methods. We utilised observations from the ALMA Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of IRAS 16293-2422. The species identification and the rotational temperature and column density estimation were derived by fitting the extracted spectra towards IRAS 16293-2422 A and IRAS 16293-2422 B with synthetic spectra. The majority of the work in this paper pertains to the analysis of IRAS 16293-2422 A for a comparison with the results from the other binary component, which have already been published. Results. We detect 15 different complex species, as well as 16 isotopologues towards the most luminous companion protostar IRAS 16293-2422 A. Tentative detections of an additional 11 isotopologues are reported. We also searched for and report on the first detections of methoxymethanol (CH 3 OCH 2 OH) and trans-ethyl methyl ether (t-C 2 H 5 OCH 3 ) towards IRAS 16293-2422 B and the follow-up detection of deuterated isotopologues of acetaldehyde (CH 2 DCHO and CH 3 CDO). Twenty-four lines of doubly-deuterated methanol (CHD 2 OH) are also identified. Conclusions. The comparison between the two protostars of the binary system shows significant differences in abundance for some of the species, which are partially correlated to their spatial distribution. The spatial distribution is consistent with the sublimation temperature of the species; those with higher expected sublimation temperatures are located in the most compact region of the hot corino towards IRAS 16293-2422 A. This spatial differentiation is not resolved in IRAS 16293-2422 B and will require observations at a higher angular resolution. In parallel, the list of identified CHD 2 OH lines shows the need of accurate spectroscopic data including their line strength.Aims.

        <p>Complex organic molecules (COMs, i.e. molecules containing six or more atoms with at least one carbon atom; Herbst &amp; van Dishoeck 2009) are observed in various interstellar environments, ranging from very cold, dense collapsing cloud cores (e.g. Bacmann et al. 2012;Taquet et al. 2017) to protoplanetary discs (e.g. Öberg et al. 2015;Walsh et al. 2016;Favre et al. 2018), as well as in low-and high-mass star-forming regions (e.g. Blake et al. 1987;Fayolle et al. 2015;Bergner et al. 2017;Ceccarelli et al. 2017;Ospina-Zamudio et al. 2018;Bøgelund et al. 2019). Meteorite measurements (Ehrenfreund et al. 2001;Botta &amp; Bada 2002), comet coma observations (Bockelée-Morvan et al. 2000;Crovisier et al. 2004;Biver et al. 2014), and in situ Rosetta mission measurements (Le Roy et al. 2015;Altwegg et al. 2017) have revealed complex organic molecules, such as glycolaldehyde (CH 2 OHCHO), ethylene glycol ((CH 2 OH) 2 ), and glycine. The presence of complex and even pre-biotic species suggests that some of these molecules that formed during the earliest stage of stellar formation are preserved until the formation of small bodies. The extent to which the most complex species were formed at the earliest evolutionary stage of the protosolar nebula and how they were preserved or transformed during the formation of planetesimals remain open and complex questions.Complex organic molecules (COMs, i.e. molecules containing six or more atoms with at least one carbon atom; Herbst &amp; van Dishoeck 2009) are observed in various interstellar environments, ranging from very cold, dense collapsing cloud cores (e.g. Bacmann et al. 2012;Taquet et al. 2017) to protoplanetary discs (e.g. Öberg et al. 2015;Walsh et al. 2016;Favre et al. 2018), as well as in low-and high-mass star-forming regions (e.g. Blake et al. 1987;Fayolle et al. 2015;Bergner et al. 2017;Ceccarelli et al. 2017;Ospina-Zamudio et al. 2018;Bøgelund et al. 2019).

        <p>In this study, we focus on the formation of COMs during the deeply embedded Class 0 stage. Class 0 protostars are characterised by an envelope that is rich in diverse molecules, where most of the mass of the system is gathered (Andre &amp; Montmerle 1994). COMs may be observed in the inner regions of the envelope, which is close to their host protostar, where the temperature exceeds the water ice desorption temperature of ∼100 K. These molecule-rich regions are called hot cores for high-mass protostars and hot corinos for low-mass counterparts. At sub-millimetre wavelengths, most of the lines originate Article published by EDP Sciences A48, page 1 of 30 A&amp;A 635, A48 (2020) from complex species. The measured COM abundances are typically between 10 -7 and 10 -11 with respect to H 2 (e.g. Herbst &amp; van Dishoeck 2009). In general, the formation of COMs is thought to occur on ice surfaces through a succession of different processes that are initiated by efficient hydrogenation of simple ice species, for example, CO, which leads to the efficient production of methanol (CH 3 OH; Garrod &amp; Herbst 2006;Garrod et al. 2008;Fuchs et al. 2009;Chuang et al. 2018). During the collapse of the pre-stellar core, the temperature starts to increase during the so-called warm-up phase, and more complex species form and desorb into the gas phase in the hot corino.In this study, we focus on the formation of COMs during the deeply embedded Class 0 stage.

        <p>The resulting abundances of these species in the gas depend on the initial abundances of the precursors in the parent cloud, but they are also very sensitive to the physical conditions of the prestellar and protostellar phases and may thus vary significantly for different protostellar sources (Garrod 2013;Drozdovskaya et al. 2016). While the gas-phase formation pathways were not efficient enough to explain such high abundances of the COMs observed in the dense warm envelope, the recent progress in quantum chemical modelling brought attention back to the gasphase chemistry (e.g. Balucani et al. 2015;Skouteris et al. 2018Skouteris et al. , 2019)). Similar progress has been made recently in the study of the deuteration of COMs through gas-phase reactions (Skouteris et al. 2017). Careful comparisons between observations and predictions from grain surface and gas-phase reaction experiments and calculations are needed to address the relative importance for the species that are present in their different protostellar environments.The resulting abundances of these species in the gas depend on the initial abundances of the precursors in the parent cloud, but they are also very sensitive to the physical conditions of the prestellar and protostellar phases and may thus vary significantly for different protostellar sources (Garrod 2013;Drozdovskaya et al. 2016).

        <p>Close protostellar multiple sources, that is, systems with multiple components separated by 1000 au, are particularly interesting laboratories for studying the effect of the physical conditions with time. Indeed, the chemical evolution of such sources is expected to stem from the same initial compositions and physical conditions (gas and dust temperatures as well as ultra-violet irradiation), which are inherited from the common parental cloud. The Class 0 low-mass protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 (IRAS 16293 hereafter), which is located in the ρ Ophiuchus cloud complex at a distance of ∼140 pc (Dzib et al. 2018), is one of the best sources to investigate for that purpose. The components of the protostellar binary are known to be rich in COMs with abundances that are comparable to those seen towards high-mass protostars (van Dishoeck et al. 1995;Cazaux et al. 2003;Caux et al. 2011). Previous interferometric observations revealed abundance differences of specific molecules between the two protostars (Bisschop et al. 2008;Jørgensen et al. 2011Jørgensen et al. , 2012)); however, the origin of the differentiation is still debated. The Atacama Large Millimetre/ submillimetre Array (ALMA) Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey1 (PILS, Jørgensen et al. 2016) performed an unbiased spectral survey of the system in Band 7, demonstrating the strength of ALMA for detecting new complex species towards the most compact component IRAS 16293 B of the system, including CH 3 Cl (Fayolle et al. 2017), CH 3 NC (Calcutt et al. 2018a), HONO (Coutens et al. 2019), NH 2 CN (Coutens et al. 2018), and CH 3 NCO (Ligterink et al. 2017). In addition, many deuterated and less abundant isotopologues have been found for the first time in the interstellar medium (ISM) towards this source, including NHDCHO, NH 2 CDO (Coutens et al. 2016), NHDCN (Coutens et al. 2018), CHD 2 CN (Calcutt et al. 2018b), deuterated and 13 C isotopologues of CH 2 OHCHO, deuterated ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH), ketene (CH 2 CO), acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO) and formic acid (HCOOH; Jørgensen et al. 2016Jørgensen et al. , 2018)), OC 33 S (Drozdovskaya et al. 2018), and doubly deuterated methyl formate (CHD 2 OCHO; Manigand et al. 2019). This paper aims to study the O-bearing COMs in the other protostar IRAS 16293 A of the binary system and to compare their abundances with IRAS 16293 B. Because of the proximity of the two sources (5 ; ∼720 au), the two sources are expected to have the same molecular heritage as their parent cloud. Therefore, any abundance difference between the sources could reveal the chemistry that occurred during the earliest evolutionary phases of this low-mass protostellar binary.Close protostellar multiple sources, that is, systems with multiple components separated by 1000 au, are particularly interesting laboratories for studying the effect of the physical conditions with time.

        <p>Similar comparative studies have been carried out towards the Class 0 binary protostar NGC 1333 IRAS 4A. López-Sepulcre et al. (2017) observed this source at high angular resolution with ALMA and measured the abundances of eight COMs towards the two components of the binary. The authors notice a large difference in abundance for all the species and suggest that the lack of COMs towards one of the source could be due to a lower mass, with a lower accretion rate, compared to the molecule rich counterpart. This scenario could alternatively suggest that the COM-poor source is not yet in the collapse phase resulting in the formation of the hot corino, which is consistent with the lack of evidence for the presence of a hot corino in this component (Persson et al. 2012). In contrast, both components in IRAS 16293 are known to harbour hot corinos.Similar comparative studies have been carried out towards the Class 0 binary protostar NGC 1333 IRAS 4A.

        <p>We used ALMA data from the PILS survey of the low-mass protostellar binary IRAS 16293 (Jørgensen et al. 2016). The data are a combination of the 12 m dishes and the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). The observations cover the frequency range of 329.1-362.9 GHz with a spectral resolution of 0.244 MHz, corresponding to ∼0.2 km s -1 , and a restoring beam of 0. 5. The survey reaches a sensitivity of 4-5 mJy beam -1 km s -1 across the entire frequency range. The ALMA software suite 
            <rs type="software">CASA</rs> (McMullin et al. 2007) was used to reduce the data, except for the continuum subtraction, which was performed after the data reduction (for more details, see Jørgensen et al. 2016). The flux calibration across the spectral range is consistent with the 5% level. The spectroscopic data of all the species that are analysed in this paper are detailed in Appendix C as well as the vibrational correction factors used, in the case of rotational temperatures that are higher than 100 K.

        <p>The continuum peak positions, the strong continuum emission, the dynamics of the gas, and the spectral line density make it difficult to analyse the molecular emission. Therefore, the spectra were extracted towards offset positions at 0. 6 from the continuum peak position in the north-east direction and 0. 5 in the south-west direction for IRAS 16293 A and B, respectively. This is in agreement with the choice of the extracted spectrum position in the previous PILS studies (e.g. Calcutt et al. 2018b;Jørgensen et al. 2018;Lykke et al. 2017). Figure 1 shows the spectra towards IRAS 16293 A and B. Most of the lines identified towards IRAS 16293 B also appear in IRAS 16293 A, albeit at different intensities, which indicates that IRAS 16293 A is as rich in molecules as its companion. The line widths are typically two to three times larger towards IRAS 16293 A than towards IRAS 16293 B, thereby increasing the confusion due to blending effects. The complexity of the molecular emission towards IRAS16293 A and B makes the line assignment to the species difficult when based on the peak frequency alone. In some cases, a species that was not considered to be present in the source might have a significant number of transitions with frequencies coinciding with bright transitions of other species. In order to deal with such line confusion, we coupled the identification of possible O-bearing COMs present in the gas to the LTE analysis. All the species detected in the counterpart protostar IRAS16293 B and their fainter isotopologues were considered as potential candidate species that compose the envelope of IRAS16293 A. Additionally, related and more complex O-bearing COMs have also been added to the list of candidates, such as trans-ethyl methyl ether (t-C 2 H 5 OCH 3 ) and methoxymethanol (CH 3 OCH 2 OH).The continuum peak positions, the strong continuum emission, the dynamics of the gas, and the spectral line density make it difficult to analyse the molecular emission.

        <p>We compared the extracted spectrum with a synthetic model in order to identify and derive the abundances of species that are present in the gas. The model applies the radiative transfer equations to a homogeneous column of gas along the line of sight under the LTE assumption. Only the optically thin lines, which have a line opacity lower than 0.1, are considered in the comparison of the modelled spectrum. For each species, a single excitation temperature was assumed to describe the level populations, which we refer to as rotational temperature.We compared the extracted spectrum with a synthetic model in order to identify and derive the abundances of species that are present in the gas.

        <p>The uncertainties are usually given by the covariance matrix, which is estimated in the standard χ 2 minimisation methods. However, the modified χ 2 used in this study no longer allows for the use of the covariance matrix to get the uncertainties. Instead, the uncertainties have been estimated using a simple Monte Carlo simulation, where the spectrum as well as an additional Gaussian noise of σ b (v) amplitude were fitted to the synthetic spectrum several times. This gives a distribution of each parameter; here, the excitation temperature and the column density are called the posterior probability distributions. This versatile method has also been successfully used to estimate the uncertainties on the 3 µm OH band model parameters as well as in reflectance spectroscopy of meteorites and asteroids (Potin et al. 2019). In summary, the posterior probability distribution of the parameters represents the distribution of the possible values that can take each parameter, given the uncertainties of the data.

        <p>This statistical estimation of the uncertainties gives much lower relative errors on the excitation temperature and column density compared to the actual data relative uncertainties. This suggests that the proper statistical estimate of the errors is not conservative considering the underlying hypotheses of the LTE model and how they are handled in the minimisation. Indeed, the χ 2 minimisation assumes that the model is perfect and determines the best set of parameters to fit the observations. However, the observations include many effects that are neglected by the LTE analysis but which appear in the spectrum. These effects can be, for example, non-uniform source coverage, beam dilution, self-absorption effects, or abundance gradients of the species in the line of sight (with the associated velocity shift). Therefore, we chose to take conservative values of ∼20 and ∼30% for the rotational temperatures and the column densities relative uncertainties, respectively, for IRAS 16293 A. For consistency, the relative uncertainty values used in the study of Jørgensen et al. (2018) are assumed for IRAS 16293 B, that is, ∼20 and ∼10% for the rotational temperatures and the column densities, respectively.This statistical estimation of the uncertainties gives much lower relative errors on the excitation temperature and column density compared to the actual data relative uncertainties.

        <p>The relative abundances of the oxygen species are determined from their column density relative to the column density of CH 3 OH. We note that H 2 was not used as a reference for A48, page 4 of 30 the estimation of the abundances because only the lower limit of H 2 column density can be determined from the optically thick dust emission. Calcutt et al. (2018b) and Jørgensen et al. (2016) estimated the lower limit of H 2 column density towards IRAS 16293 A and B, respectively. The D/H ratio is based on the column density ratio and is corrected from the statistics of H atoms in the deuterated chemical group of the molecule. For example, the column density ratio of CH 2 DOH is three times higher than its D/H ratio. In addition, the statistical correction includes the symmetries in the sense of the rotational spectroscopy. For example, the asymmetric deuterated dimethyl ether (a-CH 2 DOCH 3 ) has four possible sites where the D atom could be placed, that is, out of the C-O-C plane, regardless of the rotational emission of the molecule. Thus, its column density ratio is four times higher than the D/H ratio. Similarly, the symmetric s-CH 2 DOCH 3 conformer has two in-plane possible sites for the D atom, which leads to a factor of two between the column density ratio and the D/H ratio. The rotational temperature of the isotopologues was fixed to the value derived for their main isotopologue, except for formaldehyde (H 2 CO) where only the H 13 2 CO rotational temperature could be constrained. For several isotopologues, the fit converged to a different rotational temperature as the main isotopologue. The difference is lower than the uncertainty for the rotational temperature and does not significantly affect the column density. The results of the minimisation for these species are indicated in the notes of Table 1. Despite the large frequency range of the survey, H 2 CO isotopologues only have a few lines in the range, and most of them are either optically thick or the transition levels are not populated at all (E up &gt; 1000 K). The rotational temperature was derived using two optically thin lines of H 13 2 CO, with upper state energies of 98 and 240 K. The optically thin lines, which were used to derive the column density of the other isotopologue, are the same lines used by Persson et al. (2018) in the analysis of IRAS 16293 B.The relative abundances of the oxygen species are determined from their column density relative to the column density of CH 3 OH.

        <p>Similar to the study of IRAS 16293 B (Jørgensen et al. 2018), a large number of rarer isotopologues were also identified towards IRAS 16293 A. We note that CH 18 3 OH and H 2 C 18 O show a 16 O/ 18 O ratio close to the local interstellar medium value of 557 ± 30 (Wilson 1999). The upper limit column density of H 2 C 17 O is consistent with the canonical 16 O/ 17 O ratio of 2005 ± 155 (Penzias 1981;Wilson 1999). The 13 C-isotopologues that were detected do not show any significant deviation from the local ISM 12 C/ 13 C ratio of 68 ± 15 (Milam et al. 2005). Lower 12 C/ 13 C ratios have been reported towards IRAS 16293 B (Jørgensen et al. 2018) and were interpreted by a chemical process that is similar to the deuteration enhancement on the ice grain surface, which occurs during the pre-stellar formation stage. However, the mean 12 C/ 13 C ratio of 76 ± 12 towards IRAS 16293 A is consistent with the local ISM value, which indicates that the isotopic enhancement mechanism observed in IRAS 16293 B does not occur in IRAS 16293 A. Deuterated isotopologues of CH 3 OH, H 2 CO, C 2 H 5 OH, dimethyl ether (CH 3 OCH 3 ), CH 3 OCHO, CH 2 CO, HCOOH, and isocyanic acid (HNCO) are present in the gas with D/H ratios of 2-5%. As it was observed towards IRAS 16293 B (Persson et al. 2018;Manigand et al. 2019), the doubly-deuterated isotopologues D 2 CO and CHD 2 OCHO are significantly enhanced compared to the singly-deuterated isotopologues.

        <p>Figure 2 shows the abundances of the main isotopologues with respect to CH 3 OH towards IRAS 16293 A and B. The column densities, from which the abundances were derived, were determined by using the spectrum extracted from the offset positions, as described in the previous section for IRAS 16293 A, which were used in previous studies of IRAS 16293 B (Coutens et al. 2016;Lykke et al. 2017;Jørgensen et al. 2016). Towards IRAS 16293 A, the abundances relative to CH 3 OH of CH 3 OCHO, ethylene oxide (c-C 2 H 4 O), CH 3 OCH 3 , CH 3 COCH 3 , acetic acid (CH 3 COOH), and HNCO are similar to the abundance observed towards IRAS 16293 B. On the other hand, the abundances of CH 2 CO, H 2 CO, CH 3 CHO C 2 H 5 OH, CH 2 (OH)CHO, (CH 2 OH) 2 , t-HCOOH, and formamide (NH 2 CHO) are significantly lower towards IRAS 16293 A than those towards IRAS 16293 B. This selective differentiation could reflect the differentiation of the species across the two protostars. However, it is not possible to rule out the effects of the CH 3 OH abundance with respect to H 2 , for which the column density cannot be properly estimated. In addition, considering a single species as a reference for the abundance of all the species can interfere with the relation between the abundance of several species. For example, in the case of IRAS 16293 and the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Drozdovskaya et al. (2019) show that it is more consistent to discuss the abundance of N-bearing and S-bearing species with respect to CH 3 CN and CH 3 SH, respectively.Figure 2 shows the abundances of the main isotopologues with respect to CH 3 OH towards IRAS 16293 A and B.

        <p>In order to complete the picture, we estimated the statistical distance S of abundance ratios of each pair of species between IRAS 16293 A and B, as detailed in Appendix A. Figure 3 shows the colour map of this cross-comparison; each cell corresponds to the statistical distance of the abundance ratio of two species towards IRAS 16293 A as compared to IRAS 16293 B. The advantage of this comparative analysis is that the abundances do not rely on a single species. This technique offers a global view of the comparison in terms of molecular abundance between the offset position from the two sources. The first and the tenth rows of the map are shown in the right panels of the figure and correspond to the comparison of abundances relative to CH 3 OH and A48, page 7 of 30 A&amp;A 635, A48 (2020) 3). The remaining species are in an intermediate category (Category II in Fig. 3) and are characterised by a lower abundance with respect to the first category species and a higher abundance with respect to the most depleted species for IRAS 16293 A in comparison to IRAS 16293 B.

        <p>The spatial distribution of the emission towards IRAS 16293 A and B can be very different depending on the species. The deconvolved source size of the IRAS 16293 B continuum emission is estimated to be 0. 5 (Jørgensen et al. 2016), which is similar to the beam size of the observations. Most of the detected species roughly follow the same distribution as the continuum and have the same source size. Concerning IRAS 16293 A, the continuum emission, as well as the molecular line emission arising from the gas, is more extended in the NE-SW axis where a 6 km s -1 velocity gradient was reported (Pineda et al. 2012;Favre et al. 2014;Jørgensen et al. 2016;Oya et al. 2016). Small variations in the spatial distribution of different species towards IRAS 16293 A can be marginally resolved with the beam of PILS observations. However, the velocity gradient, which is associated with the very high line density that is present in the spectrum, makes it very difficult to integrate a single line across the source without contamination from nearby lines of other species. Calcutt et al. (2018b) developed a new method to map the emission, called the velocity integrated emission map (VINE map), which takes into account the velocity shift of the emitting gas when integrating over the molecular emission. At each pixel, the integration range is then shifted to the peak velocity of the line to be mapped. When there is no large velocity variation across the map, which is the case for IRAS 16293 B for instance, the VINE map is equivalent to the standard integrated emission map (moment zero map). For IRAS 16293 A, the velocity shift correction at each pixel of the VINE maps is based on A48, page 8 of 30 the same bright transition 7 3,5 -6 4,4 of CH 3 OH at 337.519 GHz as used by Calcutt et al. (2018b). This transition is particularly suited for tracing the hot corino while being well isolated from other lines. Figure 4 shows VINE maps of the main isotopologues, and few deuterated conformers were detected towards IRAS 16293 A. In this study, the VINE maps were only used to check whether the emission distribution reaches the offset position, where we analysed the spectrum, as indicated by the white cross.The spatial distribution of the emission towards IRAS 16293 A and B can be very different depending on the species.

        <p>The emission of the species that have similar abundances towards IRAS 16293 A and B is distributed along the velocity gradient direction and cover the offset position, whereas A48, page 9 of 30 A&amp;A 635, A48 (2020) the emission distribution of the depleted species towards IRAS 16293 A in comparison to IRAS 16293 B is located around the continuum peak position of the respective sources and does not show the elliptical distribution of the continuum emission towards IRAS 16293 A. Only the CH 3 COOH emission distribution is as compact as the (CH 2 OH) 2 emission distribution, while the abundance towards IRAS 16293 A and B are similar. We checked the distribution emission towards IRAS 16293 B as well as for this species and noticed that the emission does not cover the offset position used in the previous studies. Therefore, CH 3 COOH seems depleted towards both IRAS 16293 A and B. This is why CH 3 COOH does not show a difference between IRAS 16293 A and B since it belongs to the most compact region of the warm envelope.The emission of the species that have similar abundances towards IRAS 16293 A and B is distributed along the velocity gradient direction and cover the offset position, whereas A48, page 9 of 30 A&amp;A 635, A48 (2020) the emission distribution of the depleted species towards IRAS 16293 A in comparison to IRAS 16293 B is located around the continuum peak position of the respective sources and does not show the elliptical distribution of the continuum emission towards IRAS 16293 A.

        <p>Spatial differences between COMs were previously observed towards the Galactic Centre Sgr B2 region (Hollis et al. 2001) as well as towards high-mass protostars (for example, Calcutt et al. 2014). Hollis et al. (2001) observed the emission of CH 3 OCHO and CH 2 (OH)CHO, among others, at two different angular resolutions. They detected the two species with an ∼60 beam size using the NRAO 12 m telescope, whereas the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) observations with a beam of ∼5 only revealed CH 3 OCHO. They suggested that CH 2 (OH)CHO was much more extended compared to CH 3 OCHO and its emission was spatially filtered by the interferometric character of the observations. These findings are supported by the more recent study of Li et al. (2017) towards an extended region of the Galactic Centre in which the authors reported cold gas emission of CH 2 (OH)CHO ∼36 pc in width around Sgr B2(N). We note that, these two observations of the CH 2 (OH)CHO spatial extent are specific to the Galactic Centre, where non-thermal desorption processes put the CH 2 (OH)CHO in the gas phase at temperatures much lower than the thermal desorption temperature of this species. Xue et al. (2019) consistently observed the three isomers CH 3 COOH, CH 3 OCHO, and CH 2 (OH)CHO towards Sgr B2(N) using ALMA in Band 3 with an angular resolution of 1. 6, which is sufficient to resolve the sources. The spatial distribution of the species reveals that CH 3 OCHO is more extended than both CH 2 (OH)CHO and CH 3 COOH, which is in agreement with the present study. Xue et al. (2019) suggest that the different formation pathways of the tree species through ice surfaces and gas-phase chemistry could explain the spatial differentiation. This interpretation was supported by the correlation with the distribution of the respective precursors especially for gasphase formation, such as CH 3 OCH 3 , which is the precursor of CH 3 OCHO (Balucani et al. 2015), and C 2 H 5 OH the precursor of CH 2 (OH)CHO and CH 3 COOH (Skouteris et al. 2018). The search for precursors through ice surfaces formation pathway is limited by the current infra-red absorption observations. Alternatively, the authors suggest that the effective desorption temperature of the species could explain their spatial distribution difference based on temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments of C 2 H 4 O 2 isomers (Burke et al. 2015). During the TPD, CH 3 OCHO desorbed at ∼70 K whereas CH 2 (OH)CHO and CH 3 COOH were released in the gas phase at ∼110 K. In the warm-up model of star formation, this would result in a more extended emission of CH 3 OCHO in comparison to the two other isomers. Calcutt et al. (2014) simultaneously detected CH 3 OCHO and CH 2 (OH)CHO, among other species, towards three high-mass sources, G31.41+0.31, G29.96-0.02, and G24.78+0.08A, which are located at 3.5, 7.1, and 7.7 kpc away, respectively. They find that CH 3 OCHO was more extended than CH 2 (OH)CHO towards G31 and that the two species had the same extent towards the two other sources. The spatial differentiation found in G31 could be similar to IRAS 16293; however, CH 2 (OH)CHO and the other depleted species towards IRAS 16293 A could also trace a deeper region in the envelope due to the excitation conditions. For example, CH 3 OCHO lines are optically thicker than those of CH 2 (OH)CHO and show a more extended spatial distribution.Spatial differences between COMs were previously observed towards the Galactic Centre Sgr B2 region (Hollis et al. 2001) as well as towards high-mass protostars (for example, Calcutt et al. 2014).

        <p>Also, such a spatial differentiation can be inferred indirectly. The first detection of glycolaldehyde by Jørgensen et al. (2012) was performed with ALMA at ∼2 angular resolution: This is enough to separate the two components of the binary system but larger than the source size of both components. Jørgensen et al. (2012) find a relative abundance CH 3 OCHO/CH 2 (OH)CHO of 10-15 for both protostars on these scales and did not see the same evidence for depletion of CH 2 (OH)CHO with respect to CH 3 OCHO for IRAS 16293 A in comparison to IRAS 16293 B, as discussed above. However, it is consistent with the interpretation that CH 2 (OH)CHO, as well as the other most depleted species towards the offset position from IRAS 16293 A, are located in a more compact region of the hot corino. This is also supported by observations of other COMs, such as CH 3 OCH 3 , D 2 CO (Jørgensen et al. 2011) and C 2 H 5 OH (Bisschop et al. 2008).Also, such a spatial differentiation can be inferred indirectly.

        <p>The distribution of COMs towards IRAS 16293 A suggests that a significant part of the emission is missing at the extracted spectrum position. However, the estimation of the rotational temperature is sensitive to the intensity variation of one line with respect to another line with a different upper energy level. Thus, the derivation of the rotational temperature is not affected by the apparent depletion due to the spatial extent and can be securely compared species-to-species.The distribution of COMs towards IRAS 16293 A suggests that a significant part of the emission is missing at the extracted spectrum position.

        <p>Towards IRAS 16293 A, the rotational temperatures of the detected species and their isotopologues are between 90 and 180 K, where HNCO, H 2 CO, CH 2 (OH)CHO, (CH 2 OH) 2 , NH 2 CHO, CH 3 CHO, and C 2 H 5 OH are the hottest species. Although the distinction between those hot species and the other species is not pronounced, the hot species seem to be located closer to the protostars compared to the other species, showing a lower rotational temperature.Towards IRAS 16293 A, the rotational temperatures of the detected species and their isotopologues are between 90 and 180 K, where HNCO, H 2 CO, CH 2 (OH)CHO, (CH 2 OH) 2 , NH 2 CHO, CH 3 CHO, and C 2 H 5 OH are the hottest species.

        <p>Using the PILS observations towards IRAS 16293 B, Jørgensen et al. (2018) detected the same species as those presented in this study and derived their rotational temperature. The authors find that the species located in the hot corino could be distinguished into two groups depending on their rotational temperature. Species such as CH 3 OH, C 2 H 5 OH, CH 3 OCHO, NH 2 CHO, HNCO, CH 2 (OH)CHO, and (CH 2 OH) 2 were observed with an rotational temperature of 250-300 K, whereas CH 2 CO, CH 3 CHO, CH 3 OCH 3 , H 2 CO, and c-H 2 COCH 2 were found at 100-150 K. Using these results and the previous results of PILS observations towards IRAS 16293 B from Coutens et al. (2016), Jørgensen et al. (2016), and Persson et al. (2018), Jørgensen et al. (2018) find a correlation between the rotational temperature and the desorption temperature of the oxygen-bearing COMs that are thought to mainly form on ice surfaces. This implies that the species that have a high rotational temperature (250-300 K) are more predominantly located in the hot and compact region of the hot corino, while the lower rotational temperature species belong to a more extended region inside the hot corino (see Fig. 4 of Jørgensen et al. 2018). By comparing this scenario to the difference in the spatial extent observed in IRAS 16293 A, the compact A48, page 10 of 30 species, such as CH 2 (OH)CHO, (CH 2 OH) 2 , NH 2 CHO, HNCO, and C 2 H 5 OH, are associated with high rotational temperature, whereas extended species, such as c-H 2 COCH 2 , CH 3 OCH 3 , and CH 3 COCH 3 , have a low rotational temperature. The ordering of the species across the onion-like structure of the envelope is in agreement with the desorption temperatures observed in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments of pure and mixed ices (Öberg et al. 2009;Fedoseev et al. 2015aFedoseev et al. ,b, 2017;;Paardekooper et al. 2016;Chuang et al. 2016;Qasim et al. 2019a,b).Using the PILS observations towards IRAS 16293 B, Jørgensen et al.

(2018) find a correlation between the rotational temperature and the desorption temperature of the oxygen-bearing COMs that are thought to mainly form on ice surfaces. This implies that the species that have a high rotational temperature (250-300 K) are more predominantly located in the hot and compact region of the hot corino, while the lower rotational temperature species belong to a more extended region inside the hot corino (see Fig. 4 of Jørgensen et al. 2018). By comparing this scenario to the difference in the spatial extent observed in IRAS 16293 A, the compact A48, page 10 of 30 species, such as CH 2 (OH)CHO, (CH 2 OH) 2 , NH 2 CHO, HNCO, and C 2 H 5 OH, are associated with high rotational temperature, whereas extended species, such as c-H 2 COCH 2 , CH 3 OCH 3 , and CH 3 COCH 3 , have a low rotational temperature. The ordering of the species across the onion-like structure of the envelope is in agreement with the desorption temperatures observed in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments of pure and mixed ices (Öberg et al. 2009;Fedoseev et al. 2015aFedoseev et al. ,b, 2017;;Paardekooper et al. 2016;Chuang et al. 2016;Qasim et al. 2019a,b).</p>
        <p>In addition, the rotational temperature of CH 3 COOH towards IRAS 16293 B is consistent with its most compact location in the envelope of both sources. However, the correlation between the rotational temperature and the location does not work in IRAS 16293 A for CH 3 OH, CH 3 OCHO, CH 2 CO, H 2 CO, CH 3 CHO, and t-HCOOH.In addition, the rotational temperature of CH 3 COOH towards IRAS 16293 B is consistent with its most compact location in the envelope of both sources.

        <p>Concerning CH 3 OH and CH 3 OCHO, these two species were found to be hot species in IRAS 16293 B; however, they correspond to cold and extended species in IRAS 16293 A. Their optically thick lines suggest the presence of two components towards IRAS 16293 B that are indistinguishable due to the smaller source size with respect to the angular resolution: one is at a rotational temperature of 300 and another is at ∼125 K (Jørgensen et al. 2018). In addition, the rotational temperature derived towards IRAS 16293 A for the same two species is only consistent with the second component at 125 K, indicating that the bulk of the emission consists of the extended warm gas. From this, CH 3 OH and CH 3 OCHO are found to trace not only the central core but also the extended part of the hot corino.Concerning CH 3 OH and CH 3 OCHO, these two species were found to be hot species in IRAS 16293 B; however, they correspond to cold and extended species in IRAS 16293 A.

        <p>Regarding CH 2 CO isotopologues, there are only a few lines in the range of the observations and most of those are blended with small species, such as 33 SO at ∼343.08 GHz and CS at ∼342.88 GHz. The deuterated isotopologue CHDCO suggests that the low abundance towards IRAS 16293 A compared to IRAS 16293 B is due to the spatial extent differences between the two sources. The emission distribution of H 2 CO was found to be much more complex and extended across the binary protostars and it traces both the hot corino region and the outflow interface with the bridge structure between IRAS 16293 A and B and the E-W outflow emerging from IRAS 16293 A (van der Wiel et al. 2019).Regarding CH 2 CO isotopologues, there are only a few lines in the range of the observations and most of those are blended with small species, such as 33 SO at ∼343.08 GHz and CS at ∼342.88 GHz.

        <p>The few unblended, but optically thick, lines of CH 3 CHO show a large distribution towards both sources, suggesting that the bulk of the emission corresponds to the extended part of the hot corino, despite the abundance difference between sources A and B. The three-phase chemical model of Garrod (2013) shows that the abundance of CH 3 CHO in the gas phase increases during the evolution of the hot corino, which occurs even before the species desorbs from the ice grain surfaces. This suggests that gas-phase formation paths significantly contribute to the formation of CH 3 CHO at relatively low temperatures before the bulk of the species desorb from the ice. Concerning the abundance observed towards IRAS 16293 binary, if the gas-phase formation paths effectively produce CH 3 CHO in the outer part of the hot corino, it should increase the abundance of CH 3 CHO towards the most luminous source with respect to the other component. However, the luminosity of IRAS 16293 A was estimated to be ∼18 L , which is six times higher than IRAS 16293 B (Jacobsen et al. 2018).The few unblended, but optically thick, lines of CH 3 CHO show a large distribution towards both sources, suggesting that the bulk of the emission corresponds to the extended part of the hot corino, despite the abundance difference between sources A and B.

        <p>In summary, the analysis of the spatial extent, the abundances, and the rotational temperatures suggests that the hot corinos show a stratification of the COMs along the distance to the forming star. This spatial differentiation towards IRAS 16293 A could be linked to the rotational temperature of the species 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 D/H ratio observed towards IRAS 16293 B in the way that species at 300 K are more compact than the species at 125 K. Although this spatial differentiation is not resolved for IRAS 16293 B, the rotational temperature suggests its presence. Towards IRAS 16293 A, the difference in rotational temperature between compact and extended species is less pronounced, which could be due to the geometry of the source (inclination, size) or the presence of the nearly edge-on disc (Pineda et al. 2012;Favre et al. 2014;Girart et al. 2014).In summary, the analysis of the spatial extent, the abundances, and the rotational temperatures suggests that the hot corinos show a stratification of the COMs along the distance to the forming star.

        <p>The sensitivity of the ALMA observations makes the detection of many deuterated isotopologues of the oxygen-bearing species possible. Figure 5 compares the D/H ratios of these species derived from the estimated column densities found towards the offset position of IRAS 16293 A and reported in the previous studies of IRAS 16293 B (Coutens et al. 2016;Lykke et al. 2017;Persson et al. 2018;Jørgensen et al. 2018) on a linear scale. In general, the D/H ratios of IRAS 16293 A species are found to be as high as those of the species of IRAS 16293 B. However, due to the higher uncertainty in the column densities and the higher number of upper limits, it is difficult to observe a trend in the deuteration itself. Nevertheless, there is apparently no direct correlation between the D/H ratios and the stratification suggested by the rotational temperatures. This could suggest that contrary to the rotational temperatures and the spatial extents, which give a clue as to the structure of the hot corino and thus the warm chemistry in situ, the D/H ratio gives information about the history of the envelope during the pre-stellar phase A48, page 11 of 30 A&amp;A 635, A48 (2020) when the gas was cold enough to let the D/H ratio of the frozen species increase. This is supported by the D/H ratio of the doubly-deuterated isotopologues D 2 CO of 2.0 ± 0.4 × 10 -1 and CHD 2 OCHO of 8.2 ± 0.6 × 10 -2 (Manigand et al. 2019) found towards IRAS 16293 A.The sensitivity of the ALMA observations makes the detection of many deuterated isotopologues of the oxygen-bearing species possible.

        <p>Using the result reported in Table 2 and the column density of CH 3 CHO measured towards IRAS 16293 B (Lykke et al. 2017;Jørgensen et al. 2018), which is 1.2 × 10 17 cm -2 , the D/H ratio of CH 2 DCHO and CH 3 CDO are 1.4 and 4.7%, respectively. The upper limits of the D/H ratio of CH 2 DCHO and CH 3 CDO towards IRAS 16293 A are &lt;6 and &lt;17%, respectively. The D/H ratio of the groups CH 3 -and HCO-are significantly different for CH 3 CHO even after applying the statistical correction for both sources. Assuming that the main formation route is due to the addition of those two radicals on the ice surface during the warm-up phase, then the difference in deuteration may indicate that the deuteration enhancement is different for CH 3 and HCO, which are already in the prestellar phase when the temperature is low enough to favour the deuteration enhancement of H + 3 in the gas phase. However, the other species thought to be formed on ice surfaces do not show such a difference in the D/H ratio between CH 3 -or CH 2 -and HCO-groups, such as CH 3 OCHO and CH 2 (OH)CHO (Jørgensen et al. 2016). This suggests a selective process, independent of the luminosity difference between IRAS 16293 A and B, which increases the deuteration of HCOor decreases those of CH 3 -without significantly impacting the other species.Using the result reported in Table 2 and the column density of CH 3 CHO measured towards IRAS 16293 B (Lykke et al. 2017;Jørgensen et al. 2018), which is 1.2 × 10 17 cm -2 , the D/H ratio of CH 2 DCHO and CH 3 CDO are 1.4 and 4.7%, respectively.

        <p>1. The abundances with respect to CH 3 OH of half of the species are significantly lower towards the 0. 6 offset position from IRAS 16293 A in comparison to the 0. 5 offset position from IRAS 16293 B in spite of its higher luminosity. 2. The cross-correlation of the main isotopologue abundances highlights a selective differentiation depending on the species observed. Their abundances with respect to CH 3 OH are consistent with the previous detection of these species towards the high mass protostellar regions Sgr B2(N) and Orion KL. Upper limits of their column density are derived towards IRAS 16293 A. 6. The D/H ratio is not correlated to the structure of the hot corino itself; however, it is the result of what happens during the formation of COMs in the pre-stellar phase. The multiply-deuterated COMs seem to have a systematically higher D/H ratio compared to singly-deuterated species. More observations of different sources, supported by future spectroscopic studies of other multiply-deuterated COMs, are required to confirm this trend. In addition, we report the identification of 23 CHD 2 OH transitions at 0.8 mm wavelength, which have not been observed so far. The intensity of CHD 2 OH lines suggests a high abundance and D/H ratio, as it is for CHD 2 OCHO. The identification of these CHD 2 OH transitions highlights the need for spectroscopic data for CHD 2 OH and CD 3 OH to derive their rotational temperatures and their column densities and to get their D/H ratios. As discussed in this paper, abundance variations between IRAS 16293 A and B suggest that the spatial distributions are different for the species associated with low or high rotational temperatures. Whether the origins of these differences are physical or chemical, future higher angular observations will be critical in resolving the innermost structure of the two protostars.

The low vibration states are too energetically high to make the vibrational correction factor significant at 110 K.The rotational spectrum of CH 3 COOH was first extensively analysed by Ilyushin et al. (2008), which was based on a fair amount of measured spectroscopic data from 8 to 358 GHz taken from Tabor (1957), Krisher &amp; Saegebarth (1971), van Eijck et al.

        <p>The JPL catalogue provides the line list for CH 2 (OH)CHO. The entry is based on the rotational lines collection of Carroll et al. (2010). Previous laboratory measurements were carried out by Marstokk &amp; Møllendal (1970, 1973), and Butler et al. (2001) and served as the base for the latest study. The partition function was previously calculated by Widicus Weaver et al. (2005) over a measured frequency range from 72 to 122.5 GHz and included the ground state and three partially populated vibrational states at room temperature. Carroll et al. (2010) find a systematic bias in the lines with K a ∼ 28-31 and they corrected iteratively the assignment in the JPL line list.The JPL catalogue provides the line list for CH 2 (OH)CHO.

        <p>The identified lines of CHD 2 OH are given in this section, in Table D.1. The unblended lines alone were fitted using a Gaussian line profile and plotted in Figs. D.1 and D.2. 1 and2, for all the detected species. The most unblended and optically thin lines are shown, up to twenty lines for the species having more fitted transitions, such as CH 3 OCHO and CHThe identified lines of CHD 2 OH are given in this section, in Table D.1.
