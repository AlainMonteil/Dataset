        <p>Over the last decades, contamination has become a global concern and conventional petroleum-based plastics are an important issue with regards waste management. The food packaging industry is the main plastic demander as it accounts for about half of all used worldwide packaging (de Oliveira &amp; de Melo, 2019), generating high amounts of waste. Due to this problem, the packaging industry has promoted the development of new biodegradable, non-toxic and edible materials. New trends are focused on replacing conventional plastics by biodegradable polymers such as starch, cellulose, alginates and vegetal proteins (Cazón, Velázquez, Ramírez, &amp; Vázquez, 2017;González-Seligra, Eloy-Moura, Famá, Druzian, &amp; Goyanes, 2016;Mishra, Sabu, &amp; Tiwari, 2018;Ochoa-Yepes, Medina-Jaramillo, Guz, &amp; Famá, 2018). Biopolymers based on starch represent an attractive option owing to their low cost, availability and capability of forming thermoplastic films that easily degrade when exposed to specific environmental conditions and bacteria or fungal action (García, Famá, D'Accorso, &amp; Goyanes, 2015;Ghanbarzadeh, Almasi, &amp; Entezami, 2011;Raigond et al., 2019.). However, the biodegradable nature of starch-based materials for packaging was not enough to generate interest among consumers or the industry for commercialization. Therefore, the development of functional materials intended for packaging became attractive to satisfy the needs of modern society.Over the last decades, contamination has become a global concern and conventional petroleum-based plastics are an important issue with regards waste management.

        <p>Functional systems can be categorized into two general groups: active packaging, which actively and deliberately modify the product or the environment it contains during storage, transportation, and even usage to improve the safety and quality of food, and intelligent or smart packaging, which inform the consumer about the kinetic changes related to the quality of the food or the environment it contains, to minimize losses and ensure high quality and safety (Jafarizadeh-Malmiri, Sayyar, Anarjan, &amp; Berenjian, 2019). Intelligent packaging needs to be easy to interpret, quick, reliable, sensitive, safe, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and most importantly cheap, for the visual determination of pH changes, which have been successfully used to evaluate food quality status (Yam, Takhistov, &amp; Miltz, 2005;Yucel, 2016).Functional systems can be categorized into two general groups: active packaging, which actively and deliberately modify the product or the environment it contains during storage, transportation, and even usage to improve the safety and quality of food, and intelligent or smart packaging, which inform the consumer about the kinetic changes related to the quality of the food or the environment it contains, to minimize losses and ensure high quality and safety (Jafarizadeh-Malmiri, Sayyar, Anarjan, &amp; Berenjian, 2019).

        <p>In this context, starch-based films result attractive because they can be enriched by the addition of antioxidants, antimicrobials, nutrients and color change indicator components to produce active and intelligent packaging, increasing the shelf life of food (Gutiérrez, González-Seligra, Medina-Jaramillo, Famá, &amp; Goyanes, 2017;Hernández-Muñoz et al., 2019;Silvestre, Duraccio, &amp; Cimmino, 2011). Particularly, the use of antioxidants from natural resources is preferred to avoid synthetic additives, which are associated with negative effects on human health.In this context, starch-based films result attractive because they can be enriched by the addition of antioxidants, antimicrobials, nutrients and color change indicator components to produce active and intelligent packaging, increasing the shelf life of food (Gutiérrez, González-Seligra, Medina-Jaramillo, Famá, &amp; Goyanes, 2017;Hernández-Muñoz et al., 2019;Silvestre, Duraccio, &amp; Cimmino, 2011).

        <p>Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is a plant rich in polyphenols content, mainly flavonoids and xanthines (Heck &amp; De Mejia, 2007) which has antioxidant, antiinflammatory and anti-mutagenic properties (Bracesco, Sanchez, Contreras, Menini, &amp; Gugliucci, 2011). The relevant antioxidant and plasticizing effects of yerba mate extract on cassava starch biofilms have been already evaluated in samples obtained by casting (Knapp et al., 2019;Machado, Nunes, Pereira, &amp; Druzian, 2012;Medina-Jaramillo, González-Seligra, Goyanes, Bernal, &amp; Famá, 2015;Medina-Jaramillo, Gutiérrez, Goyanes, Bernal, &amp; Famá, 2016). Additionally, it has been evidenced that anthocyanins (which form part of flavonoids), change their color when exposed to mediums with different pH (Shahid, Islam, &amp; Mohammad, 2013;Veiga-Santos, Ditchfield, &amp; Tadini, 2011).Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is a plant rich in polyphenols content, mainly flavonoids and xanthines (Heck &amp; De Mejia, 2007) which has antioxidant, antiinflammatory and anti-mutagenic properties (Bracesco, Sanchez, Contreras, Menini, &amp; Gugliucci, 2011).

        <p>Nowadays, most research about biodegradable polymers based materials are focused on casting as manufacturing method (Carissimi, Flôres, &amp; Rech, 2018;Feng et al., 2018;Pessanha, Farias, Carvalho, &amp; Godoy, 2018). This is a laboratory scale methodology that implies economical equipment and limited space. However, it allows the production J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of small quantities in a long time process, resulting inconvenient for plastic companies, which search for industrial production (large-scale) and without having to invest in new equipment. Consequently, the need to produce with standard equipment used in the manufacture of synthetic polymers triggered the implementation of the extrusion technique to fabricate thermoplastic starch based materials (Guarás, Ludueña, &amp; Álvarez, 2017;Ochoa-Yepes et al., 2018;Pelissari, Yamashita, &amp; Grossmann, 2011).Nowadays, most research about biodegradable polymers based materials are focused on casting as manufacturing method (Carissimi, Flôres, &amp; Rech, 2018;Feng et al., 2018;Pessanha, Farias, Carvalho, &amp; Godoy, 2018).

        <p>Nevertheless, the extrusion of starch-based materials is much more complex than that of conventional plastics due to the existence of various transitions during processing such as gelatinization, melting, decomposition and recrystallization (Li et al., 2011). Hence, different chemical modifications of starch have been investigated leading to improvements in processability and a decrease in retrogradation of thermoplastic starchbased films (BeMiller, 2018;Dai, Zhang, &amp; Cheng, 2019;Ogunsona, Ojogbo, &amp; Mekonnen, 2018).Nevertheless, the extrusion of starch-based materials is much more complex than that of conventional plastics due to the existence of various transitions during processing such as gelatinization, melting, decomposition and recrystallization (Li et al., 2011).

        <p>A highly relevant chemical process used for the modification of starch, is acid hydrolysis. In a first rapid stage it erodes the amorphous regions of starch granules, breaking α-D-(1,4) glycosidic linkages then α-D-(1,6) glycosidic linkages, leading to a polysaccharide with lower molecular weight (Pratiwi, Faridah, &amp; Lioe, 2018). This facilitates the extrusion process, suggesting that hydrolyzed starch could be a feasible alternative to obtain homogeneous films using less process energy.A highly relevant chemical process used for the modification of starch, is acid hydrolysis.

        <p>There is limited research on the effect of acid hydrolysis of starch grains on the properties of thermoplastic films obtained by extrusion and so far, no results are reported in the literature relating the use of this technique together with natural antioxidants to produce active and smart packaging.There is limited research on the effect of acid hydrolysis of starch grains on the properties of thermoplastic films obtained by extrusion and so far, no results are reported in the literature relating the use of this technique together with natural antioxidants to produce active and smart packaging.</p>

        <p>It is noted that the intensity of the band around 3300 cm -1 resulted slightly higher in TPHS compared to TPNS. This peak is strongly related to available and not-available OH groups (Grace &amp; Liew, 2016) thus, the higher intensity may indicate the presence of more OH groups in the hydrolyzed starch matrix. This behavior is a consequence of the hydrolysis process that breaks the starch chains leading to a larger number of the extreme of chains with OH (González-Seligra et al., 2016).

        <p>The films prepared with native starch and yerba mate extract (TPNS-Y10 and TPNS-Y20) presented slightly higher intensity in the peak at  3300 cm -1 with respect to TPNS, that can be due to components present in yerba mate such as Chlorogenic acid, Saponins, Theobromine and Caffeine (Silverstein et al., 2014), and/or OH groups of the extract, which contribute to the amount of OH in those films. In the case of the materials prepared with hydrolyzed starch and yerba mate extract (TPHS-Y10 and TPHS-Y20), no significant differences with respect to TPHS were observed at this band. No significant changes were observed in the band at around 1638 cm -1 related to the stretching and bending vibration of hydrogen bonding O-H groups of the water prepared by casting. This is expectable taking into account that casting involves higher amount of water than extrusion. During extrusion, the interactions between starchglycerol and yerba mate extract were not enough to alter infrared spectra.

        <p>Moisture content of TPNS was in accordance with the values reported in the literature for starch films made by extrusion (Gutiérrez, Toro-Márquez, Merino, &amp; Mendieta, 2018;Ochoa-Yepes et al., 2019), while solubility resulted higher and WVP lower than those reported by other authors (González-Seligra et al., 2017). Considering that water vapor permeability of a film in the packaging industry is related to its capability to control the water vapor transmission (WVT) between a product and the environment, a lower value of WVP is advantageous as it implies a limitation on WVT, preserving the shelf life of the product. It is well known that permeability depends on the solubility and diffusivity of water in the polymeric matrix. A decrease in WVP value of TPNS with respect to those reported in the literature could be due to the interruption in the diffusion path created by the broken starch grains distributed in the polymeric matrix observed in SEM micrographs (Fig. 2a). The tortuous path formed is capable of reducing the diffusion rate of molecules through the film, leading to a decrease of water permeability (Slavutsky, Bertuzzi, Armada, García, &amp; Ochoa, 2014).Moisture content of TPNS was in accordance with the values reported in the literature for starch films made by extrusion (Gutiérrez, Toro-Márquez, Merino, &amp; Mendieta, 2018;Ochoa-Yepes et al., 2019), while solubility resulted higher and WVP lower than those reported by other authors (González-Seligra et al., 2017).

        <p>Hydrolyzed starch matrix exhibited increases in all the susceptibility to water values compared to those of TPNS. The increment in S is consistent to observations made by other authors who related this behavior with the hydrolysis process (Luchese, Frick, Patzer, Spada, &amp; Tessaro, 2015;Wang &amp; Copeland, 2015;Wang, Thruong, &amp; Wang, 2003). As reported in the literature, higher values of MC in TPHS could be due to the hydrolysis process, which breaks the starch chains, generating additional extremes of chains and therefore producing a more open packing and more free OH that facilitates the absorption of water (González-Seligra et al., 2016). The increase in WVP can be attributed to this fact and to the slightly lower number of broken grains in TPHS compared to TPNS detected in SEM micrographs. Furthermore, susceptibility to water behavior of TPHS is consistent to the lower value of the contact angle with respect to that of TPNS (Fig. 3), indicating that the chemical modification hydrophilized the modified films surface.Hydrolyzed starch matrix exhibited increases in all the susceptibility to water values compared to those of TPNS.

        <p>The incorporation of 10 wt.% yerba mate extract in native starch films (TPNS-Y10) led to an increasing trend of MC and S values but without significant differences. However, there was a slight decrease of WVP in near 15%. This could be attributed to the fact that although there are almost no broken grains in TPNS-Y10, which would lead to an increase in permeability, the great interaction between the extract and the starch suggested by SEM analysis, could have made water molecules move through a tortuous path when diffused across the polymer matrix (Slavutsky et al., 2014), leading to a decrease in WVP. In native starch films containing 20 wt.% (TPNS-Y20) no significant differences in MC and S values were detected but a slight increasing trend of the MC value was observed, while WVP value increased in almost 47%. SEM analysis for this material revealed a different morphology with respect to TPNS and TPNS-Y10 and similar to a highly plasticized starch-based material. According to the literature, an J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f increment in the content of the plasticizer in starch films leads to an increase in WVP (Chillo et al., 2008;Guo et al., 2012;Pushpadass et al., 2008). Therefore, yerba mate extract in the highest concentration incorporated into cassava native starch matrix could be acting as a plasticizer, as it was reported by Reis et al. (2015).The incorporation of 10 wt.% yerba mate extract in native starch films (TPNS-Y10) led to an increasing trend of MC and S values but without significant differences. However, there was a slight decrease of WVP in near 15%. This could be attributed to the fact that although there are almost no broken grains in TPNS-Y10, which would lead to an increase in permeability, the great interaction between the extract and the starch suggested by SEM analysis, could have made water molecules move through a tortuous path when diffused across the polymer matrix (Slavutsky et al., 2014), leading to a decrease in WVP. In native starch films containing 20 wt.% (TPNS-Y20) no significant differences in MC and S values were detected but a slight increasing trend of the MC value was observed, while WVP value increased in almost 47%.

        <p>For modified starch films, no significant differences were found in both MC and water solubility, while WVP slightly increased with the incorporation of yerba mate extract, as it resulted higher in almost 28% in TPHS-Y10 and 10% in TPHS-Y20.For modified starch films, no significant differences were found in both MC and water solubility, while WVP slightly increased with the incorporation of yerba mate extract, as it resulted higher in almost 28% in TPHS-Y10 and 10% in TPHS-Y20.</p>
        <p>Although the presence of broken grains in these materials may cause a tortuous path for the water molecules and therefore diminish WVP, the increment in the values of WVP could be explained by the plasticizing effect of the extract. As the same amount incorporated in other samples is now distributed in the region without grains, the concentration of extract is higher there and may act as plasticizer.Although the presence of broken grains in these materials may cause a tortuous path for the water molecules and therefore diminish WVP, the increment in the values of WVP could be explained by the plasticizing effect of the extract.

        <p>In order to evaluate the effect of both the starch modification and the extract incorporation in the hydrophilicity of the films, the contact angle (θ) between a drop of water and the surface of a film (angle of deposition) was measured (Fig. 3). It is well known that wettability is strongly influenced by the contact angle and it is greatly related to the hydrophobicity of the film (Abreu et al., 2015;Vogler, 1998). Higher θ indicates less hydrophilicity.In order to evaluate the effect of both the starch modification and the extract incorporation in the hydrophilicity of the films, the contact angle (θ) between a drop of water and the surface of a film (angle of deposition) was measured (Fig. 3).

        <p>Although the contact angle values for native starch film (60 ± 5º) and for modified starch sample (56 ± 4º) did not present significant differences, an increasing trend of the values for TPNS compared to those for TPHS was observed, indicating more hydrophobicity in the native starch film. This is consistent with susceptibility to water behavior, as it presented slightly lower values of MC and water solubility than TPHS.Although the contact angle values for native starch film (60 ± 5º) and for modified starch sample (56 ± 4º) did not present significant differences, an increasing trend of the values for TPNS compared to those for TPHS was observed, indicating more hydrophobicity in the native starch film.

        <p>For native starch films, the incorporation of 10 wt.% of yerba mate extract did not change significantly the contact angle with respect to TPNS, being 62 ± 4º, while the addition of 20 wt.% of the extract provoked a decrease in θ of almost 40%, indicating a more hydrophilic surface for TPNS-Y20. This behavior accords with the hypothesis that the extract can act as a plasticizer when incorporated in this concentration in the native starch matrix. In the case of films processed with hydrolyzed starch, the incorporation of both concentrations of yerba mate extract led to a decrease of the values of θ, indicating higher hydrophilicity with respect to TPHS, and being consistent with WVP values (Table 3). Particularly, the lowest value of θ corresponds to TPHS-Y20, probably due to the effect of the extract acting as plasticizer, being a consequence of the higher concentration in the zones without broken grains in the sample.For native starch films, the incorporation of 10 wt.% of yerba mate extract did not change significantly the contact angle with respect to TPNS, being 62 ± 4º, while the addition of 20 wt.% of the extract provoked a decrease in θ of almost 40%, indicating a more hydrophilic surface for TPNS-Y20.

        <p>Tensile parameters values for all systems investigated are presented in Table 4. Films obtained from native starch (TPNS) presented higher modulus and stress at break values but lower strain at break values than similarly prepared thermoplastic starch films reported in the literature (González-Seligra et al., 2017;Ochoa-Yepes et al., 2019). This behavior could be attributed to the presence of broken starch grains as it was observed in SEM micrographs (Fig. 2a). On the one hand, starch grains have a rigid structure and could act as reinforcement (Li et al., 2011), contributing to the material mechanical strength (Gutiérrez, Tapia, Pérez, &amp; Famá, 2015;Sun, Liu, Ji, Hou, &amp; Dong, 2017). On the other hand, the presence of grains could lead to a material with smaller strain at break as a result of premature failure.Tensile parameters values for all systems investigated are presented in Table 4.

        <p>Modified starch films showed a decrease in the E value and presented higher 𝜀 𝑏 value than TPNS, indicating more flexibility. TPHS have less broken grains than TPNS and also slightly more water content. Although the mechanical behavior could be affected by both factors, the difference in morphology has probably a higher effect than the change in humidity which is also very slight. Furthermore, strain at break in TPHS resulted higher because the probability of cracks is smaller as there are less broken grains. Tensile toughness for TPHS is higher than TPNS, due to the increase in the strain at break. Therefore, the use of the hydrolyzed starch led to a more flexible material with also higher tensile toughness.Modified starch films showed a decrease in the E value and presented higher 𝜀 𝑏 value than TPNS, indicating more flexibility.

        <p>The effect of the incorporation of yerba mate extract was different, depending on the amount introduced and the type of starch. For TPNS-Y10, both E and 𝜀 𝑏 presented a slight trend to increase compared to TPNS, as expectable considering the trends observed in WC and hydrophobicity behavior of those films, as well as the decrease in the number of broken starch grains and therefore in the probability of cracks.The effect of the incorporation of yerba mate extract was different, depending on the amount introduced and the type of starch.

        <p>J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f higher values of E could be attributed to a good interaction between the extract and starch. Since hydrolysis acidic modification led to a starch with a higher number of short chains, it can be expected that more interactions occur between the extract and modified starch than with the native starch. Strain at break for TPHS-Y10 and TPHS showed no significant differences, whereas b of TPHS-Y20 increased in nearly 15%, possibly due to the great interaction between the extract and matrix components and the effect of the yerba mate extract, already by other authors, which led to improvements in flexibility (Knapp et al., 2019).

        <p>With respect to the films' color, all systems exhibited a slightly whiter color during the test in the acidic solution. After being immersed in the alkaline medium, films without yerba mate extract did not show any change in color, while films containing extract notoriously did, as it can be seen at 𝑇 1 . All samples exhibited a yellow-orange-brown tone at 𝑇 1 , although for TPHS-Y10 and TPHS-Y20 it was lighter. According to the literature, the change in the color of the samples with the extract could be attributed to the anthocyanins (Shahid et al., 2013;Veiga-Santos et al., 2011) derived from cyanidin components of yerba mate (Ricco, Wagner, Giberti, &amp; Gurni, 1995). Color changes in the films containing yerba mate extract when the pH varies are relevant since these J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f systems could be used as food coatings, indicating the pH and therefore the quality of coated food, similarly as an intelligent packaging (Yoshida, Maciel, Mendonça, &amp; Franco, 2014). During storage, several food products suffer changes in pH due to their normal metabolic processes or as a consequence of bacterial contamination (Ma, Du, &amp; Wang, 2017). For example, the growth in the population of Pseudomonas in chicken breast fillets investigated by Wang et al. (2017) led to an increase in pH value.With respect to the films' color, all systems exhibited a slightly whiter color during the test in the acidic solution.
