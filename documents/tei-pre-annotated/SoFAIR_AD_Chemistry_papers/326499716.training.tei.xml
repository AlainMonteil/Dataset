        <p>Experiments and biomolecular simulations are revealing new and unexpected details of how enzymes are adapted to specific temperatures. These findings are elucidating enzyme evolutionary trajectories and offer great promise for design and engineering of natural and artificial enzymes. They also have implications for understanding responses of larger scale biological temperature dependence, relevant for understanding the effects of climate change on ecosystems. We review recent work on the temperature dependence of enzyme-catalysed reaction rates and the implications for enzyme evolution. Evidence from kinetic isotope effects, temperature dependent reaction rates, molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamics provides new insights into enzyme thermoadaptation and evolution.</p>
        <p>Enzymes compress the vast timescale over which chemical reactions take place (10 -9 -10 17 s) onto timescales needed for life (10 -3 -10 5 s). This involves enzyme-catalysed rate enhancements of up to 10 20 [1]. Experiments and molecular simulations have revealed mechanisms for enzyme-catalysed reactions and details of the fundamental origins of catalysis.</p>
        <p>Life not only faces the challenge of how to increase chemical reaction rates, but also of ensuring that the rates are appropriate for the physical conditions in which organisms live. Life occupies almost every available niche on the planet and thus, enzymes have evolved to operate at diverse temperatures (between -20°C and +120°C); enzymes have been tailored by evolution to operate optimally at the temperature(s) encountered by the organisms in which they function.</p>
        <p>For example, enzymes adapted to hot environments show significantly different optimum temperatures than those from organisms adapted to the cold; it is increasingly clear that these activity differences are not due only to differences in stability, but rather reflect a tailoring of enzyme dynamics by evolution.</p>
        <p>Research into the temperature dependence of enzyme catalysed reaction rates has a rich history that goes back at least 100 years [2]. A recent confluence of experiment and computation [3-5••,6,7••] points towards an emerging consensus regarding the molecular mechanisms for enzyme catalysis and the evolutionary adaptations that have occurred with changing environmental temperatures. Temperature also affects molecular dynamics and the relationship between dynamics and catalysis is controversial [8,9]. Advances in computational simulations along with new experimental approaches are being combined to address the relationship between enzyme catalysis, dynamics, temperature and evolution [10••-12].</p>
        <p>Enzyme-catalysed reaction rates are described well by transition state theory [13,14] (equation 1, the Eyring equation). The Eyring equation expresses the rate constant in terms of the free energy difference between the reactants (ground state) and the transition state (∆G ‡ = ∆H ‡ -T∆S ‡ ) modified by the transmission coefficient g(T) and the barrier-less frequency kBT/h where kB and h are the Boltzmann and Planck constants respectively. This predicts an exponential relationship between the chemical rate constant, kcat, and temperature. Wolfenden has suggested that if life evolved at elevated temperatures where uncatalysed reaction rates and their catalysed counterparts are relatively close [12] (Figure 1A), then as temperatures cooled, enzymes must have evolved to reduce ∆H ‡ to escape the exponential decline in rates with a decrease in temperature. This has been described as escaping the "tyranny of Arrhenius" as temperatures change over evolutionary time or organisms migrate between different environments [15].</p>
        <p>Several investigators have observed that enzymes achieve the required reduction in ∆H ‡ for the reaction at the expense of ∆S ‡ (an enthalpy-entropy trade off). Thermophilic enzymes are often much less active at lower temperatures than their mesophilic homologues (Figure 1A) and this has been attributed to a tradeoff between enthalpy and entropy [16]. Similarly, psychrophilic enzymes show significant activity at low temperatures at which their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts often show very low activity. Particularly for psychrophilic enzymes (enzymes from organisms whose environmental temperatures are below ~15 °C), the tradeoff was previously thought to come at the expense of enzyme stability whereby psychrophilic enzymes were regarded as generally very flexible and much less stable than their thermologues.</p>
        <p>Results from directed evolution and design, show that this view is overly simplistic. For example, a psychrophilic enzyme has been made more stable without loss of psychrophilic activity [17], and a thermophilic enzyme has been engineered to be more active at mesophilic temperatures without loss of stability [6]. Indeed, the role of neutral drift may be an important factor in the reduction of stability for psychrophilic enzymes in the absence of selection for stability at higher temperatures [18]. Many psychrophilic enzymes are properly folded and active catalysts at temperatures above their optima. Recent results for psychrophilic enzymes are providing insights into the molecular details of enzyme evolution [19,20].</p>
        <p>It has long been thought that thermophilic enzymes are generally more rigid, and psychrophilic enzymes are generally less rigid, than their mesophilic counterparts when compared at the same temperature. This belief gave rise to the 'corresponding states' hypothesis, [21] i.e. that each enzyme has similar flexibility and dynamics at their respective environmental temperatures (Figure 1A). The molecular origins of the enthalpy-entropy tradeoff (e.g. to achieve high activity at low temperatures) have been suggested to reside in the active site, with psychrophiles having more flexible active sites compared to their thermologues [22]. However, recent experimental and computational results from Brandsdal, Åqvist and colleagues show that the increased flexibility of psychrophiles resides at the periphery of the enzyme [23]. In an elegant set of computational experiments using molecular dynamics simulations with empirical valence bond (EVB) models, they showed that increasing rigidity at the periphery of an enzyme converts it from a psychrophile to a mesophile [11]. They have gone further to use this approach to engineer psychrophilic and mesophilic elastase enzymes [5••,24•].</p>
        <p>An intriguing feature of psychrophilic enzymes is that their temperature optima (Topt) often lie far below their unfolding temperatures (TM) [25]. This is the result of non-linear Arrhenius behaviour which is not due to denaturation. The trivial explanation for this behaviour is a change in the rate determining step with temperature, however this can often be excluded. This is a conundrum and has led to hypotheses about the possible molecular origins of non-linear</p>
        <p>Arrhenius behaviour [26][27][28].</p>
        <p>There is increasing evidence that the temperature dependence of many enzyme-catalysed reactions does not follow simple (linear) Arrhenius behaviour, but rather shows significant curvature, passing through a temperature of optimal activity (Topt). Such behaviour is accounted for by Macromolecular Rate Theory (MMRT, see below) [29]. Evidence for such behaviour has been accumulating and has been noted by many investigators. Models presented to account for this behaviour show some notable common features. For example, Daniel and Danson put forward a model for the temperature dependence of enzyme-catalysed rates that included both the catalytic and unfolding rate constants [30]. Their model (based on numerous experimental datasets for different enzymes) showed non-linear Arrhenius behaviour for many enzymes "at zero time" -i.e. in the absence of denaturation. Central to their model is that they postulate two conformations in equilibrium for the native enzyme, one active and the other inactive. This is reminiscent of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) and Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer (KNF) models for allosteric regulation of enzymes with two states [31]. Truhlar and Kohen showed that a more reactive and less reactive state in equilibrium account for non-linear</p>
        <p>Arrhenius behaviour [28]. If enzymes sample at least two conformational states in the ground state for the reaction and that this is compressed into a single conformation at the transition state, then this is sufficient to explain curvature in Arrhenius plots (Figure 1B). Glowacki and colleagues also invoke two conformations with different reactivities to account for anomalous temperature dependence of some kinetic isotope effects [9]. Two different conformations in the ground state with different activities has also been suggested to allow evolution towards new catalytic activities [32,33•].</p>
        <p>Warshel and colleagues have used EVB simulations to calculate free energy profiles for the reaction catalysed by alcohol dehydrogenase [10]. They calculated the contributions of ∆H ‡ and ∆S ‡ to the free energy barrier and showed that they were both temperature dependent. This temperature dependence was accentuated for the reaction with a deuterated substrate. These observations are sufficient to explain the increasingly curved Arrhenius plots for ADH with protiated and deuterated substrates, respectively. They proposed atomistic hypotheses for the experimental observations based on their calculations. The change in the temperaturedependence of ∆H ‡ between protiated and deuterated substrates is approximately</p>
        <p>, far exceeding what is expected for an H to D substitution in the substrate.</p>
        <p>Formally, the temperature dependence of ∆H ‡ defines the activation heat capacity ∆𝐶 ) ‡ -the change in heat capacity between the ground state and the transition state along the reaction coordinate [29].</p>
        <p>Pudney and colleagues observed a similar phenomenon for thermophilic glucose dehydrogenase (GDH): a single H to D substitution in the substrate changes ∆𝐶 ) ‡ for the reaction by a large amount: 2.3 kJ•mol -1 •K -1 [34]. Additional deuteration of the glucose substrate further reduces the magnitude of ∆𝐶 ) ‡ for the reaction (i.e. reduces the temperature dependence of ∆H ‡ ). ∆𝐶 ) ‡ was inferred by including this parameter in the Eyring equation and fitting temperature-rate data using this modified Eyring equation. Such large changes in heat capacity along the reaction coordinate arise because macromolecules such as enzymes can undergo significant changes in heat capacity due to conformational changes. These effects are explained by macromolecular rate theory (MMRT) [29].</p>
        <p>The activation heat capacity (at constant pressure) is defined as</p>
        <p>And this is related to the fluctuations in enthalpy and entropy via</p>
        <p>If an enzyme has two (or more) conformations in the ground state (as postulated by multiple authors, see above), which converge to one conformation at the transition state (Figure 1B), this will see a reduction in accessible conformations along the reaction coordinate and a negative value of the activation heat capacity ∆𝐶 ) ‡ . Similarly, if ∆H ‡ is temperature dependent (as found e.g. by Warshel and colleagues [10]), this also implies that the activation heat capacity is non-zero. Where ∆𝐶 ) ‡ is different from zero the corresponding Arrhenius plot will be non-linear (Figure 1C).</p>
        <p>Substituting equation 2 into the Eyring equation gives equation 4:</p>
        <p>and the corresponding curves for different values of ∆𝐶 ) ‡ can be seen in Figure 1C. 2).</p>
        <p>Recent work from Hilvert and colleagues points towards the emergence of increasingly negative ∆𝐶 ) ‡ values for laboratory-evolved enzymes as they improve their catalytic proficiency [39•]. The heat capacity for any species is a function of the vibrational density of states for the species and thus, ∆𝐶 ) ‡ also reports on the changes in the distribution of vibrational states for an enzyme along the reaction coordinate.</p>
        <p>The critical role that temperature plays in enzyme function in the context of evolution (as well as in biotechnology) means that this field is very active. Enzyme crystal structures are often determined at artificially low temperatures, and this, along with averaging (as well as the crystal conditions) may disguise vibrational modes relevant for biology. X-ray crystallography Temperature dependent conformational changes relevant to medicine are also being elucidated [43]. There is a growing recognition that investigations benefit significantly from bringing computational and experimental methods together to investigate the temperature dependence of enzyme-catalysed reaction rates [38,44]. Molecular simulations allow atomic-level analysis of protein dynamics and modelling of reactions (and e.g. transition states, see Figure 2), and calculations of thermodynamic properties such as activation enthalpies, entropies, and heat capacities [38]. They will be complemented by promising emerging approaches including incorporating machine learning to predict temperature optima for enzymes [ A computational molecular dynamics investigation of two diverse enzymes (large monomeric, small dimeric) using the fluctuations in enthalpy at the reactant state and the transition state to calculate the activation heat capacity (∆𝐶 ) ‡ , see equation 3). The calculated values were commensurate with experimental values determined from the temperature dependence of the catalytic rate constant. Notably, contributions to (∆𝐶 ) ‡ ) arise from all parts of the enzyme including the dimeric partner and auxiliary domains.</p>

        <p>Experimental directed evolution of a designed enzyme suggests that as the rate enhancement increases, activation heat capacity becomes more negative. This is consistent with the hypothesis that stabilization of the transition state leads to a narrowing of the enthalpic fluctuations at this state when compared to the ground state. It is also consistent with an enthalpy-entropy tradeoff in enzyme evolution. Temperature-jump experiments for cyclophilin A using small-and wide-angle X-ray scattering as the detector. Rich dynamics on the microsecond timescale are revealed by this approach. However, if there is a change in heat capacity along the reaction coordinate, as illustrated in B., then the observed temperature dependence will be according to the dashed lines of the same color (∆Cp ‡ = -10 and -5 kJ.mol -1 .K -1 for psychrophilic and mesophilic enzymes, respectively). The absolute rates that correspond to these dashed lines are shown in solid lines at the bottom and on the right-hand y axis. Note that the optimum temperature for the psychrophile is now 28 °C, and that for the mesophile is 60 °C, in the absence of denaturation.</p>
