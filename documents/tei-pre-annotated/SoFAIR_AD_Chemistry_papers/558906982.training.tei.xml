        <p>Textile wastewater heavy metal pollution has become a severe environmental problem worldwide. Metal ion inclusion in a dye molecule exhibits a bathochromic shift producing deeper but duller shades, which provides excellent colouration. The ejection of a massive volume of wastewater containing heavy metal ions such as Cr (VI), Pb (II), Cd (II) and Zn (II) and metalcontaining dyes are an unavoidable consequence because the textile industry consumes large quantities of water and all these chemicals cannot be combined entirely with fibres during the dyeing process. These high concentrations of chemicals in effluents interfere with the natural water resources, cause severe toxicological implications on the environment with a dramatic impact on human health. This article reviewed the various metal-containing dye types and their heavy metal ions pollution from entryway to the wastewater, which then briefly explored the effects on human health and the environment. Graphene-based absorbers, specially graphene oxide (GO) benefits from an ordered structured, high specific surface area, and flexible surface functionalization options, which are indispensable to realize a high performance of heavy metal ion removal. These exceptional adsorption properties of graphene-based materials support a position of ubiquity in our everyday lives. The collective representation of the textile wastewater's effective remediation methods is discussed and focused on the GO-based adsorption methods. Understanding the critical impact regarding the GO-based materials established adsorption portfolio for heavy metal ions removal are also discussed. Various heavy-metal ions and their pollutant effect, ways to remove such heavy metal ions and role of graphene-based adsorbent including their demand, perspective, limitation, and relative scopes are discussed elaborately in the review.Textile wastewater heavy metal pollution has become a severe environmental problem worldwide.

        <p>The rapid industrialisation, urbanisation and population have created huge stress on water usage and polluted drastically, which increase the demand for clean water. Water pollution has been attributed due to the ability of water to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on the earth. This characteristic makes water pollution easily, and water resources such as rivers, reservoirs, lakes and our ocean are drowning in chemicals, waste, plastics and other toxic pollutants. The number of individuals living in water scare areas will increase to around 3.9 billion by 2030, as assessed by the World Water Council. [1] The current and forthcoming water scarcity has increased the need for wastewater treatment and fit for household activities, industries or agricultural activities. Textiles manufacturing is a large industry globally that generates significant quantities of wastewater. Wastewater management and potable water purification are crucial to sustain human society's rapid development and mitigate environmental pollution and health hazards. Leaching harmful substances and accordingly, their contamination has come to be seen as a societal problem and has caused health problems for millions of people. Figure 1 shows the schematic representation of water pollution originates from industries effluent. Textile industrial wastewater pollution is a particular threat to water resources and a growing economy. An estimated 38354 million litres per day (MLD) sewage is generated in India's major cities, but the sewage treatment capacity is only of 11786 MLD. Similarly, only 60 % of industrial wastewater, mostly large-scale industries, is treated. India's environmental technology sector is expanding rapidly, with evident business opportunities for pollution abatement technology innovations. The United Nations (2015: 6.3) has specifically targeted improvements to "water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, having the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally" by 2030.

The discharge from different range of industries such as textile industries, paper and pulp industries, dye and dye intermediates industries, pharmaceutical industries, tannery industries, paint industries and kraft bleaching industries are considered a wide variety of organic pollutants introduced into the natural water resources from which textile industries (54 %) generates half of the existing dye effluents seen in the world-wide environment followed by the dyeing industries (21 %), paper and pulp industries (10 %), tannery and paint industries (8 %) and the dye manufacturing industries (7 %) shown in Figure 2.

It generates a massive impact on our ecosystem because around 10,000 different textile dyes are produced based on a colour index, resulting in the production of ~700,000 tons of dye production worldwide. [6] Among the effluent mentioned above, the textile industry's discharging industries play a major role in any other countries worldwide' economic development. Including India, globally few other countries play a predominant role in the textile industry: China, United States, Pakistan, Brazil, Indonesia, Taiwan, Turkey, Bangladesh, and South Korea. India is one of the largest textile producers, contributing 5 % of GDP (Gross domestic product), 14 % of the industrial production contribution and 13 % of export contribution earnings. Moreover, nearly 45 million peoples are directly employed by this industrial sector. The textile industry uses distinct types of raw materials such as cellulose fibre, protein fibre, and synthetic fibres. Cellulose cotton fibre plays a significant role in textile industry production, which is the backbone of this industry a 60 % share of earning. A study indicates that the textile industry consumes roughly 1.6 million litres of water per day for producing 8000 kg/day of fabric, out of which 8 % of water utilised for printing and 16 % of the water used in dyeing process which clearly shown in Figure 3. [7] In the textile industry, the fabric manufacturing procedure undergoes two main processes: mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical operation includes spinning, weaving and garmenting which requires less water, whereas chemical processing operations namely de-sizing, scouring, bleaching, mercerizing, dyeing, printing and finishing stages are required a considerable quantity of water. During the chemical process, bleaching and dyeing generate a massive amount of effluent which contains an immense volume of significant pollutants such like a higher concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), organic nitrogen, traces of heavy metals, dispersants, levelling agents, salts, carriers, acids, alkali and various dyes. Hence, above stated pollutants discharge degrades the water quality, spreading toxicity and seriously affects the photosynthesis activity in plants. Furthermore, it creates a massive impact on the aquatic environment because of low light penetration and insufficient oxygen consumption. Therefore, before discharging effluents must be adequately treated, increasing the significant focus on water reusability alternatives.Prof. Tapas Mallick is a Chair in Clean Technologies in the University of Exeter and experts in applied solar technologies.

        <p>The textile industries can be classified into two categories, such as dry fabric related and wet fabric-related industries. The dry fabric industry generates solid wastes, whereas the wet fabric industry generates liquid wastes. The textile industry uses a different type of raw materials namely cellulose fibres (cotton, viscose, linen, jute, hemp, lyocell and ramie), protein fibres (wool, silk, mohair, angora, cashmere and alpaca) and synthetic fibres (rayon, nylon, polyester, acetate, acrylic, ingeo, polypropylene acrylic, spandex polyester, polyamide, polyacrylonitrile, polyurethane, and polypropylene). Amongst these fibres, cellulose cotton and wool require more water than synthetic fibres due to the hydrophilic nature. In contrast, synthetic fibres are hydrophobic, which means it does not absorb the water. Natural fibres absorb water along with dyes and other chemicals. Each type of fibre is dyed using different types of dyes, namely reactive dyes, vat dyes, indigo dyes, direct dyes, naphthol dyes, acid dyes, basic dyes, sulphur dyes, disperse dyes and natural dyes, which are an unsaturated organic compound that absorbs light and give colour to the visible region. [8] The wet fabric industrial wastewater is the primary focus of this review. The amount of water utilised and an equivalent amount of wastewater generated as effluent from this wet dyeing process. The large quantities of dyes impart during the dyeing to the fabrics. A significant number of dyes are remaining unfixed in textile effluents that are toxic, carcino-genic and mutagenic to all living things. These toxic dyes can remain in the environment for an extended period when released without appropriate treatment. Therefore, several primary, secondary and tertiary treatment methods are available to treat the textile effluent mentioned above. The textile effluent treatments are categorised into three main types such as physical (oxidation, ozonation &amp;electrolysis), chemical (filtration, reverse osmosis, adsorption &amp; coagulation/flocculation) and biological methods (Enzymes &amp; microorganisms). These methods are used separately to treat the effluents, which highly depends on the type and quantum of pollutants load. Dyes give high dense colour to water and cause deceases like haemorrhage, ulceration of skin, nausea, severe irritation of skin and dermatitis. Generally, dye-containing wastewater is unacceptable because of their colour and carcinogenic, toxic and nonbiodegradability, thus causing huge environmental problems. [9,10,11] In general, polluted water components come under six categories: main ions, dissolved gases, biogenous substances, organic substances, microelements and pollutants. [12] Accordingly, textile effluent contains dyes, heavy metals and microorganism from which heavy metal examples such as Lead (Pb), Arsenic(As), Chromium (Cr), Nickel(Ni), Copper(Cu), Cadmium(Cd), Mercury(Hg), Zinc(Zn) etc., are known for their toxicity and worse effect in human health and environmental impact. Heavy metals are emerging from pretreatment, dyeing, printing and finishing steps due to the use of metal-containing chemicals and metal-containing complex dyes. For example, during textile processing chemicals from the catalyst, oxidising agents, fixing agent cross-linking agent etc., and for getting bright dark colours chrome or mordant dyes and metal complex dyes are utilised. Heavy metals considered high density exceeds 5 mg per cubic centimetre, which are non-biodegradable and harder to cleanse because of its complex chemical form. In general, textile industries are discharging a large amount of heavy metal such like Cr (VI), Cd (II), Pb (II) and Zn (II) are the most common metal ions found in textile effluents. Except for textile industry other heavy metals producing industries are paper industries, pharmaceuticals, electroplating, rubber and plastics, metal finishing, organic chemicals, timber and wood items, pesticides, tanneries, metal plating industries, mining industries etc., emit these noxious heavy metals to the environment which causes serious environmental issue across the world; hence it is essential to treat the textile effluent before discharge to protect the contamination through the food chain. As a result of an increase in pollution, it demands useful materials in significantly efficient, economic, and easy application and applicable for different pollutants. In this perspective, this review articles' main focus is to address the efficient and economical material and appropriate methods to remove the heavy metals from textile effluents. Even if several studies have been reported so far on removing a heavy metal, the efforts are still equally needed to efficiently detect heavy metals. For that graphene and its derivatives can be a potentially excellent selection. Graphene oxide-based nanocomposites received much attention and play an essential role in separation and purification technology because of their unique properties namely high surface area, minimal in size, surface modification ability, excellent conductivity, cost-effective synthesis and mainly biologically compatible.The textile industries can be classified into two categories, such as dry fabric related and wet fabric-related industries.

        <p>In textile processing, fibres are transformed into yarn and reshaped into the fabric and then undergo several textile processing stages. Generally, the textile processing operations divided into two categories, such as dry process and wet process. The dry process needs minimum water which includes the following steps (i) opening, blending, and mixing, (ii) carding, (iii) combing, (iv) spinning, (v) weaving and (vi) knitting. The wet process requires more water which includes the steps such as (i) sizing, (ii) desizing, (iii) scouring, (iv) bleaching, (v) mercerizing, (vi) Dyeing and (vii) printing and finishing as shown in Figure 4. Below is the explanation of the various steps. i Sizing is the first preparation step where sizing agents are included to strengthen the fibres and protect the breakage. ii Desizing is used to remove sizing materials before weaving. iii Scouring helps to remove the impurities from the fibres by using alkali solution usually sodium hydroxide, which helps to break down the natural oils, waxes, and surfactants and helps to emulsify and suspend impurities in the scouring bath. iv Bleaching is the step used to remove the fibre's unwanted colour by using chemicals like sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide. v Mercerizing is the continuous chemical process used to increase dye's ability, enhance brightness, and intensify the fibre appearance, during this process concentrated alkaline solution applied. An acid solution is used to wash the fibre before the dyeing. vi Dyeing is the process to impart colour on to the fibre.In textile processing, fibres are transformed into yarn and reshaped into the fabric and then undergo several textile processing stages.

        <p>During this process, many chemicals like metals, salts, surfactants, organic processing aids, sulphide and formaldehyde are added to improve dye adsorption onto the fibres where a large volume of water utilised in the dye bath, not only in the dye bath but also a large quantity of water used in rinsing step. vii Printing and Finishing is the last step in this process.During this process, many chemicals like metals, salts, surfactants, organic processing aids, sulphide and formaldehyde are added to improve dye adsorption onto the fibres where a large volume of water utilised in the dye bath, not only in the dye bath but also a large quantity of water used in rinsing step. vii Printing and Finishing is the last step in this process.</p>

        <p>Textile effluents contain high concentration dyes and chemicals and contain traces of heavy metal capable of causing several health-related issues and contain microorganism. Occasionally, heavy metals can occur naturally in the fibre structure.Textile effluents contain high concentration dyes and chemicals and contain traces of heavy metal capable of causing several health-related issues and contain microorganism. Occasionally, heavy metals can occur naturally in the fibre structure.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, it can be reintroduced into the textile fabric during manufacturing processes those comes from dyeing and finishing processes due to the use of high fastness and dye resistance properties. The heavy metal also occurs from four primary dyes: metal complex acid dyes, chrome acid dyes, reactive metal-containing dyes and direct metal-containing dyes. Heavy metals can also come from fibres' chemical treatment to improve resistance to light and wet factors and fabric bleaching processes where metals are used as catalysts for oxidants. [13] Heavy metal pollution through industrial waste is a serious environmental issue throughout the world. Heavy metals are a group of metals and metalloids with an atomic density of more than 4000 kg.m À 3 , atomic weights between 63.5 and 200.6 and gravity &gt; 5.0 [14] Lead, cadmium, copper, arsenic, nickel, chromium, zinc and mercury have been recognized as hazardous heavy metals, because of their high solubility in the aquatic environments. Besides, heavy metals can be absorbed by living organisms, which are toxic even at low concentration. These metals are harder to clean due to its complex chemical form and non-biodegradability. Moreover, the above-mentioned heavy metals are stable, toxic and carcinogenic, accumulation in living organisms cause a severe health problem. Our natural soil and natural water resources are noxiously polluted by these heavy metal discharge which then adsorbed by plants through contaminated soil and then entering other living organisms through the food chain, affecting the environmental activities. Apart from the textile industry, other heavy metal toxicities releasing industries are mining, electroplating, metal processing, battery manufacturing, tanneries, petroleum refining, paint manufacture, pesticides, pigment manufacture, printing and photographic industries. [15,16] World health organisation (WHO) and Environmental protection agency (EPA) set permissible discharge standard limit for heavy metal to control the environmental pollution, which is shown in Table 2. [17,18,19] When people continuously exposed to these toxic heavy metal causes various severe health-related deceases such as cancers and cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, neurological and endocrine disorders. [20,21,22] Heavy metal removal from inorganic effluent can be achieved by conventional treatment processes which include chemical precipitation, [23] electrochemical treatment, [24,25] adsorption, [26,27] coagulation-flocculation, [28] membrane separation, [29] ion exchange, [30,31] reverse osmosis and biological treatment [32] and so on. These methods are efficient in heavy metal removal even though they have some limitations such as high energy consumption, incomplete removal, secondary pollutants, high cost, high-energy requirements, and toxic sludge production. [33] According to the previous literature review, the adsorption process is one of the low expenses among these remediation methods, a highly efficient advantageous method for removing heavy metals. From that point of view, this review focuses on the adsorption of heavy metals from textile wastewater; specifically, metal ions such as chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb)and zinc (Zn).Alternatively, it can be reintroduced into the textile fabric during manufacturing processes those comes from dyeing and finishing processes due to the use of high fastness and dye resistance properties. The heavy metal also occurs from four primary dyes: metal complex acid dyes, chrome acid dyes, reactive metal-containing dyes and direct metal-containing dyes.

Besides, heavy metals can be absorbed by living organisms, which are toxic even at low concentration. These metals are harder to clean due to its complex chemical form and non-biodegradability. Moreover, the above-mentioned heavy metals are stable, toxic and carcinogenic, accumulation in living organisms cause a severe health problem. Our natural soil and natural water resources are noxiously polluted by these heavy metal discharge which then adsorbed by plants through contaminated soil and then entering other living organisms through the food chain, affecting the environmental activities. Apart from the textile industry, other heavy metal toxicities releasing industries are mining, electroplating, metal processing, battery manufacturing, tanneries, petroleum refining, paint manufacture, pesticides, pigment manufacture, printing and photographic industries. [15,16] World health organisation (WHO) and Environmental protection agency (EPA) set permissible discharge standard limit for heavy metal to control the environmental pollution, which is shown in Table 2. [17,18,19] When people continuously exposed to these toxic heavy metal causes various severe health-related deceases such as cancers and cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, neurological and endocrine disorders. [20,21,22] Heavy metal removal from inorganic effluent can be achieved by conventional treatment processes which include chemical precipitation, [23] electrochemical treatment, [24,25] adsorption, [26,27] coagulation-flocculation, [28] membrane separation, [29] ion exchange, [30,31] reverse osmosis and biological treatment [32] and so on. These methods are efficient in heavy metal removal even though they have some limitations such as high energy consumption, incomplete removal, secondary pollutants, high cost, high-energy requirements, and toxic sludge production. [33] According to the previous literature review, the adsorption process is one of the low expenses among these remediation methods, a highly efficient advantageous method for removing heavy metals. From that point of view, this review focuses on the adsorption of heavy metals from textile wastewater; specifically, metal ions such as chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb)and zinc (Zn).</p>

        <p>During textile processing, a diverse range of chemicals and auxiliary chemicals are consumed for achieving the appropriate quality of the textile fabric. The textile wastewater effluent contains various chemicals including chlorinated solvents, hydrocarbon solvents, oxygenated solvent, soils, waste fabrics soaked in grease and oil, together with dyestuffs and pigments which are utilised at various stages of textile manufacturing. As mentioned above, the chemicals are discharged mainly as wastewater effluent, which is highly toxic and hazardous to the environment. From this above table, hazardous substances have been identified for risk assessment studies of textile chemicals. Wastewater in textile mainly developed from four sectors which are pre-treatment, dyeing, printing and finishing. Wide range of heavy metals and salts is utilised in textile production and finishing, which is briefly listed in Table 3 and Table 4.During textile processing, a diverse range of chemicals and auxiliary chemicals are consumed for achieving the appropriate quality of the textile fabric.

        <p>Heavy metal pollution from textile has become a serious environmental issue that affects human health and ecological balance. Apart from the textile, chromium has been widely used in the metallurgy, electroplating, metal deep processing, steel manufacturing, atomic power plants, fungicides, tanning, printing, pigments, polishing, dye industries. [40,41,42,43] Chromium (Cr) is a harmful heavy metal and oxidation states ranging from + 2 to + 6. Among these ranges, the trivalent and hexavalent states are considered more toxic, non-biodegradable, carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic because of its oxidizing properties. [44,45,46] Cr (III) is one of the essential elements for living being's health at a low level with a nontoxic concentration of 0.20 mg/day whereas Cr (VI) is a strong carcinogenic and pestilential to humans and animals. Furthermore, chromium is categorized as group 1 carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) for animals and humans. The toxicity of hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) is normally 1000 times higher than that of Cr (III) trivalent chromium. [47] Accordingly, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the chromium content in drinking water must be &lt; 50 ppb or 0.05 mg L À 1 [48] and European Union require that the discharge of Cr (VI) to surface water should be below 50 μg L À 1 . [49] Chromium (VI) is dangerous to health when the limit (0.05 mg L À 1 ) exceeds in potable water. [50] Various methods available to treat this metal ion, including ion exchange, [40] photo-catalysis, [51,52] electrochemical flocculation, [53] membrane separation, [54,55] chemical precipitation, [56,57] ion exchange [58] and adsorption [59,60,61] have been used to decontaminate chromium ions from aqueous solution and reach the WHO permissible limit. Among these methods, adsorption is a highly efficient method due to its simple operation, high efficiency, and economic feasibility. [62,63] Adsorbents, such as activated carbon, [64] ion-exchange resins, [65] inorganic nanomaterials, [66] and natural waste material [67] were reported to remove chromium ions in wastewater. Because of the limitations of these materials such as high cost, slow and less amount of adsorption efficiency enhanced the demand for low-cost adsorbent with high removal efficiency. Table 3.

        <p>Groundwater contamination is one of the most serious environmental issues which results through anthropogenic activities and atmospheric input, [68,69] therefore World Health Organization (WHO) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set the maximum permissible discharge limit in both the consumable water and wastewater can only be 6.0 × 10 À 3 mg L À 1 . [70] Heavy metal pollution is associated with primarily industrial wastewater, wastewater producing industries such as dyeing textile, hydrometallurgical, tanning, smelting of ores, metal plating, battery industries, fertilizers and herbicides production, motor, electrochemical, house paint, gasoline additives and plumbing pipes, [71] carry heavy metals such as Cr (III,VI), As(III,V), Cd(II), Pb(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Hg(II) which are dangerous to the environment and living organisms, among these lead (Pb) one of the toxic heavy metal due to its non-biodegradable harmful effect. Exposure to lead can cause digestive problems, neurological disorders, high blood pressure, reproductive health problems, kidney dysfunction, muscle and joint pain, fertility problems in adults, and the most lead exposure, leading to damage to the developing brains of infants and young children. Several conventional treatment techniques have been applied for the removal of Pb (II) which are flocculation, ion exchange, reduction, membrane filtration, solvent extraction, biosorption, chemical precipitation, reverse osmosis, adsorption, etc. [72,73] Most of these methods have numerous limitations such as high operational cost, huge capital investment and secondary pollutants disposal complications. Accordingly, many researchers reported that the adsorption method is considered to be highly effective and economical at present. [14,74] Adsorption of heavy metal ions on to different solid support such as ion exchange resins, activated charcoals, zeolites and ion chelating agents that are highly effective and economical as easy regeneration process besides these agents usually inactive on inorganic supports for decontamination of industrial wastewater effluents. Many researchers are currently focusing on the latest treatment technology method to remove lead, therefore aspiration towards achieving and exploring efficient adsorbents to improve the adsorption effectiveness. Specifically, the carbonaceous materials have been proved to be effective adsorbents for removing metal ions because of welldeveloped internal pore structure, large surface area, and mainly containing a wide range of functional groups. Multiple reports indicated that a carbon surface's oxidation treatment increases the functional groups' mainly oxygen-containing group with high adsorption [75] potential of metal ions and its hydrophilicity. [76,77] From that perspective, recently large numbers of adsorbents were investigated, for example, carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, clay minerals, microorganisms, and plant and agricultural wastes, among which graphene oxide (GO) has been in the centre of attention [78,79,80] due to its unique two-dimensional structure and large specific surface area (~2600 m 2 .g À 1 ), researchers stated that the graphene becomes an incomparable perfect material for the adsorption of heavy metal ions. [79] Therefore oxidation of graphite to GO with increased functional groups enhance the removal efficiency of heavy metal ion and their complexes from water; additionally, GO can be recycled, and reusable capabilities, from this point of view the adsorption of lead Pb(II) over GO, functional groups exist on the surface of GO plays a crucial role, and adsorption ability of GO was found to be higher than graphite; therefore the author concluded that GO could be a promising material for the removal of lead that present in wastewater.

[83] Due to the discharge effluent from different sources to accessible drinking water bodies, the higher cadmium concentrations are found in a few types of fish, mussels, and clams in the contaminated seaside regions. This metal toxic brings out the health effects such as lung cancer, respiratory problem, kidney, liver and reproductive organs.

Waste concentrations of zinc range from less than 1 to more than 48,000 mg L À 1 . However, the presence or exposer of zinc in excess causes eminent health problems, such as stomach cramps, nausea, skin irritations, cramps, vomiting, and anaemia.

        <p>Acid dyes are water-soluble anionic dyes, mostly applied on natural fibres such as wool, silk, mohair, angora, alpaca and synthetic polyamide like nylon, slightly to acrylic and blended of these materials. Generally, affinity in cellulosic fibre is very poor; most acid dyes are sodium salts of aromatic sulphonic acids and some carboxyl groups acid dye. Commonly acid dyes contain 1-4 sulphonic acid groups in the dye structure and the molecular weights range from 300 to 800. Metal complex acid dyes or pre-metallised dyes are complexed with acid dyes formed combined transition metal called metal complex acid dyes which are economical and produce excessive light fastness and wet fastness. Metal complex acid dyes are brighter than chrome dyes but duller than acid dyes. Chrome mordant dyes are widely used in high-quality fibres because of their easy application and colour fastness properties. Metal complex acid dye has two different groups which are acidic dyeing 1 : 1 metal complex and neutral dyeing 1 : 2 metal complex acid dyes which mean one dye molecule is combined with one metal atom in acidic condition and two dye molecules is combined with one metal ion in neutral dyeing which briefly discussed in the metal complex dye category.Acid dyes are water-soluble anionic dyes, mostly applied on natural fibres such as wool, silk, mohair, angora, alpaca and synthetic polyamide like nylon, slightly to acrylic and blended of these materials.

        <p>formation. Metal-complex dyes generally cannot be said as belonging to a particular application dye. Metal-complex dyes belong to numerous application classes of dyes. For example, they are found among direct, acid, and reactive dyes. When applied in the dyeing processes, metal-complex dyes are used in pH conditions regulated by user class and fibre type (wool, polyamide, etc.). class. These dyes are generally used to dye wool, silk and nylon to produce fast shades. In metal complex dyes, dye molecule and atom are combined with the specific composition either 1 : 1 or 1 : 2, which means one atom combined with one dye molecule or one atom combined with two dye molecules. For example, the dye molecule could be a mono azo group containing hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino, capable of forming a potent coordination complex with transition metal ions such as chromium cobalt, nickel and copper. There are two reasons for metals present in dyes, and firstly metals are used as catalysts during the manufacturing of dyes so that metals can be present as impurities. Secondly, in some dyes, the metals are chelated with the dye molecule to form an integral structural element. Metal content in different dye types mentioned in Table 8. [104] Besides copper, chromium, cobalt and nickel complexed reactive dyes are used to produce turquoise blue and brilliant green; alternatively, ecological issues have forced dye manufacturers to introduce phthalocyanine groups with comparable results. [105] Due to their ease of application and fastness properties, they are used for dyeing high-class dress materials. Chemically speaking, metal complex dyes can be broadly classified into two classes. 1 : 1 metal-complexes, where, one organic molecule gets coordinated with a single metal atom (Figure 6a). Besides, in 1 : 2 metal complexes, one metal atom is co-ordinated with double organic molecules. Both ionic and coordinates bonds are formed with metal complex dyes and fibre (Figure 6b). Figure 6c represents the Cu's chemical structure containing metal complex dyes, which generates different colours byformation.

The above mentioned four metals are soluble in perspiration at varying extents, showing a negative impact on human health and our ecosystem. A research stated that 1 : 1 metalcomplex dyes of copper, nickel, cobalt or zinc metal ions with 5-cyano-6-methyl-2-2'-bipyridine were highly effective on protein fibres. [106] These metal complex dyes are currently available in the market, mainly containing Chromium and Cobalt metals in the chemical structure; these types of metal dyes are developed in 1915. Chromium metal is widely used in two different oxidation states: trivalent Chromium Cr (III) and hexavalent chromium Cr (VI). [105] 1 : 2 metal complex dyes are mainly used in wool dying which provide extreme colour fastness to wet treatments, thus increased the utilisation of 1 : 2 metal complex dyes compared to 1 : 1 metal complex dye; further their advantages and limitations are shown in Table 9. Chromium complexed dyes are predominantly used on substrates due to the high light and wash fastness qualities which not found in other dyes. [107] In the colour index, metal complex dyes are incorporated in the acid dye group, closely related to chrome mordant dyes. Chrome mordant dyes have some limitations; therefore, acid dyes are preferred by the dyer's point of view. Metal complex dyes are brighter than chrome dyes but duller than acid dyes. Chrome mordant dyes are used in high-quality fibres because of their easy application and colour fastness properties. In the decade 1940-50,1 : 1 metal complex dye had been established in wool dyeing and 1951 Geigy developed a new series of 1 : 2 metal complex dyes under the trade name 'Irgalan'. Metal complex dyes are found among 65 % of acid dyes, 12 % reactive dyes and 10 % of direct dyes, during dyeing process metal complex dyes used under certain pH conditions which are regulated by the user class of dyes and the fibre category such as wool and polyamide etc., The pH level for the wool fibre typically from 1.8 to 4 which is strongly acidic for 1 : 1 metal complex dye category and for 1 : 2 metal complex category pH range from 4 to 7 which is moderately acidic neutral. Examples of dyes containing bound metals are copper and nickel in phthalocyanine groups, copper in blue copper-azo-complex reactive dyes and chromium in metal-complex dyes used for wool silk polyamide. The standard discharge limits for heavy metals are strict due to animals' toxicity and aquatic life. Metal-complex dyes contain chelated chromium, cobalt, copper, lead and nickelmetal ions. Some cationic dyes contain zinc and trace concentrations of mercury, cadmium, and arsenic as impurities from intermediates. The metal is an integral part of the dye molecule, non-biodegradable and potential for bioaccumulation. Further, the treatment methods such as filtration and adsorption on activated sludge, which remove the dye from the wastewater, also reduce the amount of bound metal in the final effluent.

The application process is called naphtholation; naphthol dyes are classified as fast dyes cheaper than vat dyeing, containing insoluble azo group (À N=NÀ ) known as azoic dyes. The naphthols are phenols, soluble in alkaline solution and good affinity to cotton, particularly salt. Azoic dyes were introduced in 1881 by Reed Holiday which is generally called as ice colours or azoic colours, the first dye obtained from -naphthol and diazotized 4-nitroaniline, known as Para Red. It gives a wide range of colours such as yellows, orange, scarlet, red, blues, black and few greens. Naphthol dyes are recommended for bright and fast shades in maximum depth similar to vat dyeing. For the past few decades, these dyes' usage reduced due to the ecotoxicology and carcinogenic of some azoic diazo components derived from amines. Advantages are low dyeing cost, excellent fastness properties, which produce full bright depths that are not achievable from other dyes. Limitations are application procedure, which is a time-consuming process and complicated and have poor lightfastness in light shades.Azoic are also called naphthalene dyes which are waterinsoluble, mainly used for cellulose fibres, particularly cotton, rayon, and other cellulosic fibres including silk.

Oral ingestion and inhalation issues come under acute toxicity; genotoxicity is the significant long-term potential health hazard of few textile dyes.

        <p>Environmental Pollutions such as dyes, organic pollutants, heavy metals are widely contaminating the aquatic ecosystem. However, these methods are not used widely due to their high cost and economic disadvantage. An adsorption technique is the most versatile and widely used techniques for water purification. The most common adsorbent materials are alumina-silica, metal hydroxides and activated carbon. Many researchers proved that removing dyes by activated carbon is economically favourable and technically easier. Activated carbon is widely used as an adsorbent due to its high adsorption capacity, high surface area, microporous structure, and a high degree of surface, respectively. Another technique for removing dye molecules is photocatalytic degradation by semiconducting nanomaterials. These nanoscale particles are promising in this area due to their unique properties such as small particle sizes, large surface to volume ratio and UVvisible absorption properties. Thus the removal of poisonous hazardous substances from water is a significant environmental challenge, hence during the last decades' researcher have developed many tools and techniques to identify, monitor, assess and to treat the aqueous environment, which are coagulation, flocculation, adsorption, bioremediation, mem-brane separation, oxidation, ion exchange, ozonation, chlorination, electrochemical and chemical precipitation have been developed and widely used to eliminate the toxic and hazardous substances.

However, these methods are not used widely due to their high cost and economic disadvantage. An adsorption technique is the most versatile and widely used techniques for water purification. The most common adsorbent materials are alumina-silica, metal hydroxides and activated carbon. Many researchers proved that removing dyes by activated carbon is economically favourable and technically easier. Activated carbon is widely used as an adsorbent due to its high adsorption capacity, high surface area, microporous structure, and a high degree of surface, respectively. Another technique for removing dye molecules is photocatalytic degradation by semiconducting nanomaterials.

        <p>In coagulation, Coagulant is used to increase the density of colloidal form. The coagulant's effectiveness depends on the coagulant types, the dosage of coagulant, pH, temperature, alkalinity, and depends upon the mixing conditions. In this process, chemical reagents or inorganic flocculants like Al 2 (SO 4 ) 3 , Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 and FeCl 3 [112] and derivatives of these materials such as poly aluminium chloride and poly ferric chloride were used as flocculants in the wastewater effluent treatment process. Even though coagulation is efficient for removing heavy metals from wastewater, the main disadvantage is that it generates secondary pollutants that will be harmful to both the human and environmental ecosystem; therefore, it has to undergo further secondary treatment for the complete removal. Additionally, it produces enormous sludge formation due to the extensive utilisation of chemicals, limiting its wide usage range. After the coagulation process, the sludge formation contained heavy metals like cadmium, chromium, nickel, lead and zinc.In coagulation, Coagulant is used to increase the density of colloidal form.

        <p>Ion exchange is a separation process which substitutes the ions with one another for the high removal efficiency. Comparatively the sludge production is low in this method, which is the greatest advantage. Ion exchange resins are cross-linked, long-chain organic polymer, microporous and carrying exchangeable ions. These resins are classified into two types such as synthetic and natural resins; among these, synthetic resins are widely favoured than the natural resins to separate the metals infinitely. [113] The only disadvantage in this process is fouling of matrix happens in high concentrated metal solution. [114] Further, the main drawback is secondary pollutants caused by ion exchange resin's regeneration. In addition to that, operational cost is high. Furthermore, it cannot be utilised in large scale industries for wastewater treatment.

        <p>Removal of a pollutant metal-ion is employing by three basic mechanisms such as simple interaction, introducing magnetic nanomaterials and make a magnetic graphene-based composite, and composite with other nanostructure materials like core-shell, matrix-dispersed, mesoscale, lamellar, heterodimer, colloidal etc. as explained schematically in Figure 10. In case of the treatment, the viscous GO shows prominent interaction due to its negatively charged surface for COOÀ and OHÀ ions, which spread to produce a practical arrangement with the positive charge metal ions rapidly and thus removes the pollutant ions, this is the simplest way of interaction. Measurement of zeta potential and Raman spectroscopy will help understand the electrostatic interaction. Besides, the GO sheet interact strongly with metal ions are attracted to GO sheets via non-covalent bonds: hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, π-π stacking and hydrophobic interaction. However, allowing this mechanism restricts the multiple GO sheet or related catalysts. Thus, to rectify the reuse cycle, the GO-sheets or related graphene-based material making composite with the magnetic nanomaterials is because if the GO-based material is magnetic it will be easy to separate them from the wastewater and the overall process is a quite facile, time-saving, and swift process. But the thing is, making such a magnetic composite is quite tricky, also after completing the composite, the magnetic nanomaterial loses its magnetic property even. Another mechanism establishes related to the surface modification of GO, maybe with a few ligands, polymers, or developing nanocomposite structures. All the mechanisms mentioned above are the primary way to attract the pollutant metal ion towards GO or its related materials. After interacting with the metal ions, the GO can undergo either photocatalytic or adsorption mechanism to remove the wastewater's metal-ion pollutant.

        <p>Several adsorption kinetics have been established to understand the adsorption kinetics and adsorption rate. Those include the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, the Weber and Morris sorption kinetic model, the Adam -Bohart-Thomas relation, the first order reversible reaction model, the external mass transfer model, the first-order equation of Bhattacharya and Venkobachar, intraparticle diffusion, Elovich's equations and Ritchie's equation. The kinetics prediction in the adsorption mechanism determines adsorption equilibrium time and adsorption rate. The pseudo-first-order and pseudo-secondorder kinetics are most widely used to study the adsorption kinetics of pollutants and quantify the extent of uptake in adsorption kinetics. The pseudo-first-order is discovered which is suitable for the first 20-30 min of interaction period and the adsorption rate of limiting step is physisorption. [174] The adsorption may be physical or chemical, depending on the interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbents. Physisorption depends on the adsorbent's surface area, as the surface area of the adsorbent increases, the extent of adsorption also increases. The rise in sorbate amount at the interface is due to non-specific van der Waals forces in physical adsorption. In contrast, pseudo-second-order fixes the rate-limiting step as chemical adsorption, including the sharing of valence forces or electron exchanges between the adsorbate and adsorbent. Chemical adsorption is also known as Chemisorption. In chemisorption, adsorption occurs in adsorbed substances held by chemical bonds that create ionic bonds or covalent bonds. Chemisorption has a particular uniqueness, and it takes place only if there is a chemical bonding between adsorbent and adsorbate.

        <p>Adsorption capability of GO could be controlled by the total available surface area, which could be tailored by the microstructure. Sometimes, the coupling of the primary material with GO could enhance the adsorption reaction. Functionalisation plays a remarkable role in the interaction of removing heavy metals. Carbonaceous materials including activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes both single-walled and multi-walled (CNTs), and graphene oxide (GO) have been widely studied for adsorption of various environmental contaminants. Generally, the chemical and physical interactions between heavy metals and functional groups of adsorbents contribute significantly to heavy metals' adsorption. In addition, surface functionalization (surface modification) is essential to make the GO more soluble and stable in aqueous media (hydrophilicity). Sometimes lack of surface functional groups limits GO's application potential. Hence, surface modification of carbon materials enhances their surface properties of carbon adsorbents such as specific surface area, pore size distribution or pore volume, increasing functional groups' presence and enriching structural stability. Construction of functional groups on carbon surface is commonly occurring through three main techniques: oxidation, nitrogenation and sulfuration, which are utilised to introduce the oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur heteroatoms on the sp 2 -carbon surface .

( 2020) recently studied the Langmuir adsorption capacities (q max. ) of GO for various metal ions like metallic hard (Na + , Mg 2 + ), soft (Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + ) and borderline ions (Ni 2 + , Cu 2 + , Zn 2 + , Co 2 + ). They found the q max in order of Na + &lt; Mg 2 + &lt; Co 2 + &lt; Cd 2 + &lt; Zn 2 + &lt; Ni 2 + &lt; Cu 2 + &lt; Pb 2 + . Their studies presume to extend the prediction of adsorption behaviour of various metallic ions at adsorbents with known surface morphology (Figure 12). [187] Further, the adsorption capacity and application of GO and related composite materials for removing heavy metal ions from wastewater has been briefly summarized in Table 15 and Table 16, respectively.</p>

The adsorption equilibrium of Zn (II) onto GO increased within 20 min time, which was well fitted with pseudo-second-order kinetic rate and Langmuir adsorption isotherms with maximum adsorption capacity 246 mg. g À 1 at 293 K.

        <p>* Graphene and its functionalized composites play a significant role in heavy metal removal such as Cr, Pb, As, Zn, Cu, Hg, Cd etc., from wastewater figured out from the extensive literature of this review. * Graphene and its functionalized composites are predominantly used in wastewater decontamination process due to its surface area, many highly efficient functional groups, and high mobility charge carriers. * Graphene-based materials are the best replacement for the other carbon-based water filter because graphene can be applied for all types of impurities in wastewater treatment and which also provide highly potentially efficient results in heavy metal removal, organic pollutants etc.; hence, it can be used as the potential substitute in industries for the purification of wastewater with organic effluents above the prescribed limits. * The obstacles which need to be overcome are things such as mass production and graphene quality. To thrive metal-ion removal capacity requires a large area, defect-free, grain boundary-free, monocrystalline graphene to be readily available and unfortunately, to date that has not been achieved. It is debatable that it exhibits some toxic qualities. * Production of high-quality graphene is expensive, containing a complex fabrication process, involving toxic chemicals, and restricted chemical reactions. Besides, it requires a high temperature during the growth process and at the same time susceptive to the oxidative atmosphere. * To overcome the costly synthesis process of graphene, it is required to make graphene from natural resources or modify the physicochemical properties of GO or rGO to get a highquality performance similar to graphene. GO, or rGO is readily and cheaply scalable for industrial production, but suffers from the lesser surface area, and degraded thermoelectrical quality. * Therefore, GO's challenges in retaining the favourable adsorbent properties in terms of porosity, crystallinity, and ease of processing. As such, future avenues of graphenebased adsorbent research to achieve natural environmental friendliness and cost-effective will undoubtedly stem from the interplay between laboratory scale to industrial scale experimental discoveries. * Nevertheless, considering the optimization of reaction procedures and environmentally friendly synthetic routes, graphene and graphene oxide will achieve more costeffective industrialization acceptance. Also, few functional modifications methods should be developed, such as nonalkali carbonylation and carbon-carbon multi-bond addition reactions, which are rarely reported in GO and further its adsorption characteristics. * There are still many open issues and opportunities for further research efforts. Accordingly, more studies are also needed to make full use of the outstanding structural and electronic properties of GO in the composite adsorbent. * Purifying water using today's technology is expensive and energy-intensive; there is a pressing need for new research to identify novel approaches to purify water at a lower cost, use less energy, and significantly minimise the impact on the environment.
