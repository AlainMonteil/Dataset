        <p>A 'principles and practice' tutorial-style review of the application of solution-phase NMR in the analysis of the mechanisms of homogeneous organic and organometallic reactions and processes. This review of 345 references summarises why solution-phase NMR spectroscopy is uniquely effective in such studies, allowing non-destructive, quantitative analysis of a wide range of nuclei common to organic and organometallic reactions, providing exquisite structural detail, and using instrumentation that is routinely available in most chemistry research facilities. The review is in two parts. The first comprises an introduction to general techniques and equipment, and guidelines for their selection and application. Topics include practical aspects of the reaction itself, reaction monitoring techniques, NMR data acquisition and processing, analysis of temporal concentration data, NMR titrations, DOSY, and the use of isotopes. The second part comprises a series of 15 Case Studies, each selected to illustrate specific techniques and approaches discussed in the first part, including in situ NMR ( 1/2 H, 10/11 B, 13 C, 15 N, 19 F, 29 Si, 31 P), kinetic and equilibrium isotope effects, isotope entrainment, isotope shifts, isotopes at natural abundance, scalar coupling, kinetic analysis (VTNA, RPKA, simulation, steady-state), stopped-flow NMR, flow NMR, rapid injection NMR, pure shift NMR, dynamic nuclear polarisation, 1 H/ 19 F DOSY NMR, and in situ illumination NMR.A 'principles and practice' tutorial-style review of the application of solution-phase NMR in the analysis of the mechanisms of homogeneous organic and organometallic reactions and processes.

        <p>This review discusses the application of NMR in the investigation of the mechanism of homogeneous organic and organometallic reactions, and is based on the hands-on research experience of the authors [1]. The stimulus for the review stems from a meeting when a newly joined member of the team asked some practical questions about how best to go about analysing a specific aspect of a reaction that they were investigating by in situ NMR. Many of the group members felt that the answers that they provided were ones they had heard many times before, but that the questions were also ones that at some point in their career they too had asked. We concluded that an assembly of the collective experience of the group in the interrogation of reaction mechanisms using NMR, in a practical guide or 'compendium', would be useful, for the group and perhaps also for others. This guide covers the basic principles, both physical and chemical, behind the various approaches to the elucidation of reaction mechanism using NMR, as well as practical advice and hard-won experience: the 'tips, tricks, and traps' that are more customarily conveyed by the mentor-mentee relationship in the research laboratory. It aims to present these topics at a level accessible to a first-year graduate student, and to be comprehensive enough to provide them with everything they will require to begin to engage competently, productively, and confidently in the NMR investigation of reaction mechanisms. A series of 15 'Case Studies', drawn from work in the authors' group and from the general literature, is used to illustrate the principles and practical aspects of each of the specific techniques presented, together with 345 references to the primary literature, reviews, textbooks, and websites. An extended Glossary is also provided.This review discusses the application of NMR in the investigation of the mechanism of homogeneous organic and organometallic reactions, and is based on the hands-on research experience of the authors [1].

        <p>Before going into the details of how to approach mechanism using NMR, it is not unreasonable to question the motivations for doing this, for example, why study reaction mechanism at all, and why, in many cases, is NMR so well suited to this. The motivations for the mechanistic study of a chemical reaction or process are diverse. From the perspective of pedagogy, mechanisms provide a means of classification, simplification and correlation; for example, a general understanding of the mechanistic factors that govern the feasibility of an S N 1 reaction means that one does not need to memorise every known example. From the perspective of research, both academic and industrial, mechanisms provide a framework by which the outcomes of reactions can be predicted, explained, compared, and evaluated, and new reactions, reagents, and catalysts developed in a logical manner. Mechanism also allows the design and tuning of molecular function, an essential component in the development of modern materials, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. From the perspective of industrial production, knowledge of mechanism allows an informed refinement of a process -an apparently marginal improvement of yield from 99% to 99.5% represents a doubling in efficiency, when considered in terms of loss of the substrate. At the multitonne scale this has major implications in terms of the economic costs, energy input, and environmental impact in the generation and disposal of waste streams from purification steps. Mechanism is also essential in the defence of intellectual property, and in its challenge, and bypass. And finally, there is the role of curiosity: there is deep intellectual challenge and reward in the elucidation of the mechanism(s) by which a chemical reaction proceeds, and in the development of overarching and widely-applicable mechanistic concepts.Before going into the details of how to approach mechanism using NMR, it is not unreasonable to question the motivations for doing this, for example, why study reaction mechanism at all, and why, in many cases, is NMR so well suited to this.

        <p>The detailed investigation of mechanism is not a trivial undertaking but should not be viewed as impenetrable. One of the key factors governing success is a preparedness to devote the time and effort required for the acquisition, curation, and interrogation of large sets of data. This takes patience, and perhaps more demandingly, an intellectual plasticity in which creation and testing of an evolving series of hypotheses must be conducted simultaneously with critical evaluation of the growing collection of data. Ignoring dogma, thinking 'outside of the box', and a willingness to drop the current hypothesis for a new one, rather than the natural inclination to continue to defend it by ignoring inconsistent results, can make the crucial difference between success and an ultimately frustrating and expensive journey of selfdelusion. A key aspect, often overlooked, is that chemical intuition, or the influence of prior studies of others, can lead to chemical or physicochemical phenomena being assumed to occur, without justification. As emphasised by the late Joseph F. Bunnett: ''Don't make verifiable assumptions!" [2] -many assumptions, usually relating to 'simple' steps or processes, prove to be not entirely valid when rigorously tested, and some prove to be completely invalid. Their careful scrutiny can lead to valuable new directions in a study.The detailed investigation of mechanism is not a trivial undertaking but should not be viewed as impenetrable.

        <p>Chemical reaction mechanisms are primarily a description of the molecular, and sometimes physicochemical, choreography of a reaction -in terms of energy, structure and timescales. Fundamental to this is the correct identification of the products, and side products, of the reaction, and if not too transient, any intermediates, or 'off pathway' equilibria. The stoichiometry involved in the decay of the substrates, and growth of intermediates and products, must be identified, and the fluxes of these species as a function of time analysed. Side reactions provide mechanistically valuable information. Thus, unless absolutely necessary, for example due to spectral congestion, the reaction conditions should not be adjusted to severely attenuate or eliminate them. The selectivity of the reaction must also be accounted for, as well as any changes in this as a function of temperature, concentration, medium, and additives etc. The mechanisms of reactions should ideally be studied under the conditions in which they are applied (concentrations, solvent, temperature, etc.), and any catalysts or inhibitors, if present, identified.Chemical reaction mechanisms are primarily a description of the molecular, and sometimes physicochemical, choreography of a reaction -in terms of energy, structure and timescales.

        <p>Solution-phase NMR spectroscopy most often proves ideal for many or all of the above requirements. It is non-destructive, is quantitative (with appropriate experimental set-up) thus allowing determination of concentrations, is applicable to a wide range of nuclei common in organic and organometallic reactions, provides exquisite structural detail, is reasonably sensitive -particularly at the concentrations used in synthesis -and the instrumentation is routinely available, most often as a shared facility, in nearly every chemistry research department worldwide.Solution-phase NMR spectroscopy most often proves ideal for many or all of the above requirements.

        <p>Whilst alternative techniques offer other advantages, e.g. rapid data acquisition by UV or IR, the extremely high sensitivity of mass-spectrometry, and the (static) atomic resolution of X-ray diffraction, and should always be employed when beneficial, none of these techniques have the flexibility and amenability to application under 'normal' reaction conditions that makes NMR, in the authors' opinion, by far the most powerful general tool for the interrogation of reactions. As a research group that has focussed for the last twenty five years almost exclusively on the investigation of organic reaction mechanisms, we have embraced NMR whole-heartedly. In doing so, we have explored a very wide range of reaction classes, each with their own challenges in terms of approach of analysis, reaction conditions, temperature, velocity, symmetry, resolution, complexity of kinetics, etc. We have also developed new techniques to aid us in these studies, as well as considerable expertise in the synthesis and application of isotopically-labelled species. Along the way we have made mistakes, then identified, rectified and learned from them; and in many cases these events have proved crucial in the outcome of later studies. Indeed, one should seek to find satisfaction in proving the current hypothesis wrong, and using this as the impetus for generation of the next.Whilst alternative techniques offer other advantages, e.g. rapid data acquisition by UV or IR, the extremely high sensitivity of mass-spectrometry, and the (static) atomic resolution of X-ray diffraction, and should always be employed when beneficial, none of these techniques have the flexibility and amenability to application under 'normal' reaction conditions that makes NMR, in the authors' opinion, by far the most powerful general tool for the interrogation of reactions.

        <p>A number of practicalities need to be taken into account in order to effectively monitor reactions and analyse their mechanism by NMR, and we start by briefly discussing some key points. These include general principles for NMR spectroscopy and choice of instrument, ex situ versus in situ analysis, choice of internal standard, solvent, nucleus, and instrument parameters, and the identification of conditions when specialised techniques are required.A number of practicalities need to be taken into account in order to effectively monitor reactions and analyse their mechanism by NMR, and we start by briefly discussing some key points.

        <p>When conducting mechanistic work, one should bear in mind the general principles of the NMR experiment [3][4][5][6][7], the equipment available, and the scope and limitations of the information that can be elicited. Most experimentalists have limited access to a small range of NMR instruments. Prior to conducting a detailed mechanistic study relying heavily on NMR it is therefore useful to understand the key parameters that affect what it will be possible to achieve with the facilities available. Standard NMR spectrometers for solution phase chemistry come in two classes: high field and low field. They both operate on the same principles, and almost all of the reaction monitoring techniques discussed in this review can, in principle, be performed on either type. High field spectrometers, typically in the range 200 to 600 MHz ( 1 H), employ cryogenically-cooled superconducting electromagnets, usually stand taller than a human, require dedicated laboratory space, and are expensive to purchase and maintain. Nonetheless, the quality of the spectra obtained makes them ubiquitous in chemistry research. In contrast, low field spectrometers, typically 40-80 MHz ( 1 H), use permanent magnets, are smaller, portable, much cheaper to buy and to operate, and are often referred to as 'benchtop spectrometers'. Developments over the past two decades have led to benchtop instruments with sufficient sensitivity and resolution for some reaction monitoring applications [8][9][10].When conducting mechanistic work, one should bear in mind the general principles of the NMR experiment [3][4][5][6][7], the equipment available, and the scope and limitations of the information that can be elicited.

        <p>The greatest functional variation between different NMR solution-state probes is in the number and position of the coils, which generally can be used to transmit and to receive. A singleresonance probe contains a single radiofrequency (RF) coil and only allows observation of one nuclear species at a time, limiting the type of NMR experiments that can be performed. Most modern probes contain two, but these are often tuned to have more than one resonance (or ''channel"), each optimised to monitor a different nucleus. The nuclei monitored using the inner coil can be detected with enhanced sensitivity compared to the nuclei monitored using the outer coil. Although each channel can only be tuned to one class of nucleus ( 1 H, 13 C, 19 F etc.) at a time, on some spectrometers it is, in principle, possible to conduct time-shared heteronuclear double resonance on the same coil [7].The greatest functional variation between different NMR solution-state probes is in the number and position of the coils, which generally can be used to transmit and to receive.

        <p>The detection sensitivity of a given experiment will also vary between spectrometers. Higher field magnets afford a greater signal intensity and resolution for the same volume of sample. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) can also be increased by reducing thermal noise through the use of cryogenically-cooled (He, or N 2 ) RF coils and preamplifiers. Specialised probes for use with smaller diameter NMR tubes than the standard 5 mm probe are available, and these lead to higher sensitivity per unit mass of sample [11]. The use of para-hydrogen (p-H 2 ) techniques, though beyond the capacities of most routine NMR facilities, can be a very effective tool to increase NMR sensitivity in some cases, see Section 2.4.5 below, including selective enhancement of selected peaks [12][13][14].The detection sensitivity of a given experiment will also vary between spectrometers.

        <p>2.1.1.1. Pre-acquisition and thermal equilibration. Several steps must be taken between sample insertion into the probe and spectrum acquisition. Magnetic field stability can be ensured by locking to a relevant signal frequency, most commonly to deuterium. The probe must be tuned to the frequency of the measured nucleus, matching the transmitter and preamplifier impedances with that of the probe, and the magnetic field homogenised across the sample ('shimming') [3,5,7].2.1.1.1.

        <p>A general workflow is: prepare sample, insert into spectrometer, allow sample to equilibrate at temperature, set acquisition parameters, tune probe, lock, shim, collect data. Many or all of these steps can be performed automatically. The sample temperature is usually controlled by changing the temperature of gas ('VT gas' -usually dry air or nitrogen) passing through the probe and past the sample, and on many spectrometers this can be adjusted across a wide range of temperatures. The temperature control of reactions conducted in NMR tubes within the probe is usually sufficiently stable (within ±0.5 °C) unless rapid exothermic or endothermic processes are being investigated [15]. Five main parameters govern the rate and thus time taken for thermal equilibration after insertion of the sample into the probe: (i) the initial temperature difference (DT 0 ) between the sample and the probe; (ii) the flow-rate of the VT gas passing through the probe; (iii) the heat capacity of the sample, primarily dependent on the identity and volume of the solvent; (iv) the NMR tube material and dimensions, and heat flux attainable through the tube walls; and (v) the specific design and thermostatic efficiency of the probe.A general workflow is: prepare sample, insert into spectrometer, allow sample to equilibrate at temperature, set acquisition parameters, tune probe, lock, shim, collect data.

        <p>For example, with the NMR cryoprobe employed in the work of the authors, it takes less than about two minutes for stabilisation (DT &lt; 0.5 °C) of a typical 0.6 mL organic solvent sample in a standard 5 mm borosilicate NMR tube (see red line in Fig. 1).For example, with the NMR cryoprobe employed in the work of the authors, it takes less than about two minutes for stabilisation (DT &lt; 0.5 °C) of a typical 0.6 mL organic solvent sample in a standard 5 mm borosilicate NMR tube (see red line in Fig. 1).</p>
        <p>When rapid thermal equilibration prior to acquisition is required, it is advisable to estimate the thermostatic efficiency of the probe employed, using the solvent for the reaction to be analysed, Fig. 1. It is also advantageous to pre-heat or cool the sample prior to insertion, and to pre-shim using a dummy sample (Section 2.2.1.2.1) at the required temperature. For experiments where complete temperature stabilisation is required, for example to minimise convection in DOSY measurements, samples should be left to equilibrate for tens of minutes.When rapid thermal equilibration prior to acquisition is required, it is advisable to estimate the thermostatic efficiency of the probe employed, using the solvent for the reaction to be analysed, Fig. 1.

        <p>When performed with appropriate delays, standard pulseacquire NMR sequences can be inherently quantitative, with the area of each peak directly proportional to the concentration and number of nuclei. Thus, for a series of spectra generated by in situ monitoring of a chemical reaction, if the concentration of one species in one spectrum is known (typically the initial concentration, in the first spectrum), it is possible to calculate the concentration of all species in the dataset. Whilst the quantitative nature of NMR is one of the key benefits of the technique, it remains common practice to use an internal standard to eliminate any instrumental variability when accurate concentrations are required [3,[16][17][18]. The internal standard nullifies the effects of any differences in absolute integral between the individual spectra that will make up the kinetic dataset; it can also be used to normalise the chemical shift axis. Thus, in contrast to routine internal reference compounds expressly used for normalising chemical shift, e.g. tetramethylsilane (b.p. 26 °C), an internal standard for quantification must be (i) relatively non-volatile (to avoid loss during the reaction), (ii) have a similar longitudinal relaxation rate (see Section 3.2) to the species being monitored (to avoid the need to increase relaxation delays) [16,18,19], (iii) have a well-resolved peak, or peaks, and (iv) be fully soluble in the reaction medium throughout the reaction evolution.When performed with appropriate delays, standard pulseacquire NMR sequences can be inherently quantitative, with the area of each peak directly proportional to the concentration and number of nuclei.

        <p>Most importantly, the internal standard must be inert under the reaction conditions -not just towards the species present in the NMR tube (or the surface of the tube itself), but also to any conditions applied externally such as heat or light. In addition to being of constant concentration, the internal standard is ideally also of known concentration, in order to allow calculations of absolute, rather than merely relative, concentrations. For the concentration of the standard to be known, it must also be of known purity. The corresponding concentration of any species in solution can then be accurately calculated (see Section 3.4). To minimise errors in establishing the concentration of the internal standard, it is preferable to prepare it as a solution in the reaction solvent. This stock solution can also be used to dissolve all components, over multiple reactions. Alternatively, a stock solution containing the internal standard and one or more of the reaction components can be prepared. The standard should be present in the reaction at a concentration that gives an NMR signal intensity at least comparable to one of the limiting reagents, in order to minimize errors when analysing relative integrations. Selecting a suitable internal standard is not always a trivial matter. Table 1 provides a small selection of internal standards that we have recently employed.Most importantly, the internal standard must be inert under the reaction conditions -not just towards the species present in the NMR tube (or the surface of the tube itself), but also to any conditions applied externally such as heat or light.

        <p>If a suitable internal standard cannot be found, there are two alternative approaches. One is to use an external standard [16], within the NMR tube but physically separated from the reaction solution, by use of a sealed capillary tube or coaxial insert. While many of the requirements for an internal standard still apply, that of inertness to the reaction conditions is circumvented by physical separation. This separation may also cause different instrument responses between the standard and the compounds to be measured, making the external standard a less common method for quantification in reaction monitoring. The second approach is to use an electronic reference which relies on a digital reference peak [16,19]. After calibration, the digital reference signal can be added to the experimentally acquired spectrum and used analogously to a physical standard. The advantage of this method is that nothing Fig. 1.

The lines are calculated using the empirical relationship: T sample % T probe -DT 0 e -kt , where t is the time after insertion, DT 0 is the initial temperature difference between the sample (21 °C) and the probe (x-axis, T probe ), and k is a heat-transfer rate constant, specific to the solvent, sample volume, NMR tube, VT gas flow rate, and probe. The k values were estimated from a series of heating and cooling curves, in which T sample was measured at 5 s intervals using a Pt-100 sensor immersed in the specified solvent in the NMR tube (0.60 mL in 5 mm tube, 0.4 mm wall thickness; 0.22 mL in 3 mm tube, 0.3 mm wall thickness) prior to insertion.

The purple and yellow curves show the impact of sample volume and gas flow rate.If a suitable internal standard cannot be found, there are two alternative approaches. One is to use an external standard [16], within the NMR tube but physically separated from the reaction solution, by use of a sealed capillary tube or coaxial insert. While many of the requirements for an internal standard still apply, that of inertness to the reaction conditions is circumvented by physical separation. This separation may also cause different instrument responses between the standard and the compounds to be measured, making the external standard a less common method for quantification in reaction monitoring.

        <p>Almost all NMR experiments are conducted within NMR tubes. Routine NMR tubes are thin-walled, made of borosilicate glass, and are available in a range of different sizes and outer diameters (1-10 mm). The selection of the diameter depends primarily on the NMR probe, Section 2.1.1. NMR tubes with an outer diameter (O. D.) of 5 mm (Fig. 2) are the most common, although 3 mm tubes can also be used in 5 mm NMR probes.Almost all NMR experiments are conducted within NMR tubes.

        <p>For addition of solids to NMR tubes we normally employ a short disposable Pasteur pipette. This can be placed horizontally on a simple V-shaped support, e.g. the mouth of a small empty beaker, placed on a microbalance. Using a micro-spatula, the solid is then carefully added into the wider bore of the pipette until the desired weight is measured. Then, after inserting the narrow bore end of the pipette into the tip of the open NMR tube, simply raising the pipette vertically usually transfers the solid into the tube. If need be, a sharp tap on the side of the pipette, or rinsing through with solvent, can be employed to ensure complete transfer. NMR tubes are generally capped with Kel-F caps, however silicone or rubber septum caps can be employed for air-sensitive reactions as they allow for the injection of sample through a self-sealing lid (see Section 2.2.1.2.1) [20,21]. It should also be noted that sample contamination can arise from inadvertent extraction of the plasticiser present in some NMR tube caps by common organic solvents. Some variation in the configuration of the tubes exists for different purposes. For example, J Young valve NMR tubes have a screw fitting in the glass designed to accommodate a PTFE compression-seal plunger (Fig. 2c). With this system, samples highly sensitive to oxygen and moisture can be prepared, and tubes can be kept connected to a Schlenk line if needed. Shigemi tubes minimise the amount of sample required: the bottom section is made of solid glass, and an insert (Fig. 2f), again of solid glass, is then placed above the sample. This ensures that most of the sample is in the detection region of the radiofrequency coil. The solid glass sections are designed to match the magnetic susceptibility of the particular solvent being used. This allows improved shimming of the magnetic field and thus improved spectral resolution [20,21]. When running chemical reactions in NMR tubes one has to take into account that the glass surface may react with the components of the sample. As an example, borosilicate and quartz glass react with high concentrations of fluoride or hydroxide anions [22]. These features may not only affect the reaction, but also permanently damage the NMR tube; in such cases, inserts made of perfluorinated polymers can be used to avoid direct contact between the glass and the solution [23].For addition of solids to NMR tubes we normally employ a short disposable Pasteur pipette.

        <p>Several reaction monitoring techniques also require the use of more specialised equipment such as inserts, capillary tubes, flow cells, connectors and so on (for more details see Section 2.4). Aside from the glassware, materials used in these types of equipment include polymers such as PTFE and PEEK. However, these materials are not always inert to the reaction conditions. For example, PEEK absorbs DMSO and MeOH and is incompatible with strongly acidic or corrosive oxidants such as bromine [34]. As reaction kinetics can change unpredictably through unplanned reactivity with the reaction vessel and other components used to assemble the reaction mixture (syringes, needles, septa, gasses, etc.), care must be taken to ensure the compatibility of all materials in the experimental set up.

        <p>Two crucial initial considerations when designing a mechanistic study using NMR are the sampling method, and access to the NMR spectrometer. There are a broad range of techniques available for sampling, allowing the majority of chemical reactions to be monitored, but although many studies have been reported which make use of these techniques, very few go into sufficient detail to allow the uninitiated to apply them [35][36][37][38][39][40].

        <p>There are two distinct categories of methods available to monitor and sample reactions: [39] ex situ, where the reaction is conducted outside the NMR tube, and in situ, where the reaction is conducted entirely within one NMR tube. In all cases, there is a time gap between reaction initiation (''t 0 ") and the acquisition of the first spectrum after the reaction has started. This gap is often referred to as the 'dead time'. The velocity of the reaction relative to the dead time is a key consideration in deciding what technique to apply.There are two distinct categories of methods available to monitor and sample reactions: [39] ex situ, where the reaction is conducted outside the NMR tube, and in situ, where the reaction is conducted entirely within one NMR tube.

        <p>2.2.1.1. Ex situ monitoring. In ex situ monitoring, the reaction is conducted exactly as it would be under standard laboratory conditions, with the exceptions that an internal standard is (usually) also added to the reaction, and that prior to reaction initiation an aliquot of the solution is taken out and set aside [36,39,41]. Once the reaction is initiated, small aliquots are taken from the bulk solution at various recorded time increments. Each aliquot is immediately quenched and set aside. The quenching technique used is very dependent on the specific reaction under investigation, but common methods include addition of acid, base, ligand, or water, etc., filtration of heterogeneous components, simple exposure to air, heat/cooling or UV light. Each aliquot can be then placed in its own NMR tube and diluted (if necessary), and NMR spectra can then be measured essentially at leisure (Fig. 3). It is worth noting that this technique is very reliant on the ability to completely stop the reaction upon exposure to the quenching agent. It is therefore advisable to test that such quenching is complete, for example by measuring samples again after a short time delay. If the samples are found to evolve slightly after quenching, the data can sometimes be corrected, after careful calibration, based on the time interval between adding the quenching agent and the NMR analysis.2.2.1.1.

        <p>A variant of this technique involves a series of two or more parallel reactions, each of which is quenched at a different time point. Although this adds a degree of uncertainty to the data (each reaction vessel must be kept under identical conditions over the course of the reaction), it can be useful in the case of slow reactions. For example, by setting up a pair of identical reactions, one started about 10 h after the other, one can 'interleave' data-sets to avoid gaps in the ex situ sampling data while the operator sleeps (Fig. 4).A variant of this technique involves a series of two or more parallel reactions, each of which is quenched at a different time point.

        <p>Ex situ sampling has several advantages: (i) it is compatible with almost any laboratory reaction, provided a suitable quenching agent can be found; (ii) it requires only minimal time access to the NMR spectrometer; (iii) it allows for detailed NMR experiments on the 'frozen' reaction aliquots; (iv) these 'frozen' aliquots can be further investigated using other analytical techniques; and (v) after gaining some experience, it is possible to conduct multiple kinetic experiments in parallel. However, the ex situ method is highly labour-intensive, increasingly so as the number of parallel reactions increases. The method also requires a sufficiently large reaction volume that repeated sampling does not perturb the reaction conditions. As each time point is individually quenched and measured in a separate vessel, ex situ monitoring is more prone to random measurement error than in situ techniques that employ a single tube, see for example the study of Carbery and Hintermair and co-workers [33]. Furthermore, the nature of reaction quenching means that transient intermediates are usually lost. Despite the limitations, ex situ monitoring remains a very powerful, but somewhat underutilised tool -possibly due to the amount of work required to generate a single kinetic profile.Ex situ sampling has several advantages: (i) it is compatible with almost any laboratory reaction, provided a suitable quenching agent can be found; (ii) it requires only minimal time access to the NMR spectrometer; (iii) it allows for detailed NMR experiments on the 'frozen' reaction aliquots; (iv) these 'frozen' aliquots can be further investigated using other analytical techniques; and (v) after gaining some experience, it is possible to conduct multiple kinetic experiments in parallel.

        <p>2.2.1.2. In situ monitoring. If sufficient access to an NMR spectrometer can be secured, reaction monitoring can be conducted by in situ techniques, where the reaction takes place entirely within the volume of the NMR tube or flow cell. There are some important differences in the implementation of chemical reactions within NMR tubes compared to ordinary laboratory 'benchtop' procedures. The most important distinction is mixing: without specialist techniques, reactions in NMR tubes cannot be stirred [40,42]. As much as is practically feasible, solutions and components should be pre-mixed prior to addition to the NMR tube. When additional components do need to be added individually direct to the tube, the tube should then be sealed with a cap, septum, or PTFE valve (Fig. 2), and the solution thoroughly mixed through a combination of inversion and vigorous horizontal shaking of the NMR tube along its length; we emphasise vigorous, as solutions in NMR tubes tend to move as a plug when only moderately agitated. Vortex mixers can also be useful in this regard, but should be used with care with fragile NMR tubes.2.2.1.2. In situ monitoring.

        <p>In the case of oxygen-or water-sensitive reactions and reagents, special care needs to be taken. Several excellent guides are available on this topic [43][44][45][46][47]. For NMR reaction monitoring, the reaction must be conducted using solvents (and liquid reagents) that Fig. 3. Schematic of the process of ex situ sampling for reaction monitoring. Y. Ben-Tal, P.J. Boaler, Harvey J.A. Dale et al. Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 129 (2022) have been rigorously dried and degassed, and it is advisable to conduct the monitoring in a J Young valve NMR tube [28]. If it proves necessary to add reagent to the tube, several options are available depending on the degree of sensitivity of the reaction. The atmosphere within an NMR tube remains relatively static, so for many reactions the process will not be noticeably altered if the cap is briefly removed to add a reagent and then rapidly replaced. For more sensitive reactions, reagents can be injected directly through a septum cap, or added via the J Young valve which is then immediately purged with inert gas. In the case of especially air-sensitive reactions, the tube should be opened within a glove box, additional reagents added, resealed, and taken out for mixing and monitoring. This operation can consume a considerable amount of time, and if required the solution in the sealed NMR tube can be frozen prior to transport back to the spectrometer and then rapidly thawed for analysis.In the case of oxygen-or water-sensitive reactions and reagents, special care needs to be taken.

        <p>2.2.1.2.1. Continuous in situ monitoring. In the continuous in situ procedure, the reaction takes place entirely within the NMR tube in the spectrometer probe, allowing for the monitoring of reactions over a period of minutes to hours, with very good control over the reaction temperature. Unless one has exclusive access to a spectrometer, the technique is not suited to the monitoring of reactions that take hours to days. The first stage in the process is to assemble as many of the reaction components as it is possible to combine in solution without initiating the reaction, or side reactions, (in most cases all but one reagent) in an NMR tube. The solution volume should ideally be as close to the final volume as possible; and the volume should be such that there is a sufficient portion above the active volume of the probe to avoid the need to change shim settings later. For standard 5 mm O.D. NMR tubes, the required total volume is usually about 600 mL. The tube is then inserted into the probe of the spectrometer, the pre-acquisition operations (Section 2.1.1.1) are performed, and a spectrum is acquired. This initial spectrum provides the 't = 0' datapoint. The NMR tube is then removed from the spectrometer and the final reagent added. The tube is sealed, the contents rapidly mixed (see above) and the tube reinserted into the spectrometer (Fig. 5a) [26,28,48].2.2.1.2.1. Continuous in situ monitoring.

        <p>As the spectrometer has just been tuned, matched and shimmed on the t = 0 sample, and provided there is not a significant change in the contents, the first spectrum can usually be acquired without delay; i.e. avoiding many of the pre-acquisition operations such as matching, tuning, and shimming (Section 2.1.1.1). The tube remains in the NMR probe until the reaction proceeds to the desired extent of completion. Most spectrometers can be programmed to automatically acquire a series of spectra at defined intervals. In cases where addition of the final component(s) results in a significant change in the sample (e.g. volume, density, ionic strength, or homogeneity), a 'dummy sample' can be used for the pre-acquisition operations (Section 2.1.1.1). The dummy sample is prepared using an identical NMR tube, containing an identical volume of solution to the reaction to be studied, with as similar as possible a composition to the reaction mixture, but chemically inert. It is often possible to use an identical reaction that has been initiated earlier as the dummy sample [28]. 2.2.1.2.2. Interrupted in situ monitoring. This process is similar to continuous in situ monitoring, but employs the typical automation set up found in most research NMR facilities; that is, the spectrometer automatically loads, locks, tunes, matches and shims the sample, before measuring a spectrum and then returning the tube to the auto-sampler system. The first step of this protocol, Fig. 5b, is identical to continuous in situ monitoring, up to the point that the final components are mixed into the tube and returned to the spectrometer. The final components are added to the tube, the time recorded, and the tube returned to the auto-sampler. This time, rather than programming the spectrometer to take a series of spectra without re-shimming the sample each time, the spectrom-eter is commanded to automatically insert the sample, conduct all the necessary preliminaries, take a spectrum, and then eject the sample, repeating this cycle a set number of times at pre-set intervals; most standard NMR control software has easy-to-use preexisting options for this. This has the major advantage that it allows for other samples to be run on the same spectrometer between kinetics time points; however, this means that the time points by necessity must be much further apart than those that can be achieved with continuous in situ monitoring [26]. Additionally, as the sample is continuously changing position from within to outside of the probe and vice versa, the temperature of the reaction cannot be accurately controlled, although this can be partially overcome by manually removing the sample and storing in a thermostat bath between time points [24].As the spectrometer has just been tuned, matched and shimmed on the t = 0 sample, and provided there is not a significant change in the contents, the first spectrum can usually be acquired without delay; i.e. avoiding many of the pre-acquisition operations such as matching, tuning, and shimming (Section 2.1.1.1).

This has the major advantage that it allows for other samples to be run on the same spectrometer between kinetics time points; however, this means that the time points by necessity must be much further apart than those that can be achieved with continuous in situ monitoring [26]. Additionally, as the sample is continuously changing position from within to outside of the probe and vice versa, the temperature of the reaction cannot be accurately controlled, although this can be partially overcome by manually removing the sample and storing in a thermostat bath between time points [24].</p>
        <p>2.2.1.2.3. In situ monitoring by periodic activation. The final, and least common, methodology we term 'periodic activation in situ monitoring'. This is a technique that is only applicable in the case of reactions where the rate of reaction can be controlled through external stimuli [49]. Examples of such stimuli are light, heat and microwave irradiation. It is important to note that, despite the use of an external stimulus, this is not an ex situ technique as the entire reaction is conducted within a single NMR tube. If the reaction only proceeds at a significant rate in the presence of the stimulus, is possible to interrupt the reaction at any point by removing the stimulus, measure a spectrum, and then to restart the reaction by reapplication of the stimulus. This is notably distinct from quenching, which irreversibly stops the reaction. Thus, after acquiring an initial NMR spectrum of the solution, it is removed from the spectrometer and then subjected to the external stimulus for a set amount of time (Fig. 5c). After this time the stimulus is removed (for example the tube is rapidly cooled to room temperature, or placed in the dark) and an NMR spectrum can be taken at leisure. The sample is then ejected from the spectrometer, and subjected to the external stimulus, and the cycle repeated until the reaction reaches the desired extent of completion. Care must be taken that there is no reaction, or other undesired process, in the absence of the stimulus, and control experiments should be conducted to establish this. Periodic in situ reaction monitoring can be a powerful tool, since the NMR spectroscopy can be conducted at leisure -allowing high S/N and more complex NMR experiments to be conducted. Another important consideration is that the NMR spectrum is being measured in the absence of the reaction stimulus, and the sample is thus under different conditions to those that apply when the reaction is proceeding. As such, it can sometimes be possible to analyse and characterise intermediates that would be short-lived under the reaction conditions; see Case Study 14 for an example of this.2.2.1.2.3.

        <p>There is a wide choice of standard techniques that can be employed for reaction monitoring by NMR, as well as some more advanced and specialised methods that are discussed in Section 2.4. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and a number of considerations must be taken into account when choosing a suitable sampling method to be used, as summarised in the flowchart in Fig. 6.There is a wide choice of standard techniques that can be employed for reaction monitoring by NMR, as well as some more advanced and specialised methods that are discussed in Section 2.4.

        <p>The first factor to consider is 'NMR tube compatibility'. Not every reaction can be conducted within an NMR tube. The presence of a heterogeneous component in the reaction medium causes two problems. Firstly the volume within a static (or spinning) NMR tube undergoes very poor vertical (z-axis) mixing, leading to stagnancy and chemical gradients. Secondly, if the heterogeneous component is a solid or suspension, this can reduce, sometimes severely, the line shape and spectral resolution [3,7]. Similarly, reactions that require the presence of an aerobic oxidant are often unable to proceed efficiently due to the limited headspace above the reaction volume, and the poor vertical (z-axis) gaseous mixing in the headspace. Reactions that require the addition of gaseous reagents are technically challenging, with gas bubbles causing S/ N reductions due to inhomogeneity and decreased amount of sample in the active volume. Reactions that generate gas can also be unsuitable due to pressure build-up in a sealed NMR tube and potential for damage to the probe. If such reactions can be quenched, then they can still be monitored by ex situ sampling; otherwise, a more specialised technique, such as continuous flow NMR (discussed in Section 2.4.3), or the use of high-pressure NMR tubes, is required. If the reaction can be conducted in situ, the next factor to consider is whether the reaction can be controlled by external stimuli.The first factor to consider is 'NMR tube compatibility'.

        <p>In many cases a reaction that can be monitored by periodic activation can also be monitored with other specialised or nonspecialised techniques. For example, photochemical reactions can be monitored either by periodic activation or by continuous in situ illumination NMR spectroscopy (see Section 2.4.2.2), or both. Another major factor to consider is temperature. In the case of reactions conducted ex situ the usual considerations for any laboratory reaction apply. However, several more are present in the case of reactions conducted within NMR tubes. In addition to factors such as solvent freezing and boiling points, the possible temperature ranges the specific spectrometer used can operate in must be considered. In the case of reactions conducted at extreme temperatures the practicality of NMR tube assembly must also be considered. Thus, even if the spectrometer probe is capable of measuring samples at cryogenic temperatures, without the use of specialised equipment it is challenging to keep a sample in an NMR tube cold whilst adding it to and removing it from the probe, or whilst adding additional reagents.In many cases a reaction that can be monitored by periodic activation can also be monitored with other specialised or nonspecialised techniques.

        <p>For interrupted monitoring employing automatic sample changers, the temperature of the sample when it is outside of the probe will depend on the ambient temperature in the NMR instrument room or sample changer thermostat. For manual interrupted monitoring, samples can be placed in thermostatic heating or cooling baths when outside the probe. Within the probe, however, the temperature can often be very well controlled in comparison to a benchtop laboratory reaction, and spectroscopic methods such as the NMR methanol thermometer can be used to measure sample temperature with a reasonable degree of accuracy [50].For interrupted monitoring employing automatic sample changers, the temperature of the sample when it is outside of the probe will depend on the ambient temperature in the NMR instrument room or sample changer thermostat.

        <p>The final, and arguably most critical, consideration when choosing a sampling technique is timescale. While technically either continuous or interrupted in situ monitoring is possible for long reactions, in the interests of conserving valuable instrument time, interrupted in situ monitoring is often preferred if possible. However, for reactions shorter than a few hours, continuous monitoring is required to achieve useful data density. As reactions become faster, the limit of what can be easily achieved even by continuous in situ monitoring by conventional means is reached. By changing factors such as catalyst loading, concentration, and temperature, the timescale of a reaction can sometimes be adjusted to facilitate NMR analysis by simple conventional sampling methods. However, for very fast reactions (lifetimes shorter than a few minutes) specialised techniques such as rapid-injection or stopped-flow NMR (Section 2.4.4) must be used.The final, and arguably most critical, consideration when choosing a sampling technique is timescale.

        <p>After selecting the sampling method, a number of other factors must be considered prior to embarking upon kinetic measurement. There is usually little choice of which reagents can be employed, as these are specific to the process being studied, but if there are options, low reactivity and ease of handling should be considered: the NMR laboratory is usually far less well equipped for chemical manipulation than the standard wet chemical research laboratory. Most importantly however, one must select which nucleus/nuclei will be used to monitor the reaction, and what specific NMR parameters will be employed, e.g. pulse sequence, number of scans, acquisition time, or relaxation delay.After selecting the sampling method, a number of other factors must be considered prior to embarking upon kinetic measurement.

        <p>Selection of components and conditions 2.3.1.1. Choice of substrate. Mechanistic studies do not usually apply to just a single transformation, but rather to a class of transformations, often with a large range of viable substrates. However, to constrain an NMR-based investigation to a reasonable timescale, and to more directly isolate the process from other variables, it is normal practise to select just one or a few examples for detailed study. This selection must occur at a very early step in the mechanistic study, and should thus be made carefully to avoid having to revise the selection later and repeat a large number of measurements. The examples should be representative of a typical reaction of the class being studied. The chemicals employed will ideally be safe, stable, non-volatile, soluble in the desired solvent system (Section 2.3.1.3) and readily available in reasonable quantities. It is also pertinent to choose substrates containing functional groups which contain nuclei favourable for NMR monitoring. While it is good to study a system that primarily undergoes the desired reaction (i.e. proceeds to high conversion with reasonable yield), the presence and behaviour of side reactions can often also provide much insight into the system, and one or more substrates displaying such behaviour should be included [29].Selection of components and conditions 2.3.1.1.

        <p>In principle, all nuclei with non-zero spin quantum number are NMR active. It is common that the studied system contains more than one NMR-active nucleus which could be used to monitor the reaction. However, not all of these nuclei will be suitable for the timescale of the studied reaction. There are at least four factors which need to be considered: sensitivity, relaxation time, chemical shift range, and the complexity of the spectrum. As one limitation of NMR spectroscopy can be its intrinsically low sensitivity, the first thing to be considered is the sensitivity of the nuclei available to be studied. Nuclei with low sensitivity result in lower signal-to-noise ratios, and at the limit of sensitivity the signal becomes hidden in the noise [51]. In order to achieve suitable S/N, nuclei with high natural abundance and gyromagnetic ratio are preferable. The properties of selected nuclei are shown in Table 2; 1 H has the highest sensitivity, closely followed by 19 F.In principle, all nuclei with non-zero spin quantum number are NMR active.

        <p>Although lowering the temperature of the probe or increasing the magnetic field can improve the S/N, a more practical way is to increase the number of scans or to use a more concentrated sample. The former can only be used when monitoring a slow reaction, because of the longer time required to acquire a spectrum. Ideally, there should be as little as possible change in the chemical state of the sample between the start and end of the measurement of a single time point. Similarly, it is often impractical to increase sample concentration, particularly if one wants to investigate a reaction at a series of concentrations. In the cases of nuclei with low natural abundance (e.g. in the cases of 2 H or 13 C) isotopic enrichment (see Section 5) can be employed to improve the sensitivity [52,53].Although lowering the temperature of the probe or increasing the magnetic field can improve the S/N, a more practical way is to increase the number of scans or to use a more concentrated sample.

        <p>The second factor that needs to be considered is the relaxation time. There are two types of relaxation: spin-lattice relaxation (T 1 ) and spin-spin relaxation (T 2 ), see Section 3. The practical implications of T 1 relate to signal intensity and hence effective quantitation, and as a general rule a shorter T 1 is desirable. In contrast, the effect of T 2 is to determine the linewidth of the signal -a longer T 2 corresponds to a sharper line, and so typically a longer T 2 is preferred. There are many relaxation mechanisms [4], and the relaxation rates of the same type of nucleus in different compounds can be substantially different, For example, the T 1 values for PPh 3 and OPPh 3 (both 0.1 M in 9:1 THF/H 2 O, at 27 °C) are 16.0 s and 3.6 s respectively [54]. In addition, as a general rule nuclei with spin = 1/2 have signals with a narrower line than those from quadrupolar nuclei (spin &gt; 1/2; some common examples include 11 B, 14 peak overlap, making them less suitable for reaction monitoring, although with care they can be used. Hydrogen and carbon are ubiquitous in organic chemistry, and 1 H/ 13 C NMR spectroscopy can provide a large amount of structural information about the system being studied. However, as the number of species present in one solution (the starting materials, product, side products and any observed intermediates) increases, the 1 H and 13 C spectra of the monitored system become increasingly complex. In such cases, peak overlap can be so severe that discriminating between peaks, and hence reaction monitoring, becomes unfeasible.The second factor that needs to be considered is the relaxation time.

        <p>Often the observation of X-nuclei (i.e. nuclei other than 1 H) can greatly simplify the spectrum and provide some extra insights into the reaction. Additionally, the use of nuclei other than 1 H can eliminate the need for solvent peak suppression techniques or use of deuteriated solvent (see also Section 2.3.1.3). Among the Xnuclei, 19 F is a particularly good candidate: it has spin = 1/2, 100% natural abundance, a sensitivity close to 1 H, and a large chemical shift range [55]. Many reactions result in only subtle changes in the structures of the reactants, intermediates and products. Nuclei with larger chemical shift ranges are thus more suited to reaction monitoring because their chemical shifts, d, are more sensitive to changes in the chemical environment, making 19 F labelling (see Section 2.3.3.1) a useful strategy for reaction monitoring. In general, 19 F has a T 1 similar to 1 H, meaning that with suitable parameters quantitative NMR spectra of 19 F can be obtained in a comparable time. 31 P also has spin = 1/2, a 100% natural abundance, and a large chemical shift range, but it has lower sensitivity than e.g. 1 H or 19 F. Hence a 31 P NMR experiment usually requires a longer time, with a longer delay between scans, and more scans are required for acceptable S/N. Nonetheless, it remains a powerful technique, for example in kinetic studies of reactions catalysed by metal-phosphine complexes [56,57].Often the observation of X-nuclei (i.e. nuclei other than 1 H) can greatly simplify the spectrum and provide some extra insights into the reaction.

        <p>Finally, extra precautions are required for 10 B, 11 B, 27 Al or 29 Si NMR spectroscopy. Ordinary NMR tubes are made of borosilicate glass, and most NMR probes also contains glass. The glass gives rise to broad background peaks that can affect the measurement. The signals from the tube can be eliminated by using special tubes made of other materials, as discussed in Section 2.1.1. Alternatively, one can take a reference blank spectrum prior to experiment, and subtract it during processing. However, this procedure is time-consuming, and the resultant spectrum may not be accurate enough for quantitative analysis.Finally, extra precautions are required for 10 B, 11 B, 27 Al or 29 Si NMR spectroscopy.

        <p>2.3.1.3. Choice of solvent. Many of the factors to be considered when choosing a suitable solvent for a particular experiment are the same as those for the equivalent laboratory reaction. It is essential that all reactants, intermediates and products are soluble, so that there is no precipitation during the course of experiment which will affect kinetics, quantitation and the resolution of the spectra. It is also important to consider the chemical properties of the solvent. Chloroform is rarely used in laboratory chemistry, but frequently employed as a solvent for NMR. On exposure to air and light, or heat, chloroform slowly degrades to HCl and toxic phosgene [58]. The presence of stabilisers that decompose the phosgene leads to further accumulation of HCl, and potentially the decomposition of acid-sensitive analytes. Furthermore, ethereal solvents, such as THF, undergo autoxidation to form peroxides, which in addition to being a safety hazard can also affect the mechanism and kinetics of the reaction being monitored [25,59].2.3.1.3.

        <p>Cost might be another factor to consider, especially if the experiment requires large amounts of solvent, such as in the case of a flow system. The price of some deuteriated solvents is very high, and many common laboratory solvents are not available in deuteriated form. Although deuteriated solvents are routinely used for preparation of NMR samples, their use is not essential for NMR experiments, and with appropriate solvent suppression, non-deuteriated solvents can also be used for 1 H NMR spectroscopy [62,63]. There are many solvent suppression methods, each of which has different advantages and disadvantages [64]. Reactions where the solvent plays a role may also be subject to solvent isotope effects, usually by exchange of protons with the analyte, a kinetic aspect that can be valuably probed using defined mixtures of the deuteriated and non-deuteriated solvent.Cost might be another factor to consider, especially if the experiment requires large amounts of solvent, such as in the case of a flow system.

        <p>One advantage of using deuteriated solvent is that it provides a convenient lock reference. It is crucial that NMR spectrometers maintain a stable magnetic field strength during an experiment, because fluctuations in magnetic field strength will cause shifts in signals and a loss in resolution. The lock system regulates the field strength by monitoring the dispersive-mode signal of the solvent deuterium resonance [51]. In principle, other nuclei can also be used (e.g. 1 H, 19 F) [65], but deuterium is the most convenient one, and most spectrometers are set up to use it by default. For samples which contain no lock nuclei, a co-axial insert or capillary insert containing deuteriated solvent can be used to provide an external lock (Fig. 7) [19].One advantage of using deuteriated solvent is that it provides a convenient lock reference.

        <p>Spectra can also be recorded in unlocked mode. For experiments with short single spectrum acquisition time (e.g. up to several minutes), using the unlocked mode is completely harmless as the change in magnetic field strength over this period is tiny, and will have a negligible effect on the resultant spectrum; the exact time limit depends on the drift rate of the magnet. The effect of drift is more problematic for spectra with longer acquisition times. For NMR experiments which take a long time due to sensitivity considerations, the acquisition can be subdivided into shorter blocks where the field drift is negligible. After Fourier transforming and manual frequency referencing, the frequency domain spectra may then be added to produce the final spectrum corrected for drift [51]. The deuterium signal is often used for field homogeneity (shimming), so alternative approaches are required to shim a nondeuteriated sample; Hoye et al. provide a practical and detailed guide [62].Spectra can also be recorded in unlocked mode.

        <p>For 1 H NMR spectroscopy, another advantage of using a deuteriated solvent is that it strongly attenuates the solvent signal. An NMR sample typically contains hundreds to thousands of times more solvent than analyte. The presence of a large solvent peak can mask the peak of interest, and lead to distortion of spectra if the concentration difference between solvent and analyte is too large [64]. For a dilute sample, even with a 99%-deuteriated solvent the residual solvent peak can still be large. Thus, it is advisable to consider the chemical shift of the solvent to avoid peak overlap; a guide to the 1 H and 13 C NMR chemical shifts for common solvents is available [66]. Deuteriated solvents, especially D 2 O and CD 3 OD, can cause loss of signal of labile protons due to H/D exchange.For 1 H NMR spectroscopy, another advantage of using a deuteriated solvent is that it strongly attenuates the solvent signal.

        <p>Chemical shifts can vary significantly between different solvents. The extent to which the chemical shifts change and the direction of change, can vary substantially between different compounds. Changes can also occur in other components in a mixture. For example the chemical shift of water ranges from 0.40 ppm in C 6 D 6 to 4.87 ppm in CD 3 OD. [66,67] In cases where reaction monitoring is affected by signal overlap, it can sometimes be beneficial to change the solvent, or add a co-solvent; however the potential for this to change the mechanism should be borne in mind.Chemical shifts can vary significantly between different solvents.

        <p>Prior to acquiring a series of individual NMR spectra at varying time points as the reaction progresses for kinetic analysis, several acquisition parameters such as number of scans, acquisition time, and relaxation delay must also be considered. Spectral sensitivity is proportional to the square root of the number of scans: increasing number of scans will increase sensitivity, but at the expense of increasing the time taken to acquire a single spectrum. This in turn reduces the data density in the final temporal concentration dataset, i.e. the number of specified time-points during the reaction for which the concentrations of various species are determined. This is especially problematic for fast reactions. The acquisition time and relaxation delay are both related to the T 1 relaxation times of the species being studied. Thus, if one or more of the species has a long T 1 , it will not fully recover magnetisation prior to application of the next RF pulse, leading to unreliable quantitation. Details of how to ensure quantitative NMR analyses can be found in reviews by Roy and Bharti [19], and by Larive and co-workers [53]. 19 F labelling. For kinetic studies, one should aim to determine the concentration of as many of the reaction components as feasible or convenient for each time point. A useful strategy for this is 19 F labelling [55], and we have developed this extensively over the last decade using p-F-C 6 H 4 . 19 F labelling is usually effected by using a reagent or reactant containing a -F, -CF 2 -or -CF 3 group (commercially available or synthesised in-house) and monitoring the reaction by 19 F NMR spectroscopy. By strategic placement of the 19 F label, the process of interest can often be monitored with very little influence of the label on the kinetics or selectivity, although control reactions should be made to confirm that this is the case. The use of 19 F labelling is advantageous for a number of reasons [68]. As discussed previously, 19 F has an intrinsically high sensitivity, and as such can be used for monitoring fast reactions, even with just single-scan spectra. Additionally, as the chemical shift of fluorine is very sensitive to its environment, the 19 F label does not need to be very close to the reactive centre. This prevents a significant influence of the label on the reaction of interest, while often still allowing for the ready distinction between different reaction components, without peak overlap. However, full assignment of signals can be difficult because the changes in chemical shift can be small or negligible for structurally-similar compounds. Moreover, as small changes in chemical shift can be caused by differences in sample temperature, concentration or composition, the use of literature chemical shift values is often not sufficient for reliable assignments. If feasible, 'spike-in' experiments using independently prepared reference materials are recommended.Prior to acquiring a series of individual NMR spectra at varying time points as the reaction progresses for kinetic analysis, several acquisition parameters such as number of scans, acquisition time, and relaxation delay must also be considered.

        <p>In cases where the direct determination of the concentration of the compound of interest is impossible (for example, due to serious peak overlap, or the lack of an NMR-active nucleus), an indirect approach can be used. With some insights into the mechanism and/or stoichiometry of the reaction, the concentration of the compound of interest can be indirectly determined based on the concentrations of other compounds with determinable concentrations. For example, in the hydrolytic decomposition of an arylboronic acid (Ar-B(OH) 2 ), to generate the corresponding arene (Ar-H) plus B(OH) 3 (see Case Study 1), the arene concentration can be determined indirectly from the growth of the B(OH) 3 signal in the 11 B NMR spectrum. However, great care must be taken to ensure that the assumed correspondence is correct. In the latter example, B(OH) 3 can also be extracted from the borosilicate glass wall of the NMR tube and thus corrupt the analysis.In cases where the direct determination of the concentration of the compound of interest is impossible (for example, due to serious peak overlap, or the lack of an NMR-active nucleus), an indirect approach can be used.

        <p>Quenched-flow is an ex situ sampling method that uses flow chemistry to both initiate and then quench the reaction. Although a series of experiments are needed to build up the temporal profile, the technique benefits from the ability to make NMR measurements over any time period on the quenched, and thus 'timestable' sample. Using this method high S/N can be gained with low concentration samples, and multidimensional NMR methods can be applied, for reactions that occur in the millisecond to second time range [74][75][76]. In addition, it possesses the advantages of any other ex situ technique, e.g. the sample can additionally be analysed by other methods, e.g. IR, UV, HPLC [77,78].Quenched-flow is an ex situ sampling method that uses flow chemistry to both initiate and then quench the reaction.

        <p>The set-up generally consists of three syringes -two containing reactant solutions, one containing the quencher -and two efficient mixers (Fig. 8) [79]. The three syringes are simultaneously moved at a known velocity by the action of a drive plate, and the reaction is initiated by combination of the reactant solutions in the first mixing chamber. The solution containing the nascent reaction is then flowed through an 'ageing loop' into a second mixer where it reacts with the quencher, prior to removal of the sample from the 'collection loop' for analysis. Introduction of the quencher generates a stable solution, in which partial conversion of reactant(s) to product(s) has occurred. The quencher must quantitatively terminate the reaction being studied, on a time scale much faster than the reaction. It must also generate a solution containing at least one component that quantitatively reflects the evolution of the reaction at the time-point of quench (substrate, or derivative thereof, or product).The set-up generally consists of three syringes -two containing reactant solutions, one containing the quencher -and two efficient mixers (Fig. 8) [79].

        <p>There are three mechanisms by which the timing of the quench can be accurately controlled. The first is by changing the flow rate between runs, whilst ensuring that it is above the flow threshold for turbulent flow in the mixing chamber. The second is by varying the ageing loop volume: most equipment is provided with a series of aging loops. The third is by interrupting the flow; in other words temporarily leaving the reaction static in the ageing loop before beginning flow again to transport the 'aged' reaction to the quench point. All modes require large volumes of reactant solutions to generate a series of quenched samples with sufficient temporal data density. This aspect must therefore be considered when using expensive, hazardous, or precious chemicals.There are three mechanisms by which the timing of the quench can be accurately controlled.

Several metal-catalysed reactions require the use of gas reagents such as hydrogen [80,81], carbon monoxide [82,83] or ethylene under high pressures to proceed. In addition, some chemical processes can also exhibit pressuredependent kinetics, and the study of this can provide further mechanistic insight [84][85][86]. The use of high pressures (&gt;2 bar) is not compatible with standard NMR glass tubes. In these cases, monitoring the reactions within the spectrometer requires the use of specialised NMR tubes, pressure control systems, and efficient ways to effect proper mixing between the gas and the liquid phase [87][88][89][90][91][92].In situ monitoring of reactions requiring external stimuli 2.4.2.1.

        <p>The most common designs used to carry out chemical reactions involving gaseous reagents under high pressure involve thickwalled NMR tubes attached to an engineered gas inlet. These set-ups can be transported, and do not require modification of the NMR probe. As such, they have the advantage that they can be used in any spectrometer, with all the benefits of its associated properties (sensitivity, temperature control, and customisations). The tubes are commonly made of sapphire due to its robustness, chemical stability and non-magnetic properties, although quartz and zirconia tubes are also used. However, despite the resistance of sapphire to high pressures, the tubes are sensitive to vibration and should not be used with sonicators.The most common designs used to carry out chemical reactions involving gaseous reagents under high pressure involve thickwalled NMR tubes attached to an engineered gas inlet.

        <p>A particular design called the Wisconsin-High Pressure NMR Reactor (Wi-HP-NMRR) has attracted attention in the community since its appearance in 2015 [91]. This system has recently allowed the in operando NMR study of organometallic processes at pressures up to 70 bar [93][94][95][96]. The system has a titanium holder that couples to the tube, and delivers liquid, gas, and washing solvent. The reaction can therefore be fed with gas during the delays in the pulse sequences prior to excitation and acquisition, allowing efficient gas-liquid mixing and preventing the 'starvation' of the reaction. Additionally, the use of the liquid delivery system and wash unit makes it possible to conduct a series of batch reactions, washing the reactor between runs without taking it out from the spectrometer.A particular design called the Wisconsin-High Pressure NMR Reactor (Wi-HP-NMRR) has attracted attention in the community since its appearance in 2015 [91].

The use of in situ illumination devices is important both to study various photochemical processes (such as photocatalytic reactions and photoswitches), and for more NMR-focused applications such as photo-CIDNP (Chemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation) and sensitivity amplification by use of para-H 2 (briefly discussed in Section 2.4.5) [97]. The properties of the light source (wavelength, intensity, efficiency and width of emission band) must be known, as these will influence the reaction being monitored. In addition, during in situ illumination NMR the sample must be irradiated in a uniform manner, particularly in optically dense samples, to maximise the sensitivity of the experiment and minimise concentration gradients. In this context, several devices involving irradiation from the bottom, the side or the top have been explored and reviewed in the literature [98,99].2.4.2.2. In situ illumination NMR.

        <p>In general, systems that involve illumination from above or inside the sample have been widely adopted due both to their simplicity and to their versatility and lack of spectrometer customisation required. The in situ illumination-NMR set-up in Fig. 9, first reported in 2013 [100] has been the most extensively used to date, with a number of applications in the study of organic and organometallic reactions [101]. The set-up is based on the use of a co-axial insert containing a sand-blasted fibre-optic cable, connected to a light-emitting diode, inside an amber 5 mm NMR tube. This allows uniform irradiation of the solution while preventing external interference. The use of the light-emitting diode (LED) as illumination source allows for narrow emission bands, high emission efficiencies, and the coverage of a wide range of wavelengths (265-1100 nm). In addition, the device is controllable directly from the NMR console, which is useful for investigating the behaviour of the reaction under both continuous and pulsed irradiation, important for testing for the presence of 'dark' processes [102].In general, systems that involve illumination from above or inside the sample have been widely adopted due both to their simplicity and to their versatility and lack of spectrometer customisation required.

Moreover, although the individual Y. Ben-Tal, P.J. Boaler, Harvey J.A.

        <p>2.4.2.3. In situ Electrochemistry-NMR. The study of electrochemical reactions in situ may lead to the identification of important intermediates and the assessment of their structure, which is difficult by other sampling methods [104][105][106]. In addition to the advantages linked to monitoring the reaction by NMR, the use of electrochemistry means that it is also possible to measure the temporal evolution of the current, and electrochemical potential, and even simultaneously record a voltammogram [107]. However, precautions must be taken as the effect of a magnetic field in an electrochemical process is not innocent: the current density generated interacts with the magnetic field of the spectrometer to generate the so-called Lorentz force. As a result, the sample is stirred, which affects both the transport of electrolytes and the difference in potential between the solution and the electrode [108][109][110]. These are parameters of the utmost importance in reactions controlled by mass transport and charge transfer, respectively. To avoid drawing incorrect conclusions, it is highly advisable to assess whether this type of monitoring affects the kinetics and mechanism of the process, by comparison with a reaction outside the magnet. Similarly to the in situ illumination devices, electrochemical cells also involve the use of NMR tubes and inserts containing electrodes, and have also not been commercialised to date, and must therefore be built in-house [106,108,111,112]. As with all inhouse systems, they should be calibrated before use. For this purpose, the reduction of parabenzoquinone can be used as a test reaction. Contrary to the in situ illumination set-ups, in situ electrochemistry-NMR devices require radio-frequency filters (chokes) at the tops of the electrodes to attenuate the noise in both the NMR and electrochemical data caused by interference between the two components. In addition, the presence of the electrodes inside the NMR tube negatively influences the quality of the NMR spectra, leading to broadening of the signals and poorer signal to noise ratio. For this reason, the applicability of this technique has been restricted to simple reactions producing NMR signals with little or no overlap [113][114][115]. Different systems with different electrode configurations (wires, metal-coated thin-films, car-bon fibres) have been reported in the literature, and their properties, ease of fabrication and influence in the NMR spectra reviewed [112]. However, no particular device has yet been widely adopted, and a more accessible and practical set-up is yet to be developed.2.4.2.3. In situ Electrochemistry-NMR.

For smaller reaction volumes, microfluidic flow probes have been developed, and are ideal for monitoring biological reactions with limited sample availability [122][123][124][125]. The general advantages of on-line monitoring are better control of the reaction parameters (temperature, pressure and stirring), compatibility with different types of reactors and reaction mixtures, and the possibility of adding chemical agents without the need to stop data acquisition [8,126,127]. In addition, reactions can be simultaneously analysed by other methods [128][129][130] and the use of a flow system can facilitate the concatenation of NMR with other analytical tools such as UV-VIS, IR or HPLC [131,132].This has been made possible by the development of different flow cells and NMR probes compatible with both high-field and low-field spectrometers [116][117][118][119][120][121].

        <p>One of the parameters that influences the time-scale of the experiments to be monitored is the flow rate. Most systems do not employ a pre-polarisation reservoir, and thus the maximum flow rate will be limited by the nuclei with the longest T 1 present in the sample [133][134][135], although faster rates can be used if the effect of a flowing sample on the intensity of the signals is properly taken into account [39]. Thus, it is highly advisable to measure the T 1 relaxation times of all the nuclei to be monitored under static conditions, prior to carrying out monitoring under continuous flow conditions. Also, it is beneficial to check that appropriate NMR pulse flip angles and delays are being used while monitoring, as they may affect the signal intensity as well [39].One of the parameters that influences the time-scale of the experiments to be monitored is the flow rate.

        <p>Undesired results arising from flowing a sample through the spectrometer can include insufficient pre-magnetisation (i.e. the unequal spin population required for the RF-pulse-induced FID, see Section 2.1.1) and incomplete purging (flushing out) of the active volume [134]. Efficient pre-magnetisation requires slower flow, efficient purging requires faster flow. Insufficient premagnetisation arises when the sample does not interact long enough with the magnetic field prior to application of the RF pulse, and leads to reduced signal intensities. In addition, the different T 1 values of the species being measured will translate into incorrect measured relative signal intensities. Pre-magnetisation can be improved by extending the residence time of the sample in the magnetic field prior to the RF pulse, either by reducing the flow rate or by lengthening the system within the high field region of the magnet using pre-magnetisation loops/coils. Alternatively, if measurements are carried out at a constant flow rate and the identities of the components are known, a mathematical correction of the signals can be made using known T 1 values [39]. In contrast to routine (static) NMR samples, the volume to which the RFpulse has been applied and which is emitting the FID, is being 'purged' from the cell in the probe head in the continuous flow method. This flow-induced attenuation of the signal leads to a faster FID decay and thus broadening of the signals. Although the effects of flow in NMR monitoring have been extensively documented [134], their magnitude is dependent on the set-up being used (tubing, flow rate, spectrometer and NMR probe). Therefore, it is highly recommended that, when assembling a new flow-NMR set-up, the influence of the flow rate on the various effects discussed above be measured prior to the use of the system to acquire data. The major contributor to the broadening of the peaks can often be field inhomogeneity rather than the flow rate itself.Undesired results arising from flowing a sample through the spectrometer can include insufficient pre-magnetisation (i.e. the unequal spin population required for the RF-pulse-induced FID, see Section 2.1.1) and incomplete purging (flushing out) of the active volume [134].

        <p>The effective in situ monitoring of rapid non-equilibrium reactions (half-lives less than half a minute) requires either initiation by an external stimulus, e.g. a pulse of light, or assembly of the reaction from the different reactants inside the spectrometer. The main reason why these types of systems are only rarely used in reaction monitoring is that most such systems require bespoke probes, and spectrometer modifications. In all cases, the monitoring timeframe of these methods will be limited by their 'phenomenological dead time': the earliest time after initiating the reaction at which a pulse can be applied to acquire a satisfactory NMR spectrum. A number of processes contribute to this, including mixing, transport to the active volume, and cessation of any oscillations and pressure waves in the sample. The two techniques in this family that have been extensively used are rapid-injection (RI-NMR) and stopped-flow (SF-NMR).The effective in situ monitoring of rapid non-equilibrium reactions (half-lives less than half a minute) requires either initiation by an external stimulus, e.g. a pulse of light, or assembly of the reaction from the different reactants inside the spectrometer.

        <p>In RI-NMR the reaction is set up and analysed in a batch mode: one of the reactants is injected into an NMR tube that is already located in the bore of the magnet and contains the rest of the reaction components (Fig. 11) [136]. The injection is achieved either by using a mechanical stirrer, with an impeller that is subsequently retracted from the active volume, or by the impact of a fast-moving solution jet. With the former the dead times are 1-2 s, whereas in the latter they can be as short as 0.03 s [137][138][139]. Because the reagents added are already located in the tube and therefore in the full magnetic field, all of the nuclei are fully 'pre-magnetised' (see Section 2.4.3). A major advantage to RI-NMR is the ability to use a very wide range of reaction temperatures, and to be able to add further samples of reagent to an evolving reaction mixture. However, in contrast to SF-NMR techniques, see below, the whole RI-NMR system (sample, stirrer and injector assembly) has to be removed from the probe and a new tube of reactants prepared for each experiment. Moreover, only a single reactant solution can be injected into the tube [140]. In addition, the dead volume (defined as the volume from the external reservoir to the injector tip) can be large, imposing limitations when using precious samples [137].In RI-NMR the reaction is set up and analysed in a batch mode: one of the reactants is injected into an NMR tube that is already located in the bore of the magnet and contains the rest of the reaction components (Fig. 11) [136].

        <p>Using this technique the reaction is initiated under flow conditions within the probe but the subsequent analysis is carried out under static conditions. In a classical stopped-flow set-up the plungers on two syringes containing the reagents are simultaneously pushed to deliver the solutions at a high flow rate into a highly-efficient mixer located inside the magnet, thus initiating the reaction (Fig. 11a) [141,142]. Due to the high flow rate, the pre-magnetisation of the samples is mainly achieved by storing the reagent solutions in small reservoirs located immediately before the mixer and in close proximity to the magnet centre [143,144]. The solution obtained after mixing is delivered into the NMR flow tube, and significantly greater volume (e.g. Â3) is delivered than that required to fill the flow cell, in order to ensure complete 'push-out' of the previous contents by the fresh reaction mixture. The rapid flow continues until the wastestream causes the plunger of the 'stop syringe' to hit a physical barrier, a so-called 'hard stop', and in doing so activates a microswitch, which sends a trigger voltage to the spectrometer console. Prior to the hard stop, the reaction flow-cell contains a rapidly flowing, freshly-assembled reaction mixture, with reactant concentrations corresponding to a pseudo steady-state that has evolved during the short period of time between the reactants mixing and the reaction mixture leaving the reaction flow-cell. On rapid cessation of the flow, data acquisition can take place to monitor the decay from the initial pseudo steady-state condition.Using this technique the reaction is initiated under flow conditions within the probe but the subsequent analysis is carried out under static conditions.

        <p>In SF-NMR the phenomenological dead time strongly depends on the specific instrument design, but in general the technique is limited to reactions with half-lives greater than about 0.05 s, typically considerably greater [15,[142][143][144][145]. For relatively fast reactions (lifetimes of a few tens of seconds or lower), the number of FIDs that can be acquired during a single run of the reaction can be insufficient for satisfactory kinetic analysis. In such cases, a series of reactions can be conducted, with a precisely incremented delay between the trigger signal and the first FID in each reaction. The combined ('interleaved') dataset then affords substantially enhanced temporal resolution of the reaction kinetics [15]. For irreversible chemical evolution of a reaction during FID acquisition to significantly affect the spectral linewidths, intensities, and phase, the half-life of the reaction must usually be 0.01 s [145]. Such processes are faster than the dead times of current SF-NMR systems, and these phenomena do not (yet) need to be taken into consideration [145].In SF-NMR the phenomenological dead time strongly depends on the specific instrument design, but in general the technique is limited to reactions with half-lives greater than about 0.05 s, typically considerably greater [15,[142][143][144][145].

        <p>The classical stopped-flow set-up (Fig. 11a) has some practical limitations: the total reaction volume is limited by the volume of the stop syringe, and the reagent solutions can only be mixed in a fixed volumetric ratio, usually 1:1, due to the use of a single pushing plate. These limitations have been recently addressed by the development of a hardware-controlled three-syringe driver system (Fig. 11b) [15,29]. In this system the volumetric ratios between syringes can be programmed and the acquisition triggered after delivering the desired volume, using a 'soft-stop' system based on the resistance to flow in the overall circuit. This new design allows a systematic and precise evaluation of concentration-dependent reaction parameters, without the need to replace the syringes or take out the sample tube. Limitations of stopped-flow NMR techniques include restriction to homogenous reactions, and in contrast to Rapid Injection NMR, the inability to add reagents partway through the monitoring process. Moreover, none of the set-ups highlighted above is yet suitable for monitoring processes occurring at high pressure or involving/generating gases.The classical stopped-flow set-up (Fig. 11a) has some practical limitations: the total reaction volume is limited by the volume of the stop syringe, and the reagent solutions can only be mixed in a fixed volumetric ratio, usually 1:1, due to the use of a single pushing plate.

        <p>The sensitivity of NMR experiments is inherently limited by the small thermal equilibrium difference in populations between different nuclear energy levels. While not a specialised sampling or monitoring technique as such, the hyperpolarisation technique boosts the NMR signal by artificially altering these populations. Para-Hydrogen Induced Polarisation (PHIP) uses para-hydrogen generated at low temperature to generate hyperpolarisation when the hydrogen is reacted with a metal centre [146]. PHIP and associated polarisation transfer experiments such as SABRE (Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange) can be used in reaction monitoring to increase sensitivity, and are particularly useful for measurements at low field [13,14,147]. Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (DNP) uses microwave irradiation at low temperature to transfer polarisation from unpaired electrons, with potential signal enhancements of several thousand times [148].

        <p>A limiting factor on temporal resolution is the repetition rate of successive scans, determined by the longitudinal relaxation times (T 1 , Section 3.2) of the spins being detected. To avoid saturation, the magnetisation should be allowed to recover to thermal equilibrium before the next pulse. For a multiple-spin system, and a 90°p ulse, the delay normally needs to be 5 times the longest T 1 value, so that all spins approach !99.3% equilibrium before the next pulse. If this condition is not met, the differential relaxation of spins can lead to significant integration errors, and we strongly advise estimation of T 1 values before kinetics experiments are conducted. Shorter interscan delays can be allowed by using smaller pulse flip angles, at the cost of reduced sensitivity, or by adding paramagnetic relaxation agents [154][155][156], at the cost of reduced peak resolution (and potential perturbation of the chemistry under study).A limiting factor on temporal resolution is the repetition rate of successive scans, determined by the longitudinal relaxation times (T 1 , Section 3.2) of the spins being detected.

For fast reactions interleaving is conducted using rapid injection or stopped-flow methodologies (see Section 2.4.4). For slow reactions where kinetic data density is easily attained, interleaving of different NMR experiments (different nuclei, selective excitation etc.) can make use of the time between data points to acquire complementary data at no additional cost in time [158].An alternative strategy to allow more data acquisition in a given timescale relies on the interleaving process, which is practically a pseudo real-time approach [157].

        <p>One method to overcome the limitations imposed by relaxation on acquisition rate is to use different volumes ('slices') within the sample for each data point, in a similar way to an MRI experiment. Electrical current is supplied to a coil around the sample, creating a linear gradient in the magnetic field strength along the sample length (Fig. 15) and causing the Larmor frequency of the nuclei to vary as a function of position. A selective pulse is applied to excite each slice individually and the spectrum recorded [5,164]. Providing that sample motion (diffusion, convection, etc.) between slices is slow, the magnetisation in each slice can be sampled independently of its neighbours. The latter aspects means that the technique cannot be applied with flow-NMR (Section 2.4.3).One method to overcome the limitations imposed by relaxation on acquisition rate is to use different volumes ('slices') within the sample for each data point, in a similar way to an MRI experiment.

However, as each slice is a small volume of the total reaction, the signalto-noise decreases as a function of the slice size (volume). This means that spatially-selective experiments require more concentrated samples than conventional NMR experiments. To minimise cross-talk, slices should be sampled in a non-adjacent manner. Care should also be taken to account for B 1 inhomogeneity which will affect the absolute signal intensities in the various slices (Fig. 14).Sampling slices in parallel with different pulses/delays applied to each slice allows 2D spectra to be constructed in a single scan (Section 3.6).

        <p>The quantitative capability of NMR undoubtedly empowers the technique for versatile application in the investigation of reaction mechanisms. It provides a platform to determine kinetic and thermodynamic data, including reaction rate, chemical equilibrium, identification of side products, selectivity, etc. In an NMR spectrum, chemically distinct spins give rise to signals whose area, under the correct measurement conditions, is proportional to the number of nuclei. This species-independent direct proportionality is one key advantage of NMR over other techniques such as mass spectrometry, infra-red and UV-Vis spectroscopy, and chromatographic methods, all of which require calibration curves for quantitative reference. Quantitative NMR can be divided into relative and absolute methods [19,166]. Relative quantitation compares the integrals of signals with one another and determines the ratio of different compounds by employing Eq.

        <p>3.4.2.1. Shimming. Well-resolved peaks are a pre-requisite for accurate quantitation, and signal overlap hinders spectral interpretation. In order to generate sharp signals where the linewidth at half-height D 1=2 ¼ 1=ðpT 2 Þ is only limited by the inherent transverse relaxation, the static magnetic field across the whole sample volume needs to be homogenous. Good shimming is a process to minimise the field inhomogeneity by adjusting the currents in a set of 'shim coils' around the probe. These coils create small magnetic fields that correct small inhomogeneities in the field of the main magnet, such that the sample experiences a nearhomogenous field overall. Shims are designed to produce fields with different geometries and detailed examples of 'imperfect' FIDs caused by particular types of poor shimming and their corresponding Fourier transformed peaks have been reviewed [169]. Nowadays the shimming process is generally conducted automatically, however, if one suspects distorted peaks are arising from poor shimming, one can manually optimise the relevant shimming parameters [169].3.4.2.1.

        <p>3.4.2.2. Acquisition time and repetition time. Acquisition time plays an essential role in sensitivity and quantification. If the acquisition time is too short, the FID truncation will result in 'wiggles' alongside the peaks in the final NMR spectrum. Conversely if the acquisition time is too long, then the tail of the FID is simply recording noise, rather than signal, thus reducing the S/N. An appropriate relaxation delay between pulses in acquisition of sequential spectra is vital for quantitative measurements. For a multi-spin system, the repetition time needs to be long enough for the slowest relaxing spin to fully recover. Therefore, a knowledge or estimation of the T 1 values (Section 3.2) for all of the species that will be monitored is valuable prior to experiments; with judicious choice of signals in the species present, a sub-set of signals can be monitored if required.3.4.2.2.

        <p>To allow processing and storage on a computer, the analogue signal detected by the probe must be converted to a digital signal. To ensure that the signal fills the full range of the analogue-to-digital converter the analogue signal is amplified by a receiver gain (RG) factor before digitisation. If the RG is too low, the NMR signal will occupy only part of the digital range, leading to a reduction in vertical (voltage) resolution in the FID. Conversely, if the RG is too high the receiver will become saturated and broad 'sinc' wiggles may be observed in the baseline of the FT spectrum [170]. For quantitative analysis of signals, it is sufficient to select an RG value that allows the time domain signal (FID) to fit comfortably within the dynamic range of the analogueto-digital converter. A calibrated receiver gain function method [171] can be implemented to allow quantitative comparison between separate experiments recorded with different RG.To allow processing and storage on a computer, the analogue signal detected by the probe must be converted to a digital signal.

        <p>For quantitative assessment, all resonances must be excited equally across the whole chemical shift range. Setting the transmitter frequency offset at the midpoint of anticipated or known range of resonances, for the entire set of reaction components, is a reasonable first approach. For more uniform excitation, the CHORUS pulse sequence [172,173] can be employed to increase the quantitative bandwidth, particularly for spectra with wide chemical shift range (e.g. 13 C, 19 F, and 31 P). However, it is noteworthy that a rectangular excitation pulse of duration t p gives &gt;95% excitation over an effective spectral width (in Hz) of approximately SW = 1/(4 Â t p ), where t p is generally in the order of tens of microseconds. Tuning, matching and pulse calibration help ensure optimal pulse amplitudes. Pulse calibration is advisable before performing experiments that are particularly sensitive to pulse angle, such as those with large numbers of refocusing or inversion pulses where small variations in pulse amplitude may accumulate, reducing the signal, however for most experiments the default pulse calibration usually suffices. In practice, using smaller pulse angles for higher temporal resolution also comes with the benefit of broader excitation coverage. Therefore, it is not a problem for nuclei such as 1 H with a typical chemical shift range of $10-15 ppm, but for nuclei that cover a much larger frequency range, for example 19 F nuclei -often used for reaction monitoring -achieving uniform excitation can be more challenging. Indeed for reactions where a wide range of 19 F chemical shifts are present, the quantitation can be compromised for nuclei at the 'edge' of the spectrum if conventional 90°pulse excitation is used. If this is not taken into account, later analysis of the reaction kinetics may be significantly impacted by under-estimation of the concentration of the signals close to the edges of the spectrum.For quantitative assessment, all resonances must be excited equally across the whole chemical shift range.

        <p>It is important to make sure that the spectral width (SW) is sufficient that all signals from species present in the reaction mixture are captured, or, if some are to be omitted, that they are well away from the edge of the spectral window. Signals that are within the spectral window but too close to its edge may be affected by receiver filters, leading to phase and amplitude distortion. In general, it is recommended to extend the spectral window approximately 10% beyond the signals at both edges. Signals that are insufficiently outside of the spectral window can cause signal folding or alias peaks, that is, a peak at a frequency (f max + F) greater than the Nyquist frequency (f max ) would appear at the incorrect frequency at (Àf max + F) [4], where f max = 1/ (2DW), DW is the dwell time. Such folded signals are usually harder or impossible to phase, and can be recognised by the way their frequencies change on changing the transmitter offset.It is important to make sure that the spectral width (SW) is sufficient that all signals from species present in the reaction mixture are captured, or, if some are to be omitted, that they are well away from the edge of the spectral window.

        <p>3.4.2.6. Broadband decoupling. Heteronuclear decoupled experiments are sometimes necessary to achieve a simplified spectrum with better-resolved signals. This can allow species to be more accurately quantified, and can be especially useful in cases where satellites, e.g. due to 1 J CH for strong 1 H NMR signals of carbon bound hydrogens, overshadow neighbouring weak signals arising from intermediates or side products. Composite pulse sequences such as WALTZ and GARP are still commonly used for effective heteronuclear decoupling. However, adiabatic methods such as CHIRP pulses are now recommended, as they offer wider decoupling bandwidths, in addition to reducing sample heating. If applied, different decoupling modes should be evaluated carefully. For example, 13 C spectra recorded with continuous 1 H decoupling are rarely straightforwardly quantitative, due to the Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) build-up during the relaxation delay [174,175]. To improve quantitation, decoupling should be applied only during the acquisition time and turned off during the relaxation delay time, with a long relaxation delay (or if chemically feasible, the addition of paramagnetic relaxation agents) for full magnetisation recovery and dissipation of the NOEs. This inverse-gated decoupling is also commonly utilized in 15 N or 29 Si acquisition to suppress NOE build-up as these negative gyromagnetic ratio nuclei exhibit negative NOE enhancements, which can lead to reduced or even negative signals for the observed nucleus. It is not infrequent to find that quantitation has been assumed (but not tested) in an NMR investigation, e.g. using 31 P{ 1 H} NMR signals from phos-phine ligands in an organometallic process, resulting in large errors propagating unnoticed into the kinetic analysis and reporting of rate and equilibrium constants etc.3.4.2.6.

        <p>There are different types of weighting functions available in most processing software and these functions have different effects on sensitivity and resolution. For example, multiplying the FID by a decaying function can improve the sensitivity (or more strictly, the signal-to-noise ratio, S/N), but at the penalty of signal broadening. For well-resolved signals in a reaction time series, such a function can be of benefit. In contrast, multiplying the FID by a function that first rises and then falls can enhance resolution but at the cost of sensitivity. A reasonable compromise of weighting function is usually used, with a half=Gaussian function being a popular choice. It is important to note that not all weighting functions are appropriate for quantitation, as functions where the first point is zero result in zero integral in the normal phase-sensitive spectrum and are therefore of very limited value for quantitative NMR.There are different types of weighting functions available in most processing software and these functions have different effects on sensitivity and resolution.

        <p>A distorted baseline obstructs the accurate quantification of signals, and significant baseline rolls can even disguise extremely broad, weak signals in a spectrum. Methods for flattening the baseline can be generally categorised into time-domain baseline correction and frequency-domain baseline correction. Time-domain methods correct data points in the FID. For example, a major source of baseline artefacts lies in corruption of the first points of the FID caused by strong, rapidly decaying background signals from materials used in the construction of the probe or NMR tube (commonly observed for 10/11 B, 29 Si and 19 F). Acoustic ringing caused by RF pulses inducing mechanical resonance of metallic components in the probe also causes strong, rapidly decaying signals to appear in the FID, particularly for nuclei with low Larmor frequencies. A third source of baseline artefacts is 'ring-down' caused by the dissipation of pulse energy in the probe electronics and is commonly observed with cryoprobes. In most cases the corrupted points can be deleted and the missing information replaced by backward linear prediction [176], while proper setup of the preacquisition delay can reduce the effects of ring-down. Frequencydomain correction methods reconstruct the baseline in Fourier transformed spectra by applying algorithms that distinguish between signal and baseline regions, and then subtract a function that is fitted to the baseline [177][178][179]. Modern spectrometers and software today offer both automated and manual baseline correction approaches to this process. However, such techniques must be applied with great caution. Signals from reaction intermediates that are involved in dynamic processes, and as a result have broad lines, can experience apparent intensity distortions as a result of inappropriate baseline correction, leading to highly misleading integrals and erroneous reaction kinetics. Comparison of relative integrals of various species in the reaction mixture before and after baseline correction is advisable.A distorted baseline obstructs the accurate quantification of signals, and significant baseline rolls can even disguise extremely broad, weak signals in a spectrum.

        <p>Phase correction is routinely applied during processing of a spectrum. It aims to adjust the signals to pure absorption mode lineshape, or to maximise peak symmetry. Although auto-phasing is available in most software and is fast to carry out, it is recommended that spectra should be manually phased for a more accurate result. This is particularly important for low-intensity signals, which can be of great relevance, for example, in the analysis of kinetic isotope effects (Section 5.3). Phase correction includes both a zero-order correction, applied equally across the whole spectrum regardless of offset, and a first-order correction, which corrects phase errors that vary linearly with the offset. Excessive first-order phase correction, caused by an incorrect pre-acquisition delay, can cause baseline distortion and affect quantitation.Phase correction is routinely applied during processing of a spectrum.

        <p>Before the FID undergoes Fourier transformation into the frequency domain, it is composed of time-domain data points which define the signals. Zero-filling is a postacquisition manipulation that adds a set of data points (zeroes) to the end of the original FID, where the signal has normally already decayed close to zero, so that the signals in the Fourier transformed spectrum are better represented by more data points. Adding the same number of zeroes as there are experimental points to the end of the FID before transformation both doubles the amount of information in the resultant spectrum and improves digital resolution. Further zero-filling just interpolates between data points, but may still aid interpretation.Before the FID undergoes Fourier transformation into the frequency domain, it is composed of time-domain data points which define the signals.

        <p>A reliable method for determining the strength of an NMR signal is essential for quantitative analysis of reaction kinetics, titrations, equilibria, etc. The most common way of determining peak area is by integration, however peak fitting can also be used. It is imperative that integral regions are consistent throughout a series of spectra. Thus, for instance, one must consistently include or exclude satellites for all peaks measured. If the satellites severely overlap with neighbouring signals, then appropriate decoupling or filtration [180] is recommended (Section 3.4.2.6). The integral regions should cover the same proportion of each peak; for example, integrating a single Lorentzian over a range of at least 20 times the line width in either direction should cover 99% of the peak area, however smaller integration regions may be more appropriate if peaks are close together.A reliable method for determining the strength of an NMR signal is essential for quantitative analysis of reaction kinetics, titrations, equilibria, etc. The most common way of determining peak area is by integration, however peak fitting can also be used.

        <p>In principle, NMR peaks are purely Lorentzian in shape, however in practice distortions caused by magnetic field inhomogeneity, relaxation and chemical kinetics mean that hybrid functions with more degrees of freedom (for example a Voigt function comprising a mixture of Lorentzian and Gaussian functions) can provide a better fit [4]. Fitting a single NMR spectrum using multiple Voigt functions is straightforward, however automatic fitting of large numbers of spectra from reaction monitoring can be problematic as there are often several ways in which a given peak can be fitted (Fig. 15). Generally, minimising the number of degrees of freedom by using fewer peaks and restricting large changes in linewidth and position between adjacent spectra tends to provide the best results when fitting large datasets. Once a dataset has been deconvoluted, and the data is analysed, e.g. in a kinetics simulation, it is important to remember that the deconvolution may not be correct for some or all data points.

In this way the dimensionality is reduced to include only those variables which are important to the reaction kinetics.3.4.4.1. Principal component analysis.

        <p>Pure shift NMR, also known as broadband homonuclear decoupled NMR, aids in the interpretation of overcrowded or poorly resolved spectra, and can be particularly useful for complex reaction mixtures with numerous intermediates or side products. Pure shift techniques address this problem by eliminating the effect of homonuclear scalar couplings while retaining the chemical shift information. As a result, multiplets are collapsed into singlets, where one singlet represents one distinctive chemical site, hence offering much 'cleaner' spectra. Despite the sensitivity reduction and generally long experimental time, the unique characteristic of significant enhancement in spectral resolution of pure shift NMR still empowers this technique with the capability to resolve signals that are difficult to assign in conventional NMR.Pure shift NMR, also known as broadband homonuclear decoupled NMR, aids in the interpretation of overcrowded or poorly resolved spectra, and can be particularly useful for complex reaction mixtures with numerous intermediates or side products.

        <p>Comprehensive reviews on this relatively recent area can be found in publications; [185,186] the main pure shift approaches [187][188][189][190][191] are introduced here chronologically, based on their date of publication. BIRD [187] (Bilinear Rotational Decoupling) utilizes the low isotopic abundance of 13 C (1.1%), by decoupling a 13 Cbound proton from its neighbouring 12 C-bound protons. Scalar couplings between geminal protons are thus excluded from BIRD decoupling as they are bound to the same 13 C nucleus. Although providing high-quality quantitative spectral data, BIRD decoupling comes at the cost of sensitivity À1.1% of a normal spectrum. The idea of a spatially-and frequency-selective decoupling method, introduced by Zangger and Sterk [188], employs a weak pulsed field gradient along with a selective refocusing pulse. Different locations in the NMR sample tube experience different magnetic fields, allowing signals at different chemical shifts to be spatiallyselectively decoupled. One limitation of this method is its low sensitivity: the more selective the slice-selective excitation pulse, the lower the sensitivity. The band-selective approach [189] is particularly efficient when only a targeted region of the spectrum requires analysis. The difference between the band-selective and Zangger-Sterk pulse sequences is the absence of the weak pulsed field gradient. Band-selective decoupling only suppresses the effects of coupling to spins outside the selected band of frequencies, but has excellent sensitivity because all spins in the selected region contribute to the measured signal. SHARPER [190] (Sensitive, Homogenous, And Resolved PEaks in Real time) presents a pure shift method that is particularly suitable for the analysis of chemical reactions and the monitoring of reaction kinetics. This method focuses on a single selected signal and removes its heteronuclear couplings (and homonuclear couplings in the case of sel-SHARPER), generating an extremely narrow singlet with significant improvement in the S/N. PSYCHE [191] (Pure Shift Yielded by CHirp Excitation) uses two low pulse angle (approximately 15°) chirp pulses that sweep frequency in opposite directions. This pair of frequency-swept pulses separates the nuclear spins into two populations, where the separation is purely statistical. J refocusing is achieved by the combination of the CHIRP pulses and a hard 180°pulse; the magnetic field gradient during the CHIRP pulses serves to suppress signal pathways that do not refocus the effects of J. PSYCHE is relatively sensitive, and particularly robust in strongly coupled systems.Comprehensive reviews on this relatively recent area can be found in publications; [185,186] the main pure shift approaches [187][188][189][190][191] are introduced here chronologically, based on their date of publication. BIRD [187] (Bilinear Rotational Decoupling) utilizes the low isotopic abundance of 13 C (1.1%), by decoupling a 13 Cbound proton from its neighbouring 12 C-bound protons. Scalar couplings between geminal protons are thus excluded from BIRD decoupling as they are bound to the same 13 C nucleus. Although providing high-quality quantitative spectral data, BIRD decoupling comes at the cost of sensitivity À1.1% of a normal spectrum. The idea of a spatially-and frequency-selective decoupling method, introduced by Zangger and Sterk [188], employs a weak pulsed field gradient along with a selective refocusing pulse. Different locations in the NMR sample tube experience different magnetic fields, allowing signals at different chemical shifts to be spatiallyselectively decoupled. One limitation of this method is its low sensitivity: the more selective the slice-selective excitation pulse, the lower the sensitivity. The band-selective approach [189] is particularly efficient when only a targeted region of the spectrum requires analysis. The difference between the band-selective and Zangger-Sterk pulse sequences is the absence of the weak pulsed field gradient. Band-selective decoupling only suppresses the effects of coupling to spins outside the selected band of frequencies, but has excellent sensitivity because all spins in the selected region contribute to the measured signal. SHARPER [190] (Sensitive, Homogenous, And Resolved PEaks in Real time) presents a pure shift method that is particularly suitable for the analysis of chemical reactions and the monitoring of reaction kinetics. This method focuses on a single selected signal and removes its heteronuclear couplings (and homonuclear couplings in the case of sel-SHARPER), generating an extremely narrow singlet with significant improvement in the S/N. PSYCHE [191] (Pure Shift Yielded by CHirp Excitation) uses two low pulse angle (approximately 15°) chirp pulses that sweep frequency in opposite directions. This pair of frequency-swept pulses separates the nuclear spins into two populations, where the separation is purely statistical. J refocusing is achieved by the combination of the CHIRP pulses and a hard 180°pulse; the magnetic field gradient during the CHIRP pulses serves to suppress signal pathways that do not refocus the effects of J. PSYCHE is relatively sensitive, and particularly robust in strongly coupled systems.</p>
        <p>The main benefits of the SHARPER experiment lie in its line narrowing effect and significant S/N enhancement ($20-fold gains for the reported 19 F measurement) in heteronuclear and homonuclear decoupling while the quantitative capability is still retained. It is particularly tolerant of pulse imperfections and of magnetic field inhomogeneity, both static (e.g. shims) and dynamic (e.g. gas generation), allowing analysis of chemical reactions and equilibria in challenging environments. However, the technique is limited to analysis of one selected resonance at a time. The basic SHARPER experiment adopts the pulse sequence of Fig. 16 and removes broadband heteronuclear couplings by pulsing on the detected nucleus only. Without the necessity of pulsing on the decoupled nucleus channel as in traditional heteronuclear decoupling methods, this feature tackles spectrometer hardware limitations where the delivery of dual radio frequencies, for example 1 H and 19 F pulses, is problematic. This 'single channel heteronuclear decoupling' executes the simultaneous removal of all splittings caused by X nuclei for the signal of interest.The main benefits of the SHARPER experiment lie in its line narrowing effect and significant S/N enhancement ($20-fold gains for the reported 19 F measurement) in heteronuclear and homonuclear decoupling while the quantitative capability is still retained.

        <p>Minor modifications of the SHARPER experiment lead to the sel-SHARPER pulse sequence (Fig. 17), where both heteronuclear and homonuclear decoupling is achieved. This pure shift experiment utilises the same real-time acquisition method as SHARPER, with the acquisition time divided into chunks separated by two selective 180°pulses that invert the subset of passive spins while leaving the active spins unperturbed. The acquisition sequence is looped, with each successive chunk appended to the end of the FID to construct the time domain spectrum. The phases of the pulses and receiver are rotated by 90°between chunks to compensate for pulse imperfections and static magnetic field inhomogeneity. This results in substantial sensitivity improvement by collapsing the multiplets in the normal 1 H-coupled spectrum to a narrow singlet (typically &lt; 0.5 Hz linewidth) in the sel-SHARPER spectrum. Chemical equilibrium kinetics can also be studied by analysing the excess line broadening of signals, arising from the relaxation caused by fast chemical exchange. [190] In general pure shift spectra can be used for quantitative measurements, providing appropriate precautions are taken. Spin manipulations including the selective pulses used in Zangger-Sterk, band-selective and sel-SHARPER experiments mean that integrals from different parts of the spectrum cannot be directly compared, in part because different signals will experience different relaxation losses, however integrals from a single peak can be compared across successive spectra acquired with the same parameters. The distinct benefits of pure shift NMR methods have mostly been applied in the analysis of 1 H-detected species. However, we expect applications of this technique in reaction monitoring, and in the interrogation of exchange processes and equilibria via analysis of other nuclei, to grow.Minor modifications of the SHARPER experiment lead to the sel-SHARPER pulse sequence (Fig. 17), where both heteronuclear and homonuclear decoupling is achieved.

        <p>2D NMR is usually considered to be a non-quantitative technique, since peak volumes are dependent not only on the T 1 and T 2 relaxation times (cf. quantitative 1D-NMR, q1D), but also coupling constants, evolution delays, pulse imperfections and other pulse sequence variables [194]. The large number of parameters involved in 2D acquisition makes generating quantitative 2D spectra (q2D) much more complicated than q1D.

See Case Study 8. with overlapping peaks that cannot be quantified by other means. The simplest approach to obtaining quantitative concentration data from 2D spectra is to build a calibration curve using known concentrations of reagents and internal standard (Section 2.1.2) that can be used to convert peak volumes to concentration [195]. This approach is common across other analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy, but is time consuming and requires reaction and calibration data to be acquired under identical conditions. Additionally, many reactive intermediates that are of interest for reaction monitoring are too short-lived to allow calibration using this method. If relaxation rates, coupling constants and other pulse sequence parameters are known, the calibration factor for each peak may be calculated [196], however this presents many of the same challenges as acquiring a full calibration curve.Low-level field gradient pulses (PFGs) are applied surrounding the inverting pulses, loop parameter n denotes the number of loops for the double 180°pulses.

        <p>Instead of compensating for pulses and delays individually the HSQC 0 experiment treats the HSQC pulse sequence as a process that attenuates the signal for each peak. Repeating the part of the HSQC sequence following the initial 90°pulse twice would therefore mean that the signal is attenuated twice. The HSQC 0 experiment acquires several spectra with different number of repetitions (i ! 2). Linear fitting of the logarithms of peak volumes (V i n for peak n, where f A n is the attenuation factor for peak n) for the different spectra allows the 'time-zero' peak volume (V 0 n ) to be extrapolated Eq.

Good signal-to-noise ratio is also necessary to ensure that the peak volumes can be accurately fitted. Due to the requirement for repeated acquisition and long relaxation delays, q2D NMR experiments are considerably slower to acquire than conventional 2D NMR experiments and may not be suitable for monitoring all reactions.This effectively corrects any errors that have a linear dependence on time, such as those associated with evolution delays, pulse imperfections and relaxation during the pulse sequence, resulting in more quantitative data [203].

        <p>Conventional 2D NMR requires a new FID to be acquired for each point in the indirect dimension (Fig. 18). As a result, digital resolution in the indirect dimension is usually much lower, typically with 10 -200 times fewer points compared to the direct dimension.

As the sampled points are representative of the full range of indirect dimension frequencies, a 2D FID can be reconstructed during processing and then Fourier transformed to produce the two-dimensional spectrum (Fig. 18).

        <p>Many different methods have been developed to enhance relaxation via polarisation sharing [210][211][212], however the most relevant to small molecule reaction monitoring is Acceleration by Sharing Adjacent Polarization (ASAP) [213][214][215][216][217]. ASAP experiments use a TOCSY mixing pulse of around 40 ms to transfer magnetisation from donor protons (H d ) in the reservoir to the acceptor proton (H a ) that is detected in the NMR experiment (Fig. 20b,c). Polarisation sharing returns the acceptor proton to close to equilibrium magnetisation much faster than if it were relaxing freely, allowing a shorter relaxation delay (s R ) to be used.Many different methods have been developed to enhance relaxation via polarisation sharing [210][211][212], however the most relevant to small molecule reaction monitoring is Acceleration by Sharing Adjacent Polarization (ASAP) [213][214][215][216][217].

An alternative approach is to make use of the recovery time to gain additional information. In a typical NMR experiment, regardless of whether it is 1D, 2D etc., the signal is recorded on just one channel. Any magnetisation remaining on other NMR active nuclei is unobserved and 'wasted'. Simply adding an extra receiver to detect this magnetisation increases the amount of information that can be acquired in a single experiment, and can even allow parallel acquisition of two different experiments [227][228][229].The approaches discussed above have mainly considered methods to mitigate the long recovery time required for quantitative NMR.

        <p>In organic and organometallic chemistry, the most common method to obtain data for kinetic analysis is to measure the changes in concentrations of species as a system approaches equilibrium (Scheme 1a); in many cases the reverse reaction is undetectable. Depending on the reaction, the experiment can be conducted in two distinct ways. In the more conventional approach, the reaction is initiated, by adding for example a reagent or catalyst, or an external trigger (e.g. light) is used, and the ensuing approach to equilibrium is analysed. Alternatively, a rapid change in conditions is applied to a system already at equilibrium, and the ensuing changes in concentrations are followed as the system 'relaxes' to establish a new equilibrium state (Scheme 2, Section 4.2.1).In organic and organometallic chemistry, the most common method to obtain data for kinetic analysis is to measure the changes in concentrations of species as a system approaches equilibrium (Scheme 1a); in many cases the reverse reaction is undetectable.

        <p>There are several limitations to the above method (Scheme 1a), the most important being the timescale of the chemical reaction of interest. Firstly the overall process, or some elements of it, must be slow with respect to the differences in Larmor frequencies between peaks, so that distinct signals are detected for substrates, products, and if they significantly accumulate, intermediates. Secondly, the reaction must not be so fast that it proceeds to completion before measurements can be made, although specialised in situ methods (Section 2.4.4) can help. However, if the process is at dynamic equilibrium (Scheme 1b), it can still be possible to obtain kinetic information by NMR. Depending on the rate, this can be achieved by probing changes in spin populations after the system has been disturbed by an appropriate pulse sequence, or more generally by line shape (bandshape) analysis (see Case Studies 3 and 8).

        <p>Acquiring kinetic data for non-equilibrium systems usually comprises three stages: i. optional measurement of an initial ('t 0 '; time zero) NMR spectrum, ii. initiation of the reaction or perturbation of the conditions; iii. periodic acquisition of spectra comprising single or multiple FIDs. With an appropriate standard (see Section 2.1.2) the initial concentrations to be used in kinetic modelling can usually be determined from the initial spectrum; one exception to this is in the case of fast reaction initiated by stopped flow, where a genuine t 0 spectrum is not measured. The rate of acquisition of spectra is dependent on the nature of the experiment, and is sometimes the most challenging aspect for the experimentalist. The reliability of the primary data must be borne in mind when extracting kinetic information from it. For a process that is relatively rapid, steps must be taken to reduce the time needed to acquire a spectrum (e.g. reducing the pulse angle and decreasing the number of scans) to increase kinetic data density. These adjustments can lead to loss of S/N and make quantitative study of low concentration species unreliable.Acquiring kinetic data for non-equilibrium systems usually comprises three stages: i. optional measurement of an initial ('t 0 '; time zero) NMR spectrum, ii. initiation of the reaction or perturbation of the conditions; iii. periodic acquisition of spectra comprising single or multiple FIDs. With an appropriate standard (see Section 2.1.2) the initial concentrations to be used in kinetic modelling can usually be determined from the initial spectrum; one exception to this is in the case of fast reaction initiated by stopped flow, where a genuine t 0 spectrum is not measured. The rate of acquisition of spectra is dependent on the nature of the experiment, and is sometimes the most challenging aspect for the experimentalist. The reliability of the primary data must be borne in mind when extracting kinetic information from it.

        <p>The general principle of the relaxation-based kinetics experiment is illustrated in Scheme 2. Examples of chemical relaxation experiments include a rapid change ('jump') in temperature, pH, pressure, or concentration (e.g. via dilution). A useful feature of the temperature jump [235][236][237][238][239][240], and of the pressure jump [241], experiment is that they can be repeated numerous times on the same sample, provided that the system is chemically stable. Moreover, as the reactants are already pre-mixed in the solution, there are no mass transfer considerations, provided that the system is thermally homogeneous.The general principle of the relaxation-based kinetics experiment is illustrated in Scheme 2.

        <p>Temperature jump is the most common method for chemical relaxation NMR experiments, and has been widely utilised in studying protein folding dynamics. NMR spectrometers can operate over a range of temperatures, and the temperature of the probe can routinely be changed, within instrument-specific limits (Section 2.1.1.1). However, the rates of heat transfer from the VT gas to the solution are too slow (see Fig. 1) for rapid temperature jump experiments in situ. Thus, the first temperature jump experiment in NMR spectroscopy, the refolding of Ribonuclease A, was performed by external temperature jump. The NMR tube containing the sample was maintained at 45 °C in a heating block, then rapidly cooled to 10 °C by partial immersion in a water-ice bath. The 10 °C sample was then rapidly inserted into the probe, pre-cooled to 10 °C. Data acquisition began about 30 s after the (external) 35 °C temperature drop, and the refolding was monitored at 10 °C for about 25 min inside the probe [235]. In order to improve the method, various techniques have been developed to perform rapid in situ temperature jumps, some of which enable temperature changes of up to 25 K in &lt;20 ms [236][237][238][239][240]. Achieving solution phase pressure jumps in the sample in the NMR probe is technically much more demanding, and has mostly been used to study protein folding [241]. The technique has not yet been adopted for mechanistic NMR analysis of organic and organometallic processes, but offers great potential.Temperature jump is the most common method for chemical relaxation NMR experiments, and has been widely utilised in studying protein folding dynamics.

        <p>The data obtained in an NMR chemical relaxation experiment is intensity (and thus concentration) vs time. Both the forward and reverse processes must be accounted for, and in a first order A B system, Fig. 21, a simple differential equation (Eq. ( 9)) can be applied. Here k 1 and k -1 are the rate constants of the forward and reverse reaction under the new conditions (after the 'jump'), with x being the difference between the temporal and final (equilibrium) concentrations, i.e. [A] t = [A] 1 + x. Integration of Eq. ( 9) gives the concentration dependence as a function of time (Eq. ( 10)) where x 0 is the shift from the new equilibrium immediately after the jump, and x the shift after time t. The equation can then be fitted to the experimental data, Fig. 21, using standard nonlinear regression.The data obtained in an NMR chemical relaxation experiment is intensity (and thus concentration) vs time.

        <p>For both the classical irreversible initiation, and chemical relaxation methods, appropriate steps should be taken when processing the acquired data to ensure that it reflects the evolution of the reaction, and not progressive errors or irregularities resulting from spectral acquisition or processing. Thus the spectra must all be processed under identical conditions to minimise any differences between the spectra that might corrupt the relative integrals between or within the series. For convenience, the NMR spectra can be opened in parallel in a ''stacked" format, available in all common NMR spectral processing software packages. Phase and baseline corrections should be applied (in that order) before integration, ensuring that peaks have the correct line-shape (using reference deconvolution methods, Section 3.4.4.3, if needed) and that the spectral baseline is flat. The integrated areas of broad peaks can be substantially attenuated by some baseline correction methods. Chemical shift correction (referencing) is also recommended in order for spectra to be externally comparable.For both the classical irreversible initiation, and chemical relaxation methods, appropriate steps should be taken when processing the acquired data to ensure that it reflects the evolution of the reaction, and not progressive errors or irregularities resulting from spectral acquisition or processing.

        <p>Finally, before integration of the signals relevant to the reaction evolution, the integral of the internal standard should be normalised to eliminate any external changes in absolute intensity such as receiver gain re-optimisation. This is often not an issue, especially when spectra are all acquired using the same acquisition parameters, but it should be noted that any re-optimisation of these parameters will likely result in variation of the absolute intensity of the signal. This underscores the importance of choosing the right internal standard. Without such a standard, kinetic data acquired by integrating spectra where the acquisition parameters are continually re-optimised, for example in reactions run in interrupted in situ mode (see Section 2.2.1) can become unreliable.Finally, before integration of the signals relevant to the reaction evolution, the integral of the internal standard should be normalised to eliminate any external changes in absolute intensity such as receiver gain re-optimisation.

The sum of these powers is known as the order of the reaction. For elementary reactions (those which occur in a single step) the partial orders are equal to the stoichiometric coefficients of each species, as defined in the chemical equation, Eq. ( 12). However, most reactions of interest contain multiple steps, with the rates of later reaction steps depending on the concentrations of reaction intermediates generated in earlier steps. Thus the overall rate equation for a multistep reaction of any complexity usually applies the assumption that the intermediate species exist in a steady state.In the example in Eq.

        <p>Using the steady-state approximation, where the rate of change of the concentration of a reaction intermediate is assumed to be negligible, allows simplifications to be made. In the example shown in Eq. ( 13), substrate A converts to product to P, via equilibrium with reactive intermediate B, and a steady-state approximation rate equation can be simply derived. This is easily extended to an analogous reaction involving an additional reagent C which captures intermediate B (Eq. ( 14)). In the first case (Eq. ( 13)), where all steps are unimolecular, the resulting steady state rate equation takes the form of a power law, where all of the individual rate constants are collapsed into a single constant denoted k obs (the observed rate constant). This is often not strictly applicable, as in the common case (Eq. ( 14)) where step 2 (k 2 ) is bimolecular. This leads to an equation whose structure requires a split denominator, containing concentration terms as well as constants. Here it can be seen that the concentrations cannot be separated into the form of a power law, which means that the reaction order is (at least technically) undefined unless limiting conditions are applied. As the complexity of a reaction increases, and more intermediates are added, the complexity and number of terms in the steady state rate equation also increase, often disproportionately.

        <p>4.3.4.1. The pre-equilibrium approximation. The Michaelis-Menten rate expression rests on the assumption that all catalyst species are connected in a rapidly attained (non-rate limiting) equilibrium state [246]. The other key assumption made by this (and other) steady state analyses of catalytic systems is that the substrate (or substrates) is in large excess over the catalyst. A general rule is that the catalyst loading should not exceed 10% of the concentration of the limiting substrate. This is because this model is unable to account for the amount of substrate that is used to populate substrate-or product-containing intermediates in the catalytic cycle. As the catalyst loading increases, so does the proportion of substrate that is required to maintain the catalytic intermediates; when this amount is a large proportion of the total substrate concentration (at high catalyst loadings), this offset starts to noticeably affect the quality of the analysis. In rate equations of this type, the numerator corresponds to the product of the equilibrium and rate constants (with substrates as required) representing a complete productive cycle round the catalytic system. The denominator represents a normalised sum of all of the possible catalyst states; the number 1 corresponds to an initial state, and subsequent states are defined as the products of the equilibrium constants and substrates, Fig. 22.4.3.4.1.

        <p>4.3.4.2. Briggs-Haldane rate equations. The Briggs-Haldane rate expression [247], Fig. 22, is the second most common form used for catalytic cycles, and again assumes that all of the catalyst species are in a steady state; it is distinguished from the Michaelis-Menten expression in that it breaks all equilibrium terms (K n ) down into their microscopic rate constants (k n and k -n ). This approach leads to superficially more complex rate equations, but is much more generally applicable than the Michaelis-Menten approach. In the Briggs-Haldane rate expression, any of the steps can be rate determining; this is true even of a forward rate constant for a reversible step, which would be assumed to be very rapid in a Michaelis-Menten rate equation. The numerator of these equations is very similar to that of the Michaelis-Menten equations, but the denominator is derived differently; the collection of terms represents all possible ways in which a given catalytic state can be generated from each of the other catalytic states. When using NMR to monitor and study reactions, the direct detection of catalyst speciation states is dependent on two conditions being met. Firstly, there must be sufficient concentration of catalyst present (compared to substrate and product) for detection to be feasible, and thus low catalyst concentrations can result in species being undetectable above the noise. Secondly, the resonances corresponding to different catalyst states must be in a slow-exchange regime. Fast exchange of catalyst species results in a single set of resonances, whose integral corresponds to the sum of the concentrations of all states and whose chemical shift represents a weighted average of the shifts of all species involved in the rapid exchange process.4.3.4.2.

        <p>If the catalyst resting state can be identified, or conversely, catalyst species shown to be in negligible concentration relative to others, rate equations of Michaelis-Menten or Briggs-Haldane form can be greatly simplified. In short, if a rate constant in a proposed cycle is much smaller than the others, then terms containing it can often be omitted, or subsumed into a single collection of terms, for instance in the denominator of a rate equation. Such eliminations are commonplace in both linear and catalytic rate equations and result in simplified forms. In very pronounced cases this can result in further cancellations from the rate equation and lead to more dramatic simplifications. More broadly, this can be considered one of the reasons why superficially complex reaction systems involving multiple reagents can, under limiting conditions, display behaviour consistent with very simple rate equations.If the catalyst resting state can be identified, or conversely, catalyst species shown to be in negligible concentration relative to others, rate equations of Michaelis-Menten or Briggs-Haldane form can be greatly simplified.

        <p>A key advantage of NMR in this regard is that multiple species can be monitored simultaneously. Because of this capacity for multispecies quantification, multiple parameters can often be fitted using a single experimental dataset.

Underfitting and overfitting. Two limiting regimes should be borne in mind when fitting kinetic models to experimental data. The first is underfitting, and usually arises when a model is incomplete because intermediates, side products, or catalyst species present in significant concentration have not been detected experimentally, or have not been included in the model (Fig. 23a). This can occur when rapid chemical exchange between intermediates results in a single set of time averaged resonances. It is important to consider that the integral of any resonance in this set will reflect the sum of the concentrations of all species in rapid exchange with it, while the chemical shift of this resonance will reflect a weighted average of the shifts of these same species.A key advantage of NMR in this regard is that multiple species can be monitored simultaneously.

        <p>The second is overfitting, and occurs when more species are invoked in a model than can be monitored experimentally. Indeed, when multiple species are present in a model and are ''untethered" to temporal concentration data, many different sets of rate constants and arrangements of species can be used to achieve an apparently good fit with experiment, making mechanistic interpretation unreliable. In Fig. 23b two intermediates have been added to the model used in Fig. 23a: one is experimentally detected (purple), the other is proposed but undetected (black). The model in Fig. 23b now fits very well to the data, but only does so when the rate constants are adjusted to make the concentration of the undetected intermediate in the model, vanishingly low (see inset to graph). In Fig. 23c, removal of the undetected intermediate still allows for a good (in fact slightly better) fit to the experimental data, and this is the model that should be retained, with the caveat that there may be further undetected intermediates. In other words, if more information becomes available at a later date, for example to support the proposal that the NMR-undetected intermediate (black) in Fig. 23b is present, then the complexity of the model can be increased to accommodate it.The second is overfitting, and occurs when more species are invoked in a model than can be monitored experimentally.

        <p>Analysis of plots based on integrated rate equations for simple kinetic systems has long been an invaluable tool for determining the empirical rate constants, and kinetic orders with respect to reagents and catalysts. In the majority of cases, fitting to linearised expressions distorts the statistical weights of the experimental data points, and non-linear regression is recommended. For example, a first order temporal decay in the concentration of reactant, 'A', is better analysed by non-linear regression of [A] t = [A] 0 e Àkt , than linear regression of a ln([A] 0 /[A] t ) = kt. It is also important to note that these simple graphical analyses do not account for various phenomena in complex multistep reactions, including for example, changes in rate determining step, catalyst deactivation, induction periods, autocatalysis, and product inhibition. Analogously, monitoring initial rates, and hence discarding most of the reaction course from studies, also results in loss of valuable information on such process, that may only be evident on careful examination of the whole reaction profile.Analysis of plots based on integrated rate equations for simple kinetic systems has long been an invaluable tool for determining the empirical rate constants, and kinetic orders with respect to reagents and catalysts.

        <p>An increasingly popular tool for analysing the kinetic profiles of non-equilibrium systems is visual kinetic analysis (VKA) [251][252][253]. This was first used by Michaelis and Davidsohn, but substantially developed and popularised by Blackmond, and by Burés. VKA is based on monitoring the reaction throughout its whole course, and plotting original or modified data, to visually assess the reaction kinetics. In a recent minireview [251], Burés explained two main approaches: reaction profile kinetic analysis (RPKA [253], first described by Blackmond in 2005) and variable time normalised analysis (VTNA). The main advantages of VKA include that the reaction is monitored throughout its whole course rather than solely in its initial stage, and that only a simple analysis, and often only a few experiments, are required. Reaction profiles of complicated catalytic systems can be qualitatively assessed by performing simple experiments and visual comparison of a series of plots based on various functions. However, the lower precision and usually qualitative nature of the approach should be borne in mind when interpreting data using the VKA techniques. 4.3.7.1. Reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) [253]. In RPKA, the reaction is analysed by data from a measurable parameter (e.g. concentration, or rate) as a function of time [253]. This primary data is then processed to transform it into variables convenient for visual analysis. In NMR spectroscopy, signal intensities, which are directly proportional to concentrations of species, are the primary data. With sufficient data density, these can be differentiated as a function of time, e.g. by taking the derivative of a best-fit highorder polynomial, to obtain reaction rates, which are plotted against concentrations of the substrate or product.An increasingly popular tool for analysing the kinetic profiles of non-equilibrium systems is visual kinetic analysis (VKA) [251][252][253].

If the reaction is catalysed, then the same catalyst concentration is employed in both experiments. As the reaction under the second set of conditions ([A] 0 = 0.2 M, [B] 0 = 0.15 M) proceeds, and A and B are consumed, their concentrations will eventually fall to be identical to the initial conditions in the first system ([A] 0 = 0.1 M, [B] 0 = 0.05 M). The difference between the two systems is that products (and side products) are present in one but not (yet) in the other. Hence, plotting the rate of reaction against concentration of the substrate will only give coincident (often termed 'overlaying') [253] curves if there is no product or side-product inhibition, or progressive catalyst deactivation.

        <p>In order to determine the kinetic order (Section 4.3.2) with respect to a catalyst, a series of (at least two) reactions must be studied with the same initial concentrations of all substrates and different catalyst concentrations (Fig. 24b).

        <p>4.3.7.2. Variable time normalisation analysis (VTNA) [252]. The main principles of VTNA are similar to those of RPKA, in that a reaction is monitored throughout its whole course [252]. However, the key difference in VTNA is that the data is analysed as concentration (y-axis) vs f-time (x-axis), where f is a function applied to the time data to 'normalise' a series of plots. In the context of NMR spectroscopy, there is a major advantage to directly using temporal concentration data rather than having to convert this first to rate (see RPKA). In VTNA, f is varied until two (or more) plots of the same reaction system started under different initial conditions, overlay. As detailed below, the normalising function, f, depends on the specific type of VTNA experiment. These are referred to, in an analogous manner to RPKA, as same excess, different catalyst loading, and different excess. The experiments are performed to account for catalyst deactivation and/or product inhibition and to determine the reaction orders with respect to the catalyst and all substrates.4.3.7.2.

        <p>In the same excess experiment (Fig. 25a), the two plots obtained for two systems at different starting points must be shifted along the x-axis (time), so that the concentrations of substrates (and catalyst) are equal for each point; thus f-time = time + constant.

In these circumstances a further reaction with exogenous product from the start must be studied to distinguish deactivation versus product inhibition.In the same excess experiment (Fig. 25a), the two plots obtained for two systems at different starting points must be shifted along the x-axis (time), so that the concentrations of substrates (and catalyst) are equal for each point; thus f-time = time + constant.

        <p>There are two main advantages to the analysis of the kinetics of systems at chemical equilibrium. Firstly, the durations of experiments conducted on the system are not limited by the reaction rate and thus lifetime, only by the instrument time available and the chemical stability of the sample. Secondly, since the system is already pre-mixed and pre-equilibrated, the mass transfer issues that attend initiation of non-equilibrium systems can be avoided. However, as the net concentrations of all species are independent of time, systems at chemical equilibrium pose a unique challenge for standard chemical kinetic measurements. Here, NMR offers great opportunities for mechanistic analysis, and several tech-niques have been developed that enable the interrogation of such systems, provided they occur at a sufficiently fast rate [254].There are two main advantages to the analysis of the kinetics of systems at chemical equilibrium.

        <p>One approach to monitoring a dynamic equilibrium system is to disturb its magnetic equilibrium, while leaving the chemical equilibrium intact. The return of the magnetisation to its equilibrium state is affected by the dynamics of the chemical equilibrium and can thus be used to interrogate the latter. The most commonlyused techniques to achieve this are magnetisation transfer experiments (also known as Hoffman-Forsén or selective inversion recovery experiments) and EXchange SpectroscopY (EXSY; this uses the same pulse sequence as NOESY) [254][255][256][257]. In these experiments, appropriate pulse sequences allow for monitoring the return of the system to its magnetic equilibrium, as the net magnetisation of the appropriate nuclei can be followed as a function of time. 4.4.1.1. Magnetisation transfer. The pulse sequence for a selective inversion recovery experiment is shown in Fig. 26a [254]. At the beginning of the experiment, all nuclei are at magnetic equilibrium, with the net magnetization along the +z-axis. An initial 180°soft (and thus selective) pulse inverts one of the signals (at a chosen frequency) to the -z-axis. Then, after a variable delay, s, a 90°pulse is applied, with immediate acquisition of the FID. In a single experiment, this pulse sequence is repeated for a number of variable delays, and the intensities of the signals (both the selectively inverted and the initially non-inverted) are recorded as a function of the variable delay, s. The shapes of the plots of intensity against time for the inverted and non-inverted signals depend on whether chemical exchange occurs between some or all nuclei within the system. Here we discuss the concept by way of a simple two-spin model (non-coupled spins A and B; no cross-relaxation), where spin A is inverted by the soft pulse, and the spins either undergo no chemical exchange (Scheme 3a) or undergo exchange via a single-step unimolecular mechanism (Scheme 3b).One approach to monitoring a dynamic equilibrium system is to disturb its magnetic equilibrium, while leaving the chemical equilibrium intact.

        <p>In the case of no chemical exchange (Scheme 3a; Fig. 26b), the initial 180°pulse inverts one of the signals (spin A) to the -z-axis. During the variable delay, the nuclei relax longitudinally, approaching the initial +z-magnetisation. The extent to which the relaxation takes place depends on the variable delay with the limits of negative maximum intensity (-I 1 ) for s = 0, and maximum intensity (I 1 ) as s ? 1 (i.e. the intensity of the signal at magnetic equilibrium). The rest of the pulse sequence is a standard NMR experiment, which creates transverse magnetisation and allows for acquisition of the FID. Hence, the plot of intensity against time (Fig. 26b) shows a first order relaxation process from -I 1 (s = 0), approaching I 1 at s &gt; 5T 1 . Since there is no exchange in the system (k = 0), it is the same as a plot for an inversion-recovery experiment used to determine T 1 (described in Section 3.2). The soft pulse does not affect any other signals in the system (spin B in the model; Fig. 26a), and hence they show a constant value of their maximum intensity, independent of time (Fig. 26b).In the case of no chemical exchange (Scheme 3a; Fig. 26b), the initial 180°pulse inverts one of the signals (spin A) to the -z-axis.

        <p>When chemical exchange occurs, Scheme 3b, the selective inversion recovery experiment can provide information about the kinetic behaviour of the system. As above, the initial 180°pulse selectively inverts the magnetisation vector of the appropriate nuclei to the -z-axis, while leaving all other signals unaffected (see boxed species in the kinetic model in Fig. 26a). When s = 0 and when s ! 5T 1 , the situation for both the initially inverted and non-inverted signals is the same as for non-exchanging systems. However, at s values between these two extremes, two interdependent processes take place. The recovery of the initially inverted signal is accelerated by the chemical exchange (A becoming B, and B* becoming A*; Fig. 26a). The faster the exchange, the greater the deviation from first-order kinetics in the recovery of spin A (see e.g. I A versus s in Fig. 26d when kT 1 = 50). The combined relaxation and chemical exchange effects also cause the signal for B to develop a characteristic asymmetrically stretched 'V-shape' (Fig. 26c). The faster the chemical exchange, the more asymmetric the V-shape (Fig. 26d). Hence, it is straightforward to qualitatively observe chemical exchange between species via the selective inversion recovery experiment. Moreover, the I A and I B versus s data can be analysed to quantitatively interrogate the proposed mechanism, and to determine the rate constants of exchange [256][257][258].When chemical exchange occurs, Scheme 3b, the selective inversion recovery experiment can provide information about the kinetic behaviour of the system.

        <p>The length of the 180°pulse depends on the bandwidth chosen for inversion. Short pulse lengths, especially important for rapid exchange processes, mean larger bandwidths, and so large signal separation is essential for reliable quantitative data. Lastly, the above description holds true for non-coupled spin systems. Any scalar coupling between exchanging spins must be taken into consideration, which renders the design of the experiment, as well as analysis and modelling of the data, more complex [259]. A variation of inversion transfer is saturation transfer, where the initial selective pulse saturates the signal of choice, rather than inverting it. The main principles of the analysis are therefore similar [260], and any form of differential perturbation can be used. 4.4.1.2. EXSY.

The acquisition time in EXSY is conventionally labelled as t 2 and corresponds to acquisition time in a standard 1D NMR experiment.

If mixing times are too short, cross-peaks will not be observed (due to the system not being allowed to exchange sufficiently during the period). If mixing times are too long, the experiment will not give reliable kinetic data due to the impact of T 1 relaxation of the species involved in the equilibrium. According to Perrin and Dwyer [262], an optimal mixing time for a two-spin exchanging system is as shown in Eq. ( 16), where T 1 is the relaxation time of the nuclei (assuming these are identical for both spins), and k = k AB + k BA (k AB and k BA are the rate constants of the forward and reverse reactions). These are usually then estimated prior to the EXSY experiment, with further optimisation of s m , if needed, as a matter of trial and error.It is straightforward to observe chemical exchange qualitatively, simply by looking at the spectrum.

        <p>For the previously discussed simple system with two exchanging spins (Scheme 2b), the rate constant, k, can be calculated using Eq. (17), where r = 4x A x B (I AA + I BB )/(I AB + I BA ) -(x A -x B ) 2 in which I is the integrated volume under the appropriate signal, and x A and x B are the mole fractions of spins of the two species A and B, respectively. Unless instrument time is limited, it is advised to conduct a detailed analysis of the integrated volumes (I X ) as a function of s m and determine k using Eq. ( 17). An alternative approach that minimises the experiment length is to run a series of one-dimensional versions of EXSY. The approach is based on carefully choosing a small number of t 1 values (N 2 t 1 values are required if N sites are in exchange), then Fourier transforming the spectra in f 2 only. The resulting set of 1D spectra can be analysed to obtain the kinetic information for the system of interest [263].For the previously discussed simple system with two exchanging spins (Scheme 2b), the rate constant, k, can be calculated using Eq.

        <p>Lastly, it is noteworthy that certain nuclei are more suited for magnetisation transfer and/or EXSY experiments than others. Most importantly, scalar coupling, relaxation times, and the range of chemical shifts involved, play interrelated and significant roles in whether or not any particular nucleus is well suited for these techniques. Nuclei that generally relax more slowly offer the advantage of monitoring the approach to magnetic equilibrium in magnetisation transfer over a longer time period.

        <p>The second common approach to monitoring a dynamic equilibrium system involves line shape analysis. In principle this is a straightforward method for determining rate constants of exchange; however, in practice it can be difficult to separate the effects of exchange from those of relaxation and field inhomogeneity. The applicable timescale is isotope dependent, but for 1 H is typically in the 10-100 ms range. It is based on the appearance of signals in an NMR spectrum depending on nuclear properties of the spin, such as T 2 relaxation time, and on the rates of exchange. In the slow exchange regime, two distinct signals are observed. As exchange becomes faster these broaden, reaching a coalescence point at which they merge into one (the minimum between the signals is no longer observed). As the exchange becomes faster still, the signal becomes averaged and the natural line width is restored, in the fast exchange limit (Fig. 28). The simplest mathematical description of these effects for systems without scalar coupling is provided by the Bloch-McConnell equations [265].The second common approach to monitoring a dynamic equilibrium system involves line shape analysis.

        <p>In practice, line shape analysis is performed over a range of conditions that change the rates of exchange.

        <p>The versatility of NMR as a tool for equilibrium kinetic measurements has already been discussed, and its utility in determining thermodynamic parameters is also very important [266]. NMR titrations can be of great importance in the study of the kinetics of a complex reaction, as the determination of association/isomerisation events in isolation can be used to greatly reduce the number of parameters that require to be fitted in a global kinetic model. While titrations are commonly used in the laboratory as tools for quantitative analysis of the concentration of an analyte, their implementation in NMR studies is often somewhat different. Rather than being utilised to determine the concentration of an analyte using a well-defined equilibrium (or set of equilibria), they are instead used to determine the nature and magnitude of the equilibrium constants themselves. In this section, we discuss the study of reversible molecular associations, using three examples: a single reversible association, a competitive association, and a cooperative association. A common experimental design for an NMR titration is one in which the concentration of a single component is varied systematically and the system response is plotted as a function of this variation. Depending on the rates of the equilibria, the response might be a change in the chemical shift of a key resonance, or a change in the integral of that resonance.The versatility of NMR as a tool for equilibrium kinetic measurements has already been discussed, and its utility in determining thermodynamic parameters is also very important [266].

A large excess of B is then dissolved in a sample of solution I to give solution II, in which A is essentially only present in the form AÁB. The large excess of B in solution II ensures that small volumes of it can be added to solution I in the NMR titration, to give data that spans a large range of speciation, with a manageable total sample volume in the NMR tube. As large numbers of solution transfers are typically conducted in an NMR titration, great care must be taken to ensure volumetric accuracy in any dilutions, and minimisation of solvent evaporation.

        <p>Although there is no time dependence in mathematical models, the stability of substrates and the rate of adjustment of a system to a new equilibrium must always be considered when designing a titration experiment. If the system is still equilibrating at the time of measurement, then the integral data extracted will not reflect the equilibrium populations and will therefore introduce large errors in the data. For this reason, it is useful to repeat measurements for systems in slow exchange and compare integrals to verify that the system has reached equilibrium before proceeding with the next aliquot of solution II. Removing part of the solution already in the NMR tube leads to errors due to solvent evaporation/transfer loss and should be avoided if possible. We advise use of specialised titration NMR tubes (Fig. 2d).

        <p>The first point to consider when fitting data to a model is the functionality and symmetry of the compounds being studied, and thus the likely stoichiometry of association. If the stoichiometry of association is 1:1 then a simple bimolecular association, which gives a quadratic response curve (Fig. 29a) will usually give a good fit for the data. If a number of identical association sites are avail- able, then models with stoichiometry 2:1 or higher must be considered. The first model to examine in such a case is a noncooperative 2:1 termolecular association (single equilibrium) which has a steeper initial response (Fig. 29b) than the quadratic curve of 1:1 association (Fig. 29a). If the non-cooperative 2:1 model does not fit, then the simple single equilibrium association should be split into multiple binding events, whose equilibrium constants are linked by a cooperativity constant (a; Eq. ( 29)). Fitting of the cooperativity constant (Fig. 29c) should allow the model to incorporate systematic deviations if cooperative binding is the cause. In the case of a positively cooperative system, the data will have sigmoidal character, with an initial lag in uptake compared to the non-cooperative fit, followed by a large increase as more guest is added. A negatively cooperative association will have a faster uptake but also an earlier plateau when compared to a noncooperative model of the same stoichiometry.The first point to consider when fitting data to a model is the functionality and symmetry of the compounds being studied, and thus the likely stoichiometry of association.

        <p>Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR experiments can be used to determine the translational self-diffusion coefficients, D T , of molecules in solution. Because D T depends on molecular size, shape, conformational flexibility, and density, its measurement can be very valuable for probing interactions and intermediates in mechanistic studies. Such experiments invariably employ a diffusionordered spectroscopy (DOSY) display method [271]. DOSY allows one to probe the structure, interactions, and reactions of small to medium sized molecules [272][273][274], in a way that is complementary to other approaches; see for example Case Studies 2, 12 and 15. DOSY can be applied to mechanistic work in a qualitative, or quantitative manner.

Molecules will of course diffuse randomly in the time between the two PFGs, and the root mean square displacement z rms of a molecule along one dimension from some initial position after a time t is given by Eq.

The greater the extent of vertical mixing, the greater the attenuation of the observed signal intensity, I, relative to I 0 , the signal in the absence of the paired PFGs.In a typical DOSY experiment, a one-dimensional PFG is applied along the z-axis, after the standard 90°excitation, resulting in the phases of the nuclear spins being dependent on their position in the sample.

        <p>The self-diffusion coefficient, D T , varies with solution viscosity, which in turn depends on the identity of the solvent, the concentration of the sample, and the identity and concentration of any co-solutes. In general, greater D T values will be observed for more dilute samples, and in samples prepared with low viscosity solvents. For mixtures of multiple compounds -and particularly during the selection of appropriate internal diffusion standards (Section 4.6.2.3) -it is crucial to consider the possibility of intermolecular complexation and self-association, and D T values that change significantly with concentration are diagnostic of such interactions. In addition to viscosity, the choice of solvent also determines susceptibility to convection. In general, a more viscous solvent with high density and low thermal expansion coefficients should be selected to suppress convective flow. However, for mechanistic studies it is essential that DOSY experiments are conducted in the same solvent, or one of the range of solvents, as the reaction under investigation.The self-diffusion coefficient, D T , varies with solution viscosity, which in turn depends on the identity of the solvent, the concentration of the sample, and the identity and concentration of any co-solutes.

Such experiments usually involve the incorporation of a stable, normally naturally low-abundant, isotope(s) into a reaction component -for example in a substrate, intermediate, catalyst, ligand, solvent etc. The fate, or influence, of the isotope is then determined so as to help elucidate mechanistic information. Chemical reactions of synthetic relevance are often complex, with many involving extended networks of coupled reactions -some slow, some fast, some reversible, some irreversible. In such networks it is often possible for multiple steps to be affected by a single isotopic substitution in the starting material. Nevertheless, when deployed judiciously, isotopic substitution experiments afford mechanistic insights of unsurpassed detail and subtlety, offering a direct, experimentally determinable outcome from key transition states in complex reactions, and providing robust quantitative benchmarks to support theoretical studies. NMR spectroscopy is uniquely suited to the monitoring of isotopically-enriched (or depleted) reactions in the solution phase, on account of its capacity to distinguish molecules that differ by virtue of isotopic constitution (isotopologues) and isotopic connectivity/configuration (isotopomers).

        <p>Sites of isotopic substitution are often employed as tracers (labels) during reaction monitoring [300]. In these cases, isotopic substitutions are made at selected sites within a substrate, and the connectivity of the label is tracked during the course of a reaction. In this way it is possible to trace the origin and destination of specific nuclei in a reaction, when this would otherwise remain unknown or ambiguous. This approach is particularly useful for distinguishing competing reaction pathways that lead to degenerate products (e.g. migrations), and therefore also for the investigation of stereochemistry. Isotopic substitution can also be used as a tool for spectroscopically resolving otherwise degenerate molecules during a reaction, by virtue of induced isotopic shifts or changes in scalar coupling.

By combining multiple 2 H/ 13 C crossover experiments with 29 Si{ 1 H} NMR spectroscopy [305], a range of conclusions were drawn about the mechanism of this fundamental process.

This was shown to be consistent with a process in which each molecule of product is generated from components of two separate molecules of the substrate, via two sequential turnovers of a 'two silicon cycle'. Kinetic simulations were able to reproduce almost exactly the distribution of product isotopologues observed by 29 Si{ 1 H} NMR. It is important to note that the presence of both 1 J Si-C coupling and c-2 H isotope shifts was pivotal for the NMR spectral resolution of the four products.The atom-accountancy approach has proved useful to us in a wide variety of mechanistic studies.

For example, if an intermediate is detected in an in situ NMR investigation, and the structure of the intermediate is ambiguous, the presence or absence of specific scalar couplings over single or sequential bonds can provide definitive evidence of bond cleavage or bond generation, both inter-and intra-molecular. In a recent study of the [2,3]rearrangement of 11, catalysed by benzotetramisole 12, a shortlived intermediate was detected by in situ 19 F NMR and by in situ 13 C{ 1 H} NMR using an 13 C-isotopically-enriched substrate.

        <p>Isotopic substitution typically leads to small but measurable perturbations in the chemical shifts of nearby nuclei [306]. These perturbations are termed isotope shifts and denoted by n Dd x (I H , I L ), where Dd x specifies the change in chemical shift of a reporter nucleus X that arises from isotopic substitution, I H and I L denote the two isotopes (heavy and light) being exchanged, and n denotes the number of intervening bonds between the reporter nucleus X and the site of isotopic substitution, Eq. (44). Primary isotope shifts arise when the reporter nucleus X and site of isotopic substitution are one and the same (i.e. n = 0), whereas secondary isotope shifts arise when n &gt; 0. Primary isotope shifts are thus only possible for elements with at least two NMR active nuclei.Isotopic substitution typically leads to small but measurable perturbations in the chemical shifts of nearby nuclei [306].

        <p>The equilibrium geometry of molecules (the global minimum on the potential energy surface) is generally regarded as being isotopically independent. Isotopic substitution does, however, change the vibrational frequencies of a molecule on the potential energy surface, and therefore the time-averaged molecular geometry [307,308]. It is these small, time-averaged structural changes that lead to perturbations in chemical shifts. Structural perturbations, and therefore isotope shifts, are largest when isotopic substitution is made at a site whose motion contributes to strongly coupled anharmonic modes.The equilibrium geometry of molecules (the global minimum on the potential energy surface) is generally regarded as being isotopically independent.

        <p>There are several ways in which isotope shifts can be leveraged during reaction monitoring by NMR. Exploiting isotope shifts is often the only way to detect the presence -and thereby quantify the incorporation -of isotopes that are either NMR silent ( 18 O, 34 S) or quadrupolar with very fast T 1 relaxation ( 33 S, 35 Cl); for this reason isotope shifts can be indispensable when measuring heavynuclei KIEs, see for example Case Study 3. Strategic isotopic substitutions in the vicinity of NMR active nuclei can also be deployed more generally to distinguish otherwise degenerate molecules, and to do so without perturbing their reactivity in any measurable way; such strategies are of great utility in the determination of KIEs by pairwise intermolecular competition experiments, and in the monitoring of self-exchange kinetics in degenerate reactions.There are several ways in which isotope shifts can be leveraged during reaction monitoring by NMR.

        <p>Kinetic isotope effects are generally reported as a ratio of rate coefficients (k), with the numerator being the rate coefficient for the lighter isotopologue, e.g. k H /k D , k 12C /k 13C , k 16O /k 18O , etc. Normal kinetic isotope effects (nKIEs) are observed when the lighter isotopologue reacts faster (e.g. k H /k D &gt; 1); inverse kinetic isotope effects (iKIEs) are defined conversely (e.g. k H /k D &lt; 1). Kinetic isotope effects are often further classified as primary or secondary. Primary effects (PKIEs) arise when a bond involving the isotopic label is cleaved in, or prior to, the rate-determining (absolute rates), substrate-committing (intermolecular competition), or product-determining (intramolecular competition) transition state (vide infra); secondary effects (SKIEs) arise when the isotopic label is in close proximity to, but not directly involved in, a bond that is cleaved during the reaction. Isotopic substitution in the solvent can also lead to changes in the rates of chemical processes and positions of equilibria; these changes are described as solvent isotope effects (SIEs). The largest SIEs typically arise in protic solvents, and can be induced by changes in the solvation of transition states, differences in gross solvent viscosity, changes in solvent autoionisation (and thus bulk pH and protonation states of substrate) and chemical exchange between a substrate, intermediate or transition state (OH, NH, SH) and the protic solvent.

This approach demands less NMR instrument time and will often give reasonable results for moderate to large KIEs, provided the reaction is run to a sufficiently high fractional conversion, usually F &gt; 0.75. For more accurate results, particularly when low magnitude KIEs are to be determined, it can be useful to continuously monitor the reaction, so that a series of fractional conversions, F, and substrate ratios, R, can be obtained over the course of the reaction. The KIE can then be determined by non-linear regression of Eq. ( 59), a rearranged form of the Bigeleisen-Wolfsberg equation Eq. (58). When isotopically labelled substrates are synthetically accessible, this method is recommended for the determination of KIEs by intermolecular competition, and especially for SKIEs and heavy-atom KIEs.There are a number of ways in which this equation can be used to determine the KIE, e.g. k H /k D .

        <p>As is evident in Fig. 32, the substrate ratio R will be most sensitive to a KIE as F approaches 1, so in principle monitoring reactions to higher conversions should permit the determination of KIEs with progressively increasing precision by NMR. However, this only remains true in the limiting scenario that R and F can be determined with arbitrary accuracy. In practice, the decay in S/N with increasing conversion imposes a practical bound on the precision with which a KIE can be determined by intermolecular competi-tion. Whilst the exact limit will depend upon the mode of detection, extent of spectral congestion, and initial concentration of the competing substrates, quantitative NMR monitoring of reactions beyond conversions of 95% becomes difficult.As is evident in Fig. 32, the substrate ratio R will be most sensitive to a KIE as F approaches 1, so in principle monitoring reactions to higher conversions should permit the determination of KIEs with progressively increasing precision by NMR.

        <p>The final method for determining KIEs makes use of a single substrate comprising two (or more) homotopic reactive sites, e.g. A H D , that are different only by virtue of their isotopic constitution. Thus, a reagent (B) or other process, must select between two (or more) isotopically distinct but otherwise identical sites in a single substrate, Eqs. ( 67) and (68). In such a case the overall KIE can therefore be determined from the ratio or distribution of product isotopologues, and provided the product does not undergo further reaction, this can be measured at any point during the course of the reaction.The final method for determining KIEs makes use of a single substrate comprising two (or more) homotopic reactive sites, e.g. A H D , that are different only by virtue of their isotopic constitution.

        <p>Again, the detection of a KIE by intramolecular competition does not necessarily report on the rate-determining transition state for the overall reaction. Thus, for example, if the step during which the isotopes are kinetically differentiated occurs after the rate-determining transition state, a large KIE may be still measured. Because the isotope selection always occurs within a single substrate, and not between two populations of isotopologues, intramolecular KIEs are also insensitive to processes that lead to the irreversible consumption of a substrate prior to bond forma-tion/cleavage at the site of interest. An important consideration is that the presence of one isotope can affect the reaction of the other. In other words the net KIE can be a combination of, for example, a PKIE for the isotope lost in the bond-cleaving event, and a SKIE arising from the isotope(s) that remain. This effect is evident for example in the deprotonation (CAH versus CAD) of ArCH 2 D [314]. 5.3.3.4. Chemical considerations. High quality data is required for the determination of KIEs, and this will only be obtained if the reaction of interest fulfils certain criteria, which vary between the various methods of KIE measurement. If the KIEs are determined by the consumption of the substrate, they will only be reliable in the absence of competing side reactions. Ideally, the substrate should be converted to the product or product mixture with perfect efficiency. Thus, it should not be consumed by other processes, including those that arise from the liberated product (s) or from intermediates. Subsequent decomposition of the product should not influence the measured KIE, provided that product generation is irreversible. Isotopic scrambling between, or within, isotopologues, or between the labelled substrate and other reagents, will impact on the measurement, and ideally should be eliminated completely. This is particularly important in the determination of 1 H/ 2 H KIEs, and should always be considered in cases where degenerate self-exchange between substrates and products might normally proceed unnoticed. For intermolecular competition reactions, the Bigeleisen-Wolfsberg equation can, in principle, only be employed if the reaction proceeds with a first-order dependence on the competing isotopologues in the step in which they are kinetically differentiated.Again, the detection of a KIE by intramolecular competition does not necessarily report on the rate-determining transition state for the overall reaction.

        <p>Isotopic entrainment involves the analysis of the flux (entrainment) of a small quantity of isotopically labelled species into, or through, a reaction sequence involving unlabelled or differently labelled reactants. It can be used to interrogate the kinetic behaviour of intermediate species detected during stoichiometric and catalytic reactions, and with careful design, establish the reversibility of formation of all species in the process: substrates, intermediates, products and side products. The archetypal kinetic profile of an intermediate, from initial accumulation to steadystate evolution and eventual depletion, is not necessarily indicative of its role in a productive reaction or catalytic cycle. For example, species that are peripheral to the primary process can often exhibit qualitatively similar kinetic behaviour to species that are directly involved. In an isotopic entrainment experiment, the isotopically labelled substrate or intermediate is spiked into the active reaction, and the flux of the newly introduced isotope amongst all key species is then monitored continuously. The isotopic incorporation profiles, in conjunction with kinetic simulation, can be used to decipher whether an intermediate is intrinsic to a process, or is peripheral to it, i.e. generated via an unproductive side reaction or ''off-cycle" event in a catalytic cycle [28,32,324,325].Isotopic entrainment involves the analysis of the flux (entrainment) of a small quantity of isotopically labelled species into, or through, a reaction sequence involving unlabelled or differently labelled reactants.

Subsequent direct or indirect NMR analysis of the resultant isotope ratios (%), as a function of reaction progress, with the aid of kinetic modelling, establishes the component chronology and enables evaluation of mechanistic hypotheses. To illustrate the concept, we consider a simple catalytic process involving conversion of substrate into a product, with a species 'I', suspected to be an intermediate, being detected during the reaction. The reaction is initiated and, after being allowed to run to low conversion, usually about 15% conversion of the substrate (Sub), an identical amount of a labelled form of the substrate (Sub*) is added, and the % isotope incorporation in Sub/Sub*; I/I*; and Prod/Prod* repeatedly analysed in situ by NMR spectroscopy until conversion is complete. A number of limiting regimes can be envisaged; here we just consider regimes A, B, and C, Fig. 35. At the point of introduction of Sub* (see dashed vertical line in Fig. 35) the isotope ratio in the total substrate pool is raised from 0% to an amount reflecting the Sub* added in relation to the Sub remaining.The isotopic entrainment experiment involves a rapid isotopic perturbation of the reaction, usually by manual addition of the isotopically labelled component.

        <p>Careful examination of satellite peaks in NMR spectra can be immensely useful for the assignment of the geometry of molecules [331]. For example, it is not possible to confirm cis-or trans-double bond geometry in symmetrical stilbenes and analogous alkenes from the main signals in their 1 H NMR spectra alone. However, approximately 2% of the molecule will be present as the isotopologue in which one of the two alkene carbons is 13 C.

        <p>In 19 F{ 1 H} NMR spectra of organofluorine compounds, the main 12 C- 19 F signals which appear are accompanied by a smaller doublet for the 13 C- 19 F satellites. The sensitivity increase, due to improved signal-to-noise ratio for the satellites in comparison to the analogous peak in a 13 C spectrum, allows the 12 C/ 13 C isotope ratio to be determined by integrating the satellite peaks. In circumstances where representative integrals for the satellites are unobtainable, for example due to interference from the parent peak, a technique used to generate NMR spectra in which the 12 C signals are suppressed may be applied. Multiple-quantum filtered (MQF) 19 F { 1 H} NMR spectra enable accurate satellite integrals to be obtained, Fig. 37. This strategy has been very effectively developed and applied by Kwan and Jacobsen in a detailed study of concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions [323]. For example, in Fig. 37, the right hand 13 C- 19 F satellite at the benzylic position (Ar 13 CH 2 F, not shown) can be integrated against the right hand 13 C- 19 F satellite of the CF 3 group (shown), using the latter as an internal reference during conversion of ArCH 2 Br into ArCH 2 F. The change in the integrated ratio (R/R 0 ) as a function of fractional conversion, F, (Section 5.3.3.2) then allows the 13 C KIE to be determined for the benzyl bromide substitution process. Although, in principle, the quantitation may be affected by transverse relaxation during the pulse sequence, the technique was validated by comparison of the 13 C KIE determined using the MQF 19 F{ 1 H} NMR technique with the Singleton method (Section 5.3.4), which was found to be 1.059 by both methods [323].In 19 F{ 1 H} NMR spectra of organofluorine compounds, the main 12 C- 19 F signals which appear are accompanied by a smaller doublet for the 13 C- 19 F satellites.

        <p>There are situations in which the suppression of satellite signals is desirable. An abundance of satellite signals and hence likely signal overlap can mask minor impurities in complex spectra. NMR experiments such as DISPEL can be implemented to remove satellites where necessary [180]. Conversely, experiments such as INADEQUATE can be used to selectively study satellites [336]. Natural abundance distributions can be determined by NMR spectroscopy, using the natural abundance of one compound to provide a reference for another. The technique is particularly useful for quantifying the enrichment of a sample which has been isotopically labelled. This strategy was applied to evaluate the 10 B incorporation in vinylboronic acid pinacol ester, using natural abundance (80.2/19.8; 10 B/ 11 B) potassium 4fluorophenyltrifluoroborate as a reference, and superimposing the 11 B and 10 B NMR spectra [28], see Case Study 13.There are situations in which the suppression of satellite signals is desirable. An abundance of satellite signals and hence likely signal overlap can mask minor impurities in complex spectra. NMR experiments such as DISPEL can be implemented to remove satellites where necessary [180]. Conversely, experiments such as INADEQUATE can be used to selectively study satellites [336].

        <p>Low signal-to-noise ratio is an inherent problem for lowabundance NMR-active nuclei; 13 C for example has a natural abundance of 1.1%, and 29 Si is &lt;5% abundant. Enrichment of samples by means of isotopic labelling can be a simple way to address this. For example, poor S/N in a 13 C{ 1 H} NMR spectroscopic study of the dimerisation reaction of carbene 30 to 31 made kinetic analysis challenging. Installing a 13 C label (99%) on the carbene carbon increased the effective concentration of the process being analysed by a factor of &gt;86, and revealed much useful information about the mechanism and side products (32) of this reaction, Fig. 38 [314].Low signal-to-noise ratio is an inherent problem for lowabundance NMR-active nuclei; 13 C for example has a natural abundance of 1.1%, and 29 Si is &lt;5% abundant.

        <p>The 15 Case Studies below have been selected to provide illustrations of the different aspects of the various approaches for the application of NMR in mechanistic investigation that have been covered in Sections 1-5. They are based on recent publications from the authors' group and from others. None of them are comprehensive descriptions of the work, nor do they focus on the overall mechanistic conclusions, or the full background that stimulated the investigation; the reader is encouraged to go to the primary cited publication for further details if they are intrigued. Instead, each case study outlines one or more of the main mechanistic or technical questions, and how NMR spectroscopy allowed these to be answered. The focus of the discussion in each case is on the practical details of how these key experiments were conducted, most often using information drawn from the Supporting Information to the primary publication. The aim of this approach is to give the reader a sense of how the problems were actually tackled, rather than simply summarising the conclusions from each study. Table 3 provides a list of all of the major topics discussed in Sections 1-5 and indicates in which of the case studies these techniques have been applied. Thus if one is interested in a specific technique, the key case studies to read, and the reference to the primary publication, can easily be located. The Case Studies highlight the extremely versatile nature of the NMR technique, allowing exquisite details to be elucidated from relatively small volumes of reactions, under the 'normal' reaction conditions relevant to their application.

The remaining solution was then loaded into the reagent syringe of the rapid quench-flow apparatus and the thermostat set to 70 °C. The second reagent syringe was primed with a solution of KOH in dioxane/water (1/1), and the quench syringe primed with aqueous HCl (large excess over the KOH). Once the system had thermally equilibrated to 70 °C, the reagents were driven through the mixer and the control software set to allow reaction ageing time periods ranging from 2 ms to 30 s, depending on the boronic acid, before 'instant' automated quench by the HCl.

        <p>Twenty of the thirty arylboronic acids (33-52) proved stable enough for rapidly conducted 11 B{ 1 H} NMR pH titrations. In each case, the arylboronic acid was dissolved in dioxane/water (1/1) to give a 0.05 M solution, which was stirred and heated to 70 °C. While monitoring using a pH meter, KOH was added in small volumes to increase the pH by 0.5 pH units, between pH 7. Of the remaining arylboronic acids, 2,6-fluorophenylboronate acid (56) was chosen as an electron-deficient system that primarily follows the faster pathway, I B (Scheme 9). An analogous KIE study was conducted, but using the rapid quench flow NMR protocol, vide supra. The resulting absolute rate KIE, k H /k D , was 1.00, indicating that proton transfer is not involved in the rate-limiting step. The partitioning KIE was low, but not 1.00.

        <p>The mechanistic proposal (pathway I B , Scheme 9) was explored by 10/11 B and 12/13 C heavy-atom KIE experiments. The former used two competition experiments (Scheme 10), both of which suggested that there was not the expected primary B-KIE. However, a possible explanation lay in an equal but opposite secondary isotope effect (SKIE) caused by rehybridization of the boron during the arylboronate to boric acid (B(OH) 3 ) conversion at stage one, the RLS, of pathway I B . An analogous equilibrium isotope effect (EIE) would also be expected for arylboronate/arylboronic acid interconversion, and this was probed by competitive 19 F NMR titra-tions, Scheme 11, to gain supporting evidence. From these experiments a significant inverse secondary 10/11 B EIE was determined (1.02), a value which is sufficient to offset the expected normal boron PKIE in the RLS for pathway I B .The mechanistic proposal (pathway I B , Scheme 9) was explored by 10/11 B and 12/13 C heavy-atom KIE experiments.

        <p>A 13 C KIE is also expected to attend C-B cleavage in pathway I B , and in this case was probed using the Singleton method (Section 5.3.4). Thus, a solution of 2,6-difluorophenylboronic acid in 1/1 dioxane/water containing TFA as an internal standard was warmed to 27 °C, and a solution of excess KOH added. After 77 min ($96% conversion) the reaction was quenched and the 13 C-enriched unreacted boronic acid (56) isolated. However, 13 C NMR analysis of the key carbon was strongly affected by the quadrupolar relaxation broadening caused by the adjacent boron. The boronic acid was therefore redissolved in dioxane/water, added to a J Young valve NMR tube, excess KOH added, and the tube shaken vigorously to effect complete protodeboronation. In a separate J Young valve NMR tube a sample of the unreacted (i.e. non- 13 C enriched) boronic acid was analogously protodeboronated. Both samples were analysed by 19 F NMR until protodeboronation was complete. This allowed indirect analysis of the boronic acid 56, by 13 C DEPT-55 analysis of the cleanly in situ generated 1,3-difluorobenzene products 69. The 12 C/ 13 C PKIE value for the ipso carbon (C1 in 56) was determined to be 1.029, consistent with the primary KIE calculated computationally (DFT) for pathway I B .A 13 C KIE is also expected to attend C-B cleavage in pathway I B , and in this case was probed using the Singleton method (Section 5.3.4).

        <p>In preliminary 1 H NMR studies it had been found that there was good separation of the peaks, allowing for all of the major species to be clearly followed. The team used the following protocol for their analysis. Firstly, they calibrated their NMR spectrometer probe temperature using the methanol thermometer technique. This involved determining the 1 H NMR chemical shift of a 4% sample of MeOH in CD 3 OD, for which reference calibration curves of chemical shift difference between Me and OH, versus temperature, have been published [50]. After calibration, they charged a solution of the EDA (0.47 M) and their chosen internal standard of 1,1,2,2tetrachloroethane (1 lL) to a J Young valve NMR tube. This was submitted to the spectrometer and tuning, locking, shimming, 90°pulse calibration and T 1 measurement were carried out at À40 °C. The sample was then ejected from the NMR spectrometer and put into a dry-ice acetone bath at À78 °C. Next, the Pd initiator (75, 9.5 mM) was injected into the NMR tube, to give a total volume of 736 lL, and the NMR tube submitted back to the NMR spectrometer. The data collection was started (t 0 ) once the lock signal stabilised, and the dead time between resubmission and reaching the desired À40 °C was recorded. A series of NMR spectra were recorded over 1 h and the resulting data modelled in plots of [conc] vs t, for both the EDA and palladium dimer. The modelled data revealed that the dimer decayed with first order kinetics, and that the EDA had a more complex first/second order relationship -findings consistent with their proposed dinuclear mechanism.In preliminary 1 H NMR studies it had been found that there was good separation of the peaks, allowing for all of the major species to be clearly followed.

        <p>An interesting finding from their in situ kinetics study was the migration of the methyl group from one of the acetate groups in the palladium dimer. Utilising DOSY (Section 4.6) they were able to identify that the new peak in the NMR arises from the acetate becoming attached to the chain end of the polymer, further supporting the mechanistic hypotheses regarding initiation events.An interesting finding from their in situ kinetics study was the migration of the methyl group from one of the acetate groups in the palladium dimer.

        <p>To conclude their studies Toste and collaborators looked to elucidate comparative rates of initiation for the acetate complex 75, Scheme 12, versus the chloride bridged complex used in previous work, complex 76. The dead time in the VT NMR studies outlined above meant key data was missing for the first 200 s, during which the initiator was mostly consumed. This aspect was addressed using the rapid injection method (Section 2.4.4.1). Firstly, 400 lL from a stock solution of the initiator (3.69 lM in toluene-d 8 ) was charged into an NMR tube. Separately a solution of the EDA was prepared (0.92 mM) with 1,4-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene as internal standard and transferred to the injection reservoir in the RI-NMR equipment. The NMR tube was then inserted into the NMR spectrometer with the cap removed and under a flow of N 2 , and the tube cooled to À20 °C. The injection system was lowered into the NMR spectrometer and allowed to cool over a period of 10 s, after which 200 lL of the EDA solution was injected at a rate of 150 lL/s. The reaction was monitored in situ from the point of injection via 1 H NMR, with a spectrum recorded every 19 s over twelve minutes. From the data obtained, Toste and collaborators were able to determine that initiator 75 was much more effective than 76. They were also able to derive information about the relative propensity for the two initiators to dimerise rather than polymerise the EDA from the RI-NMR experiments. These observations, along with the support of DFT calculations, allowed the proposal of a dinuclear mechanism, in which both Pd centres play a role.To conclude their studies Toste and collaborators looked to elucidate comparative rates of initiation for the acetate complex 75, Scheme 12, versus the chloride bridged complex used in previous work, complex 76.

        <p>This study highlights the substantial increase in insight available by application of specialist techniques. The use of VT-NMR allowed elucidation of the kinetic orders, and gave important general mechanistic information. By employing the RI-NMR technique, processes occurring at the very beginning of the reaction were analysed, under carefully controlled temperature conditions, revealing information that would be missed by standard in situ monitoring. Overall, the in situ NMR study yielded important information about the relative activity of the two catalysts 75 and 76, and provided additional understanding regarding which more readily undergoes the undesired dimerization.This study highlights the substantial increase in insight available by application of specialist techniques.

        <p>Over the last decade, there has been much interest in use of the reagent trimethyl(trifluoromethyl)silane (TMSCF 3 ) for CF 3 and CF 2 transfer, including applications at industrial scale. The Lloyd-Jones group recently published two mechanistic studies on the reagent, exploring CF 3 transfer to ketones and aldehydes and CF 2 transfer to alkenes. Both studies utilised a wide range of techniques, especially 19 F NMR, to elucidate detailed information.Over the last decade, there has been much interest in use of the reagent trimethyl(trifluoromethyl)silane (TMSCF 3 ) for CF 3 and CF 2 transfer, including applications at industrial scale.

        <p>The study began by using in situ 19 F NMR to characterise the reaction of 4-fluoroacetophenone (77) with TMSCF 3 , initiated by Bu 4 NF (TBAF, Scheme 13). 200 lL of a stock solution containing 77 and the internal standard (fluorobenzene) in THF was added to an NMR tube, followed by a further 200 lL of a stock solution of TMSCF 3 in THF. A rubber septum was used to seal the NMR tube, allowing for later addition of the TBAF initiator without the system being exposed to air. The NMR tube was loaded into the NMR spectrometer at 300 K and the sample was shimmed, tuned and the first spectrum obtained (t = 0). The sample was then ejected and 50 lL from a stock solution of TBAF in THF was rapidly injected, using a microsyringe with the needle inserted through the rubber septum of the NMR tube. The NMR tube was vigorous shaken (vertically) during the addition, and again once the needle was removed, to ensure full mixing. The NMR tube was resubmitted to the spectrometer, shimmed, tuned, and a spectrum obtained. The time between the TBAT being added and the first spectrum being obtained was recorded by a stopwatch, to include as an adjustment when later analysing concentration vs time as recorded by the spectrometer. Spectra were taken at regular intervals, over time periods that depended on the specific reaction conditions. Three side-products were evident in the 19 F NMR spectra, and identified as fluoroform (CF 3 H, 81), a Scheme 12.

        <p>Y. Ben-Tal, P.J. Boaler, Harvey J.A. Dale Having identified the product, and side-products, spectra were stacked and each peak integrated, using the fluorobenzene internal standard to determine absolute concentrations of each species. The results were found to vary between batches of TBAF, and so this was replaced with [Ph 3 SiF 2 ][Bu 4 N] ('TBAT'), an anhydrous initiator that gave consistent results and much faster reactions. Using the in situ 19 F NMR method, the effects of potential contaminants in the TMSCF 3 were tested by addition of a series of possible ''inhibitors", about 200 s after initiation, and then resubmitting the NMR tube to the spectrometer to analyse the change in rate reaction. The in situ method was also employed to determine how the identity of the CF 3 source (comparing Me 3 SiCF 3 with Et 3 SiCF 3 and (iPr) 3 SiCF 3 ) affected the rate of reaction and generation of enol ether 79 and analogues.Y.

        <p>Whilst the initial in situ studies gave useful information regarding the effects of different initiators, reagents and inhibitors, detailed kinetic analysis remained elusive due to the fast rate at which the reaction initiated and proceeded to completion. Thus, stopped-flow (SF-NMR) (Section 2.4.4.2) was employed, allowing detailed analysis of the first 5-100 s of the reaction, allowing efficient control of mixing and temperature. For the reaction of interest, Scheme 14, classic SF-NMR (Fig. 12a) with a fixed-ratio two reservoir system would require a very large quantity of each component (R 3 SiCF 3 , ketone, and initiator) and a lengthy procedure for flushing out the previous samples in the reservoirs and flow lines between runs, to fully evaluate the kinetics. Instead, a triple reservoir, variable ratio SF-NMR system (Fig. 39) was employed. For the three-component reaction (Scheme 14) this required just four stock solutions to be prepared.Whilst the initial in situ studies gave useful information regarding the effects of different initiators, reagents and inhibitors, detailed kinetic analysis remained elusive due to the fast rate at which the reaction initiated and proceeded to completion.

        <p>The following protocol was followed for the SF-NMR experiments. A stock solution of TMSCF 3 and ketone in THF was prepared and transferred into a Schott reagent bottle, which was capped with a three-valve cap with threaded ports. A TBAT stock solution was also prepared in the same manner. A further Schott bottle containing a 'wash solution' of TMSCF 3 and TBAT was prepared, and this then was used to dehydrate the flow lines in the SF-NMR system prior to use in this very water-sensitive reaction. Next, the SF-NMR flow-cell assembly was lowered into the NMR spectrometer and shimming and tuning performed. The three syringe drives were each loaded with the appropriate reagent and flushed through the system, followed by anhydrous THF. The syringes were loaded again and kinetic studies were run using a 600 lL shot volume, a 1 mL s À1 flow rate, and a spectrum acquisition time of 0.5 s with 1 s relaxation delay.

        <p>Using this system, the initial rate of reaction, as a function of the concentrations of all three components (TMSCF 3 , ketone, and TBAT), was rapidly and efficiently analysed. For TBAT and ketone, plots of initial rate vs initial concentration gave positive straightline correlations, indicative of first-order dependence on both components. However, for TMSCF 3 initial rate vs reciprocal initial concentration gave a positive straight-line correlation, indicative of inverse first-order with respect to TMSCF 3 ; i.e. the reagent is an inhibitor of the overall process.Using this system, the initial rate of reaction, as a function of the concentrations of all three components (TMSCF 3 , ketone, and TBAT), was rapidly and efficiently analysed.

        <p>SF-NMR analysis using 10 mol% TBAT allowed identification of a siliconate intermediate, [(CF 3 ) 2 SiMe 3 ] -, and by interleaving a combination of datasets obtained with varying delays between the reaction being triggered and the first spectrum, temporal concentration data was obtained for the full reaction evolution, acquiring 30 data points at 0.29 s intervals over a pseudo time period of 8.7 s. The short-lived siliconate intermediate, [(CF 3 ) 2 SiMe 3 ] -, was shown to be generated in direct proportion to the TBAT, and to be in a very rapid dynamic equilibrium with TMSCF 3 and an undetected low concentration of a highly reactive CF 3 anionoid. The latter process gave rise to dynamic-line broadening of the siliconate species, which was constant throughout the reaction. However, for the TMSCF 3 the dynamic line-broadening was found to develop as the reaction proceeded, and the TMSCF 3 concentration was depleted. This dynamic line-broadening was successfully simulated using a three-spin exchange process in which TMSCF 3 and the siliconate are in rapid dissociative equilibrium with a k ex rate ranging from approximately 180 s À1 to 2325 s À1 between 2 and 22 °C, Fig. 40. The data for k ex at the various temperatures was used in an Eyring analysis, plotting ln(k ex /T) vs 1/T, to give DG à and TDS à for the dissociation (82 ? 84 + CF 3 -) at 27 °C, the temperature at which the kinetics of the CF 3 transfer reaction were studied. This data could not be obtained directly due to the siliconate signal being indistinguishable from the baseline at this temperature.SF-NMR analysis using 10 mol% TBAT allowed identification of a siliconate intermediate, [(CF 3 ) 2 SiMe 3 ] -, and by interleaving a combination of datasets obtained with varying delays between the reaction being triggered and the first spectrum, temporal concentration data was obtained for the full reaction evolution, acquiring 30 data points at 0.29 s intervals over a pseudo time period of 8.7 s.

The log of the ratio of the two difluorocyclopropanation products (determined by integrating the diastereoisotopic CF 2 signals) was found to correlate with r + , affording a small negative q + value.

Experimental data, obtained by SF-NMR Fig. 39, is coloured red, the fitted data is coloured black. The CF 3 anionoid is not detected. Under these conditions (large excess of TMSCF 3 , as evident from 13 C-satellites, which are not included in the fitting), the lineshape of the siliconate is only dependent on the dissociation rate (k ex ). As the temperature is raised, decomposition leads to a mixture of perfluoroalkenes and perfluorocarbanions, dominated by [C 11 F 23 ] À . the TMSCF 3 is an indirect source of CF 2 . However, the mechanism for the liberation of the CF 2 required further mechanistic study of both the NaI and TBAT initiated systems by in situ 19 F NMR (Scheme 18). A wide range of experiments were conducted. These included (i) testing the stability of the system in the absence of one of each of the components; (ii) understanding the inhibitory effects of various additives by charging in these compounds during the in situ analysis; (iii) evaluating the effect of different solvents and determining what effect changing the cation and anion of the initiator had on the system; and (iv) analysis of the evolution of the difluorocyclopropanation product versus the TMSF reaction co-product, in the form of a 'concentration-concentration plot'. Indeed using this single in situ 19 F NMR analysis technique, large amounts of data were extracted, and supported by detailed computational studies, of a wide range of mechanistic hypotheses, that eliminated various possibilities, including radical and cationic chain reactions, and the liberation of CF 2 directly from TMSCF 3 . It was eventually concluded that CF 2 generation from TMSCF 3 proceeds by an anionic chain reaction in which a CF 3 anionoid (Fig. 40) is again a key intermediate.

        <p>A combination of online flow NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, inline liquid chromatography and head-space mass spectrometry were used to provide complementary information about the reaction. Whilst in principle data for each of these techniques could be acquired independently, measuring the data simultaneously using NMR, UV-Vis flow cells, HPLC and headspace-MS sampling in a single reaction vessel, allowed direct comparison between data from the different techniques. A peristaltic pump was used to circulate the reaction mixture from the reaction vessel to the NMR and UV-Vis flow cells via narrow diameter polyether-etherketone (PEEK) tubing (total volume approximately 4 mL, flow rate 4 mL/ min). A sampling valve on this flow loop allowed the periodic collection and automated dilution of 50 lL aliquots of the reaction mixture for analysis by chiral HPLC. The reaction vessel and transfer tubing were jacketed, with two heat exchangers and thermocouples located at various positions in the flow loop used to maintain a constant reaction temperature of 40 °C. Headspace-MS samples were taken directly from the headspace of the reaction vessel. As several of the catalytic intermediates are air-sensitive, the reaction was performed under an argon atmosphere, with the flow loop pressure maintained by use of a back-pressure regulator to prevent outgassing of CO 2 or H 2 in the flow cells. Automated tuning and shimming routines were performed on the NMR flow cell prior to the addition of catalyst and substrate. Acquisition was started and catalyst added.

        <p>Three different NMR experiments were performed, with selective and non-selective NMR spectra acquired in an alternating pattern, and 13 C spectra interleaved at intervals. Non-selective 1 H NMR experiments with 8 scans were used to measure reaction progress and substrate/product concentrations. However the catalyst signals were of too low intensity to be quantified, and thus selective 1 H experiments with an excitation bandwidth of 3 ppm, centred on a hydride peak at À5 ppm, were performed, with 8 scans and at higher receiver gain, to monitor the ruthenium-hydride intermediate. As the reaction volume was continuously moving through the NMR flow cell, only a very short relaxation delay (1 s) was required, because the sample within the detection volume was continually replaced with freshly magnetised sample. To compensate for the decrease in signal intensity resulting from incomplete magnetisation of the sample flowing into the NMR cell, a correction factor was applied to each peak for both selective and nonselective spectra, using integral values recorded under static conditions (see Case Study 5). For integrals recorded using the selective experiment, an additional correction factor was calculated using the 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene internal standard to compensate for the increased receiver gain used for these experiments. Offline sampling confirmed the same reaction kinetics, but with much less detailed information than the online flow analysis, highlighting the power of the latter technique. An induction period of 2 h was observed at the start of the reaction, during which time formic acid was consumed but there was no significant product formation. Hydrogen formation was detected by 1 H NMR during the induction period, accompanied by a shift in the position and linewidth of the formic acid peak. 13 C NMR showed the formation of CO 2 during this time, however the signal intensity was too low to quantify. Combining the NMR results with data recorded by headspace MS confirmed that hydrogen and carbon dioxide were formed in a 1:1 ratio during the induction period. Once the ratio of formic acid to triethyl amine dropped from the initial 2.5:1 to 1.5:1, turnover converting 93 to 94 was observed, with a corresponding decrease in the rate of hydrogen formation.Three different NMR experiments were performed, with selective and non-selective NMR spectra acquired in an alternating pattern, and 13 C spectra interleaved at intervals. Non-selective 1 H NMR experiments with 8 scans were used to measure reaction progress and substrate/product concentrations. However the catalyst signals were of too low intensity to be quantified, and thus selective 1 H experiments with an excitation bandwidth of 3 ppm, centred on a hydride peak at À5 ppm, were performed, with 8 scans and at higher receiver gain, to monitor the ruthenium-hydride intermediate. As the reaction volume was continuously moving through the NMR flow cell, only a very short relaxation delay (1 s) was required, because the sample within the detection volume was continually replaced with freshly magnetised sample. To compensate for the decrease in signal intensity resulting from incomplete magnetisation of the sample flowing into the NMR cell, a correction factor was applied to each peak for both selective and nonselective spectra, using integral values recorded under static conditions (see Case Study 5). For integrals recorded using the selective experiment, an additional correction factor was calculated using the 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene internal standard to compensate for the increased receiver gain used for these experiments. Offline sampling confirmed the same reaction kinetics, but with much less detailed information than the online flow analysis, highlighting the power of the latter technique. An induction period of 2 h was observed at the start of the reaction, during which time formic acid was consumed but there was no significant product formation. Hydrogen formation was detected by 1 H NMR during the induction period, accompanied by a shift in the position and linewidth of the formic acid peak. 13 C NMR showed the formation of CO 2 during this time, however the signal intensity was too low to quantify. Combining the NMR results with data recorded by headspace MS confirmed that hydrogen and carbon dioxide were formed in a 1:1 ratio during the induction period.

        <p>Activation of the chloride pre-catalyst 88 was rapid, reaching completion before the first spectrum was acquired. Although formate complex 91 was observed as the major catalyst species in both 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra, overlap with formic acid peaks meant that hydride 92 was the only catalyst species that could be quantified from NMR data. 16-electron species 89 had no distinguishable peaks in the NMR spectrum, however the strong purple colour allowed the concentration of 89 to be tracked by UV-Vis spectroscopy, so that two of the three catalytic intermediates could be monitored during the reaction. The concentration of hydride 92 showed the same time-dependent distribution as product, with concentration increasing after the initial induction period. No change in product enantioselectivity was observed during the reaction, suggesting that the low concentration of 89 prevented product from re-entering the reaction cycle. Based on these observations a parasitic reaction of hydride 92 with formic acid was proposed as being the cause of the initial induction period, with turnover commencing once the concentration of formic acid dropped below a critical level. When the reaction was repeated with an initial ratio 1.5:1 formic acid to triethylamine, no induction period was observed.Activation of the chloride pre-catalyst 88 was rapid, reaching completion before the first spectrum was acquired.

        <p>This Case Study highlights the substantial benefits of monitoring catalytic intermediates and reaction products simultaneously. Hintermair and collaborators used interleaved data from three different NMR experiments, combined with online UV and inline HPLC and headspace MS, to monitor all reagents, products and by-products of the reaction, along with two out of three on-cycle catalytic intermediates, to deduce the existence of a parasitic side-reaction. This detailed insight allowed mechanism-informed modification of the reaction conditions to both eliminate the induction period and inhibit the unwanted reaction.This Case Study highlights the substantial benefits of monitoring catalytic intermediates and reaction products simultaneously.

Case study 5: Practical aspects of real-time reaction monitoring using multi-nuclear high-resolution flow NMR spectroscopy flow NMR spectroscopy [39] Techniques: Flow NMR; 1 H NMR; Relaxation (T 1 , T 2 ) Hintermair and collaborators have pioneered the use of flow NMR techniques to study intermediates in reactions with lifetimes greater than a few minutes. In a recent publication they reported in detail on the design of apparatus, flow effects (Fig. 41) and data treatment, for their closed-loop continuous-flow system (Fig. 10), which can be coupled to standard high-resolution NMR spectrometers without requiring probe modifications [39]. The stirred reaction vessel ensures efficient mixing of analytes before they are circulated throughout the system by a HPLC pump.

Similar to all flow experiments, the hydrodynamics of the system are of particular importance in the sense of affecting the measurements, therefore the impact from the flow must be analysed for a given experimental set-up. In practice, laminar flow at a relatively low Reynolds number leads to back-mixing in the transfer line. Because the dead time between the reaction being initiated in the reaction vessel and it being measured by NMR in the flow tube is dependent on the flow rate, the latter needs careful optimisation. In addition, the hydrodynamics also determine the intrinsic in-flow and outflow effects of the system, which must be taken into consideration in order to obtain quantitative results.

        <p>The in-flow effect arises from incomplete pre-magnetisation before the reaction mixture arrives at the NMR flow tube for detection. A period of approximately 5 Â T 1 is required for spins to reach thermal equilibrium. Thus attenuated signal intensities and distorted quantification will arise in flow NMR experiments if the T 1 values of nuclei are longer than the residence time of the flowing analytes inside the magnet. The study evaluated the impact of the in-flow effect on signal intensities and confirmed its pure dependence on the intrinsic T 1 values of spins at a given flow rate. More rapidly relaxing species are less affected as they build up magnetization more rapidly, so this in-flow effect exerts a more substantial influence on slowly-relaxing spins. Previous approaches included the introduction of pre-magnetization coils [133] and reduced flow rates [338], both at the cost of elongated dead time. In this work Hintermair proposed the use of a correction factor CF ¼ I static =I flow , derived from recording spectra under flow and stationary conditions. Applying this correction factor to the measured signal integrals during reaction under flow conditions yielded corrected signal integrals, following mathematical relationship I corrected ¼ CF Â I measured . For reactions involving spins of substantially different T 1 values, the required corrections can be significant. This correction factor method can also be applied to spectra rendered non-quantitative due to an insufficient relaxation delay, where I static is a reference spectrum acquired under fully quantitative conditions and I flow is a spectrum acquired with an insufficient relaxation delay. The out-flow effect, on the other hand, is due to the continuous loss of the excited nuclei from the detection volume. This effect leads to flow-dependent enhancements in the rates of both FID decay and z-magnetization restoration. Decreased effective T 1 and T 2 values (T 1 * and T 2 *) under flowing conditions were determined [339], as compared to the intrinsic T 1 and T 2 values under static conditions, using the relationships below, where t B denotes the residence time of spins within the magnetic field.The in-flow effect arises from incomplete pre-magnetisation before the reaction mixture arrives at the NMR flow tube for detection.

        <p>The reduced T 1 * from out-flow effects was found to permit shorter repetition times between scans, allowing either a higher temporal resolution, or more signal averaging (and higher S/N) within a given timeframe. It is important to note that at high flow rates, the in-flow effect dominates and constitutes a major consideration for quantitative measurements. The study also elucidated an initial enhancement of signal intensities in the presence of flow when repetition times are set too short. This phenomenon can be sidestepped either by adjusting the experimental parameters or by applying the correction factor stated above. The reduced T 2 * can lead to broadened peaks at higher flow rates, nevertheless, in practice the effect of out-flow on measured linewidths is usually small compared to that of B 0 field inhomogeneity.The reduced T 1 * from out-flow effects was found to permit shorter repetition times between scans, allowing either a higher temporal resolution, or more signal averaging (and higher S/N) within a given timeframe.

        <p>After evaluating the significance of flow effects for quantitatively assessing chemical reactions, data treatments in flow NMR experiments were explored. Flow experiments in general require large quantities of materials, therefore expensive deuteriated solvents are not recommended. Using protiated solvents poses two challenges: solvent signal suppression, and field locking of the spectrometer. The former is circumvented by a solvent suppression scheme called WET [63] that is particularly useful for flow experiments. The issue of field locking is dealt with through use of modern instruments capable of maintaining field stability in the absence of deuteriated internal standards. Advancements in recent software offer solutions for baseline and phase correction, peak deconvolution, signal drift etc., in order to obtain qualitative and quantitative results. Moreover, the exclusion of deuteriated solvents obviates any undesired kinetic solvent isotopic effects (Section 5.3) which can interfere with mechanistic studies.After evaluating the significance of flow effects for quantitatively assessing chemical reactions, data treatments in flow NMR experiments were explored.

        <p>Kind and Thiele chose the base-catalysed hydrolysis of ethyl acetate (95) as the process for study. To allow fast mixing of the two reagents, they constructed a simple rapid injection device consisting of a standard 5 mm NMR tube equipped with two fluorinated co-polymer tubes. The NMR tube was pre-loaded with ethyl acetate in D 2 O ,and a solution of potassium deuteroxide (KOD) was injected via a syringe through one of the FEP tubes to start the reaction, with the other FEP tube providing a vent for displaced air. Mixing was induced by the impact of the rapidly injected KOD solution, and was complete after approximately 1.5 s. The NMR tube was weighed before and after the reaction to confirm that the correct quantity of base had been added.Kind and Thiele chose the base-catalysed hydrolysis of ethyl acetate (95) as the process for study.

Relaxation delays of 15 s and 5 s were required for the 90°and 15°pulses respectively to ensure that the magnetisation was fully recovered between scans, giving temporal resolutions of 3 and 12 spectra/ minute. In both non-selective experiments significant line broadening was observed, along with significant distortions to the peak shape. These changes were attributed to variations in the local magnetic field homogeneity caused by the increase in volume after the injection of the KOD solution.Using non-selective pseudo-2D pulse-acquire experiments the kinetic time courses for the reaction were measured with 90°a nd 15°pulse angles and 1 s acquisition time.

        <p>To improve temporal resolution, a spatially selective NMR experiment was tested (Fig. 42). A magnetic field gradient of 12.6 G/cm was applied along the axis of the tube, causing the Larmor frequency of the protons to vary as a function of position. Bandselective pulses of 300 Hz bandwidth were used to excite 0.06 mm slices of the NMR tube, with 32 slices acquired from a 0.5 cm region. The small sample region was chosen intentionally, as the magnetic field is more homogenous over small volumes, allowing sharper peaks to be recorded. Small shifts in peak position were observed between slices due to magnetic field inhomogeneity along the z-axis, however these were easily corrected during processing. Using a small sample region also meant that any regions of poor mixing towards the top and bottom of the NMR tube were excluded, however this came at a cost of 95 times lower signal-tonoise than the non-selective experiment.To improve temporal resolution, a spatially selective NMR experiment was tested (Fig. 42).

After a complete cycle through all slices the process was repeated. Since the time between successive measurements on any given slice was &gt;5 Â T 1 , the magnetisation in each slice had time to recover before the next pulse without the need for a relaxation delay.

        <p>The same ester hydrolysis was measured using the spatiallyselective pulse sequence, with the increased temporal resolution allowing additional points to be measured at the start of the reaction. Loss of signal and large distortions in peak shape were observed immediately after addition of the KOD solution, caused by the movement of the sample during mixing producing similar effects to convection. These distortions were short lived, and after 8 s sharp peaks were observed for all resonances. The frequencyshifted pulses used for the spatially-selective NMR experiments imparted a phase shift between different slices, requiring each spectrum to be individually phased before integration. Whilst the largest source of error in the non-selective experiments was that due to the wide integration regions needed to encompass the broad peaks, integration errors in the spatially-selective experiments primarily resulted from the low signal-to-noise ratio. As all product and reagent peaks were well resolved in the selective experiments, rate constants were calculated for each peak and then averaged to give a single value. Measured rate constants for both selective and non-selective reactions were comparable with reported literature values measured using conductivity or titration. The uncertainty in the rate constant was higher for the 90°non-selective experiment than for the 15°or selective experiments due to the smaller number of points available for fitting.The same ester hydrolysis was measured using the spatiallyselective pulse sequence, with the increased temporal resolution allowing additional points to be measured at the start of the reaction.

'Different excess' experiments revealed no dependence of reaction rate on the concentration of 98, and a positive order with respect to 99. At high concentrations of 99, the plots of concentration of 100 against time started to coincide, indicating saturation kinetics. Performing the experiments at different pre-catalyst loadings revealed first-order kinetics with respect to the Pd. Moreover, the reaction is zerothorder with respect to both bases (KOPiv and DIPEA), but the rate depends on the identity of the carboxylate, and to a lesser extent on the counterion. However, 'same excess' experiments showed a lack of agreement between time-adjusted plots. Product inhibition was disproved by further experiments, indicating that the lack of agreement is due to processes involving degradation of the catalyst.The reaction was followed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and Reaction Progress Kinetic Analysis (RPKA, Section 4.3.7.1) performed to obtain information about the mechanism.

The PdCl 2 ÁXantphos pre-catalyst was mixed with various combinations of reaction components and changes in the 31 P NMR signals analysed. It was found that the pre-catalyst interacts with pyrrole 98 in the presence of KOPiv to form a new species, 101, which was isolated, characterised via Xray diffraction (Fig. 43), and determined to be the oxidative addition complex of pyrrole 98 to the corresponding catalyst (with mono-oxide of Xantphos as a ligand). Moreover, upon cooling the catalytic system to ambient temperature, intermediate 101 was detected in solution (the corresponding bis-phosphine and bisoxide complexes were also detected). Intermediate 101 was shown to be competent in coupling of 98 with 99 under catalytic conditions, and to stoichiometrically react with KOPiv + 99 to give 100. Under catalytic conditions, no induction period was observed. Moreover, Xantphos bis-phosphine inhibits the reaction with 101 as catalyst, suggesting stronger binding of the latter to Pd(II).

The Pd(II)-pivalate species is the resting state under the reaction conditions, hence explaining the saturation kinetics in 99 and the zeroth order with respect to base. These results, along with KIE analysis and computational modelling, led to elucidation of the full mechanism of the reaction.The role of the bases in the reaction was also studied via 31 P{ 1 H} and 13 C{ 1 H} experiments and found to be two-fold, promoting both formation of the catalyst via reduction of Pd(II), and direct C-H functionalisation via anion metathesis of Br.

        <p>Pure shift NMR is a technique that is of growing interest due to its ability to remove the effects of coupling, resulting in singlet peaks and thus spectral simplification. The Uhrin group recently developed SHARPER (Sensitive, Homogeneous And Resolved Peaks in Real time) and selective SHARPER (sel-SHARPER) pure shift pulse sequences, which are of particular relevance for reaction monitoring. An introduction to SHARPER and other pure shift techniques was provided in Section 3.5. The SHARPER technique removes heteronuclear coupling using a chunked acquisition with gradients and 180°pulses used to refocus an on-resonance peak whilst removing all heteronuclear coupling in the manner of a CPMG pulse sequence. A key feature of the SHARPER sequence is that all pulses are applied to the observe nucleus channel, meaning that it can be used to decouple nuclei that share the same channel, as is often the case for 1 H and 19 F.Pure shift NMR is a technique that is of growing interest due to its ability to remove the effects of coupling, resulting in singlet peaks and thus spectral simplification.

        <p>To demonstrate the utility of the SHARPER technique, spectra of fluorobenzene were recorded using a standard 19 F pulse-acquire pulse sequence and the SHARPER sequence with 256 acquisition chunks, each lasting 34 ms, giving a total acquisition time of 17.9 s. The SHARPER sequence successfully removed all heteronuclear coupling, producing a single peak with half-height linewidth of 0.14 Hz and eight times increase in signal-to-noise ratio compared to a pulse-acquire spectrum with the same acquisition time. Small sidebands were observed as a side-effect of the chunked acquisition, however reducing the chunk duration to 5 ms effectively eliminated these artefacts. Whilst reducing the chunk duration improved the quality of the spectrum, a small decrease in signal-to-noise ratio and increase in linewidth were observed due to relaxation during the spin-echo pulses.To demonstrate the utility of the SHARPER technique, spectra of fluorobenzene were recorded using a standard 19 F pulse-acquire pulse sequence and the SHARPER sequence with 256 acquisition chunks, each lasting 34 ms, giving a total acquisition time of 17.9 s.

        <p>Modifying the SHARPER experiment to include selective 180°p ulses, with an additional spin-echo element prior to the first chunk, produced a selective version of the experiment (sel-SHARPER) which additionally removed homonuclear couplings. This was demonstrated on a sample containing 2-[ 2 H]-1,3,4trifluorobenzene, with a sel-SHARPER experiment using 128 acquisition chunks of 13.6 ms duration successfully removing 19 F- 19 F, 1 H- 19 F and 2 H- 19 F couplings to produce a single, sharp peak.Modifying the SHARPER experiment to include selective 180°p ulses, with an additional spin-echo element prior to the first chunk, produced a selective version of the experiment (sel-SHARPER) which additionally removed homonuclear couplings.

        <p>The refocusing effects of the SHARPER sequence are also capable of removing line broadening resulting from poor magnetic homogeneity. To demonstrate this, an inhomogeneous field was generated by deliberately offsetting the x, y, z, z 2 , z 3 , xy, xz, and yz shims by 500 units, resulting in broad peaks with linewidths of around 40 Hz. Using a sel-SHARPER experiment with 128 chunks and 13.6 ms chunk time, the linewidth was reduced to 0.34 Hz with the integrated signal intensity 60% of the well-shimmed sample. As with the non-selective SHARPER experiment, small sidebands were observed which decreased in intensity with decreasing chunk duration. Similar results were observed for dynamic inhomogeneities caused by sparging small bubbles of nitrogen gas through the solution in the NMR tube, using a SHAR-PER experiment with 64, 128, 256 or 512 chunks of durations 8.5, 4.25, 2.13 or 1.06 ms respectively. Again, using a smaller chunk duration improved the quality of the spectrum, with line width roughly halving when moving from 64 to 256 chunks. Whilst better homogeneity and correspondingly narrower linewidths were measured when the rate of bubbling was slow, increasing the rate of bubbling resulted in greater stability between measurements due to the more constant number of bubbles in each spectrum.The refocusing effects of the SHARPER sequence are also capable of removing line broadening resulting from poor magnetic homogeneity.

        <p>The application of SHARPER for reaction monitoring was demonstrated using two reactions. The protodeboronation of 2,3,6-trifluorophenyl boronic acid (58; see Case Study 1) was monitored using a stopped flow NMR system (Section 2.4.4.2) to rapidly mix water/dioxane solutions of the boronic acid and potassium hydroxide. 19 F sel-SHARPER measurements (128 acquisition chunks) were made at reaction times between 13 and 208 s. Sharp peaks (0.5 Hz) were observed for the product, however the reagent peaks were broadened due to reversible chemical exchange between the boronic acid and the corresponding boronate (102), Fig. 44. A linewidth correlation factor, Eq. ( 77), was determined for the SHARPER experiment. In Eq. ( 77), the d (PFG+pulses) term accounts for the additional relaxation that occurs during the pulsed field gradients and 180°pulses that are applied between the acquisition chunks. After correction for this effect, the natural linewidth was then used to calculate the rate constant for chemical exchange in 2,4-difluorophenyl boronic acid (46) based on the decrease in linewidth observed when the concentration of hydroxide was increased.The application of SHARPER for reaction monitoring was demonstrated using two reactions.

        <p>The oxidation of diphenylphosphine was monitored under aerobic conditions using 31 P sel-SHARPER. Air was bubbled at a rate of 180 mL/h through a sample of diphenylphosphine in toluene-d 8 , with the reaction monitored by standard 31 P NMR and sel-SHARPER for a total of 228 spectra (2400 s). To minimise the effect of bubbling gas, and the large 31 P-1 H coupling, the chunk size was reduced to 0.8 ms, with a total of 400 chunks acquired for each SHARPER spectrum. Whilst signal intensity was lower for the SHARPER experiments than for the standard pulse-acquire sequence, signal-to-noise ratio was improved by eight times and line widths reduced from 30 Hz to 2.8 Hz, resulting in less scatter between reaction time points. This Case Study shows how the SHARPER and sel-SHARPER experiments are powerful additions to the reaction monitoring toolkit, removing hetero-and homonuclear coupling along with the effects of poor magnetic homogeneity, producing sharp singlet peaks with increased signal-to-noise. Using these pulse sequences, kinetic information can be obtained for challenging reactions where signal intensity is reduced by coupling or due to highly inhomogeneous biphasic conditions. 6.9.

Next, they charged the required volumes of solution of 108, 109, 1,3-difluorobenzene and CD 2 Cl 2 into an NMR tube, submitted it to the NMR spectrometer, locked the sample to CD 2 Cl 2 , shimmed, and acquired their initial 19 F{ 1 H} spectrum.

        <p>To conclude the study an inverse secondary isotope effect was determined, using two techniques, namely competition and parallel reactions, to analyse [ 2 H 1 ]-108. For both techniques the same general procedure was followed as described for the in situ analysis. For the competition experiment a 50:50 mixture of [ 2 H 1 ]-108 and 108 was co-reacted. As these two species have clearly defined isotopically shifted signals in the 19 F{ 1 H} spectrum, this allowed for the relative consumption of each starting material to be followed during the reaction. This data could then be used to determine k H /k D = 0.88, an inverse SKIE, supporting a mechanism in which the Michael addition (and resulting change in hybridisation at the labelled carbon) is the turnover-limiting step. The parallel reaction technique required two separate reactions to be carried out in two NMR tubes, one with the deuteriated vinyl bis-sulfone and one with the non-deuteriated. The same in situ VTNA analysis was performed and the resulting k H /k D value of 0.89 agreed well with the previous result.To conclude the study an inverse secondary isotope effect was determined, using two techniques, namely competition and parallel reactions, to analyse [ 2 H 1 ]-108.

        <p>This study highlights how much information can be obtained through VTNA. Smith and collaborators were able to obtain the reaction order and information about catalyst inhibition, and elucidate information regarding the turnover-limiting step, all from a few well-considered in situ 19 F NMR experiments. By utilising 19 F NMR they could study a system which had a complex 1 H spectrum, but a simpler and readily integrated 19 F spectrum, thus highlighting one of the main reasons researchers turn to 19 F NMR. Whilst VTNA cannot be used alone to determine the full kinetics, it does powerfully complement other tools for investigating mechanism.This study highlights how much information can be obtained through VTNA.

        <p>Further experimental and computational work indicated that the more fluorine atoms coordinated to the boron in the [ArBF 3-n -(OH) n ] À species, the higher the barrier to transmetallation of the Ar group to Pd in the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. It was therefore concluded that ArB(OH) 2 (35) or [ArB(OH) 3 ] À (115) are the most active species for the transmetallation, even though present in very low concentrations. To test this experimentally an isotope entrainment study (section 5.4) was conducted, using an in situ 19 F NMR protocol. Thus, samples of d 0 -112 and d 4 -35 were dissolved in 10/1 (v/v) THF/D 2 O in varying ratios, followed by Cs 2 CO 3 , bromoarene (113) and benzotrifluoride (internal standard). After addition of the palladium catalyst, at 0 °C, an aliquot was taken and delivered to a 5 mm O.D. J Young valve NMR tube. To initiate the reaction the NMR tube was agitated in a water bath at 55 °C, after which it was loaded into the preheated (at 55 °C) probe in the NMR spectrometer and spectra recorded every 100 s for the first 1000 s, every 200 s for the next 1000 s, and every 600 s for the remainder of the reaction. The spectra were analysed, and each peak integrated to generate temporal concentration data, as well as isotope distributions. Plots of isotope distribution in the biaryl product (d 4 / d 0 -114) as a function of conversion of aryl showed that the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling proceeded in parallel with the establishment of the equilibrium between aryltrifluoroborate 112 and aryl boronic acid 35, with the cross-coupling product being predominantly d 4 -114.

        <p>The same in situ 19 F NMR protocol was used to compare reactions using solely the aryltrifluoroborate 112 versus the aryl boronic acid 35, and confirmed that the latter results in faster Suzuki-Miyaura coupling than the trifluoroborate, but generates more unwanted side reactions. Maintaining a low concentration of the aryl boronic acid/boronate (35/115) via slow hydrolytic release from the aryltrifluoroborate 112 is one of the major reasons why the overall Suzuki-Miyaura coupling is more efficient using 112.The same in situ 19 F NMR protocol was used to compare reactions using solely the aryltrifluoroborate 112 versus the aryl boronic acid 35, and confirmed that the latter results in faster Suzuki-Miyaura coupling than the trifluoroborate, but generates more unwanted side reactions.

        <p>Enzymatic reactions are ubiquitous in nature, yet they are very challenging to study by NMR spectroscopy due to the micromolar concentrations of reaction species in in vivo samples, combined with the high reaction rate of many enzymatic reactions. 1 H NMR spectroscopy would require an unreasonably large number of scans to acquire sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, which is not practical for reactions that are completed in under a minute. For reactions performed in vitro with whole cells or cell extracts, other species in the sample result in complex spectra, often with very broad lines due to the presence of paramagnetic species. As a result, many enzymatic reactions are studied in isolation or under pseudo-equilibrium conditions with high concentrations of substrate.Enzymatic reactions are ubiquitous in nature, yet they are very challenging to study by NMR spectroscopy due to the micromolar concentrations of reaction species in in vivo samples, combined with the high reaction rate of many enzymatic reactions. 1 H NMR spectroscopy would require an unreasonably large number of scans to acquire sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, which is not practical for reactions that are completed in under a minute.

Following thermal pre-equilibration of the hemolysate at 37 °C in the NMR spectrometer, a solution of sodium fumarate in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected through a thermostatically controlled mixer. The reaction was monitored by single scan 1 H spin-echo spectra for two different concentrations of fumarate, with spectra acquired every 5 s for 20 min. The spin-echo pulse sequence was chosen to minimise line broadening caused by inhomogeneous magnetic fields in the hemolysate.Initial studies were carried out using hemolysate extracted from human red blood cells, which was bubbled with carbon monoxide prior to measurement to ensure that all haemoglobin was stabilised in the diamagnetic Fe(II) form.

        <p>Due to the value chosen for the spin-echo delay, modulations caused by spin-spin coupling meant that both malate CH 2 peaks had negative intensities and required inversion before kinetic analysis. The concentrations of fumarate and malate were calculated from the two equivalent CHs in fumarate and the two CH 2 protons in malate. As no internal standard was employed, the concentrations at each time point were calculated with reference to the initial concentration of fumarate so that total mass balance was maintained over the course of the reaction, and in this way, was not impacted by the signal loss from decaying net DNP in enhanced experiments.Due to the value chosen for the spin-echo delay, modulations caused by spin-spin coupling meant that both malate CH 2 peaks had negative intensities and required inversion before kinetic analysis.

        <p>Having established that the time scale of the reaction was suitable for study by DNP, the same experiment was repeated using hyperpolarised [1,4-13 C]-fumarate. Hyperpolarised fumarate was generated by dissolving [1,4-13 C]-fumaric acid in DMSO-d 6 along with a trityl radical and a gadolinium chelate.

Kinetic time-courses were recorded using single scan 13 C pulse-acquire spectra with a pulse flip angle of 4°. Using a very low pulse flip angle allowed small amounts of the hyperpolarised signal to be sampled every 1 s for a total of 256 spectra, with no need for a relaxation delay between spectra. The signal-to-noise ratio was significantly improved, with much less scatter in the data than for the thermally polarised 1 H spin-echo experiments.Having established that the time scale of the reaction was suitable for study by DNP, the same experiment was repeated using hyperpolarised [1,4-13 C]-fumarate.

        <p>As the hyperpolarised signal is non-renewable, the total signal decayed over the course of the reaction due to sampling and relaxation processes, becoming indistinguishable from noise after 120 s, Fig. 46. The maximum signal for malate was observed at t max = 20 s. The kinetic equations were therefore more complicated than for the 1 H spectra, since in addition to the reversible chemical kinetics an irreversible T 1 relaxation term was required. It is important to note that whilst signal was only observed from the hyperpolarised species (indicated with an asterisk), non-hyperpolarised species were also present in the reaction and contributed to the kinetic equilibrium. The data was fitted using these equations with a partially constrained Markov chain Monte Carlo method, combined with parameter sensitivity analysis to estimate errors. Each measurement of the spectrum reduces the available polarization by a factor equal to the cosine of the pulse flip angle, therefore an additional term for the pulse angle was included when fitting the model. Because the reaction was carried out with a large excess of substrate, the enzyme was assumed to be fully saturated for the duration of the reaction so the estimated Michaelis constants from the 1 H experiments were used.

        <p>From initial observations with BF 3 OEt 2 and TMSOTf, it was identified that the mechanism of activation was dependent on the catalyst and the counter-ion. Despite the near-equal sizes of the donor and the product, and thus poorly-resolved DOSY signals, comparison of the 1 H-and 19 F-DOSY spectra allowed for identification of the intermediates with fluorine-containing catalyst attached. These were identified as glucosyl fluorides and triflates for the BF 3 OEt 2 and TMSOTf catalysts respectively. In contrast, the third catalyst, TMSNTf 2 , was found by 19 F-DOSY to transfer the TMS group to 121.

For the 1 H-DOSY analysis, six compounds ranging in M w from 74 to 1226 (Fig. 47) were selected, all of which were carbohydrate-based structures, ensuring that the influence of shape and size on the diffusion was relevant to the system under study. The diffusion for each compound was measured individually against the 1,3,5-tris(tri fluoromethyl)benzene internal standard. Once each data point had been obtained, a calibration curve of log D vs log M w was generated, with all compounds normalised to log D ref = À9.137, where D ref is the diffusion coefficient for the internal standard.

        <p>Thus, the reactions were analysed in tightly-sealed J Young valve NMR tubes after careful assembly of the components at ambient temperature in the tube in a glove box. Preliminary analysis of the kinetics determined by 19 F NMR analysis in the spectrometer at 130 °C indicated that the generation of the silylation product (145), evolved in two distinct ways: phase I, involving catalyst acti- vation, then a short period of relatively fast catalytic turnover, and phase II, a long period of much slower turnover. The overall reaction profile was then compared with a sample in a sealed NMR tube that had undergone cycles of rapid heating to 130 °C in an oil-bath for a set period of time and then rapid cooling in a pentane bath, with intermittent analysis at the standard probe temperature (27 °C). The temporal concentration profile, with the time periods at 27 °C omitted, was near-identical to that recorded in the spectrometer at 130 °C, Fig. 50b. The method of in situ periodic activation allowed use of the cryoprobe NMR spectrometer (which in this case was limited in temperature range from 2 °C to 80 °C) and, by cycling between samples undergoing periodic activation, a series of reactions could be analysed in parallel, thus maximising the data generated in a given period of NMR spectrometer time.Thus, the reactions were analysed in tightly-sealed J Young valve NMR tubes after careful assembly of the components at ambient temperature in the tube in a glove box.

To each of these NMR tubes was added a different volume (100-200 lL) of a 1.0 mL stock solution containing 4-fluorobenzonitrile (143, 75.89 mg, 0.63 mmol) in mesitylene (1.0 mL total volume).

        <p>All of the components in the reaction, other than Ar-SiMe 3 (145), were found to influence the overall kinetics: the aryl nitrile (143) inhibits phase I, but accelerates phase II, the Me 3 Si-SiMe 3 reagent 144, accelerates phase I, and phase II at low concentrations, but becomes an inhibitor of phase II at high concentrations, and the Me 3 SiCN co-product accelerates phase I, and inhibits phase II.

        <p>By normalising the temporal concentration profiles to the initial pre-catalyst-concentrations, it became evident that the reactions enter phase II after three molecules of Ar-SiMe 3 (145) had been produced per rhodium atom. The absence of the Me 3 SiCN coproduct in the samples until the process transitions into phase II suggested that reversible coordination of three Me 3 SiCN molecules to rhodium results in an inhibited form of the catalyst (147, Fig. 51). The rate of reaction in phase II was consistent with a King-Altman steady-state derivation of a minimal mechanism in which the resting state (the major speciation) of the rhodium is a composite of complexes 148 and 147.By normalising the temporal concentration profiles to the initial pre-catalyst-concentrations, it became evident that the reactions enter phase II after three molecules of Ar-SiMe 3 (145) had been produced per rhodium atom.

        <p>A highly-selective photo-induced 5-exo cyclisation (Scheme 29) of alkynols to cyclic enol ethers using an iron-carbonyl based catalyst (151) was recently reported by the Merck process research group [102]. However, initial optimisation experiments revealed a significant reduction in product yield when the CO was allowed to vent from the reactor, prompting a detailed mechanistic study. As a photochemical system this reaction posed unique challenges for mechanistic study. Traditional methods of in situ monitoring do not allow for irradiation of sample; on the other hand, the need for a closed system and the ability to monitor formation of CO, as well as the chromatographic instability of the product, precluded most traditional ex situ monitoring techniques. Simply monitoring the reaction by periodic activation would not allow for sufficient information to distinguish several mechanistic possibilities, e.g. whether photon absorption occurs on-cycle or off-cycle in an activation process. Thus, in situ illumination NMR spectroscopy (as discussed in Section 2.4.2.2) was employed to probe the reaction under constant and under variable illumination.A highly-selective photo-induced 5-exo cyclisation (Scheme 29) of alkynols to cyclic enol ethers using an iron-carbonyl based catalyst (151) was recently reported by the Merck process research group [102].

        <p>Initial NMR reaction monitoring under constant irradiation at 440 nm revealed the presence of an induction period in the reaction kinetics, implying a catalyst activation process. When the reaction was irradiated for 30 min and then kept in the dark whilst continuing to monitor the reaction by NMR, it was found that the reaction continued, but the rate decayed to almost zero over a period of hours. When irradiation was resumed, a second incubation period was observed and the reaction reacquired its original velocity. This direct NMR observation of 'dark reactivity' was made possible through the use of 'on-off' type switchable in situ illumination equipment, and provided very strong evidence that the role of the light in this reaction is to activate the catalyst, not to facilitate the catalytic cycle.Initial NMR reaction monitoring under constant irradiation at 440 nm revealed the presence of an induction period in the reaction kinetics, implying a catalyst activation process.

        <p>When a solution of the catalyst (151) was irradiated (in an external photoreactor at 450 nm) and UV-Vis spectra were recorded before and afterwards, a red-shift was observed which implied activation by photo-induced loss of a CO ligand to form a 16-electron complex (152). In order to observe this directly in the reaction, a 13 CO labelled catalyst was prepared. This allowed for quantitative 13 C NMR monitoring of both free and Fe-bound Scheme 29.

        <p>The in situ illumination-NMR device was also used to directly measure the quantum yield of the reaction using an NMR actinometry technique [345]. By using a reaction of known quantum yield (in this case the photo-oxidation of 2,4-dinitrobenzaldehyde) to calibrate the light intensity, and by measuring the rate of product formation at different concentrations of iron catalyst, the reaction quantum yield was determined as 3.06. This means that, on average, one photon is responsible for approximately three turnovers of the catalytic cycle, and provides further evidence for reversible photoinduced catalyst activation; photoinduced catalyst turnover would give a reaction quantum yield 1.The in situ illumination-NMR device was also used to directly measure the quantum yield of the reaction using an NMR actinometry technique [345].

        <p>In Sections 1-6 above, we have explored a wide range of topics relating to mechanistic investigation of organic and organometallic reactions using NMR spectroscopy. We began in Section 1 by reflecting on the motivations for the study of reaction mechanisms, why NMR is so well suited to this, what spectrometers and facilities are generally available to the user, and the general experimental workflows employed. In Section 2 we moved on to practical aspects of the reaction itself: what NMR-active nuclei are inherently present, or can be integrated into the process to allow monitoring, what internal reference will be used, what solvent will the reaction be conducted in, what are the physical mixing requirements before and during the reaction, how sensitive is the reaction to air, moisture, light, etc., and what NMR tubes or other samplepresentation methods are appropriate. This led to considerations of the time-scale over which the reaction occurs, and the time available to the user for NMR analysis: will in situ or ex situ monitoring be more effective in terms of data density, operator availability, and required spectrometer time? Can the reaction be interrupted, or periodically activated, or are specialised techniques and equipment required, such as quenched-flow, flow, stoppedflow, rapid injection, electrochemistry, in situ illumination-NMR, high-pressure manipulations of liquids or gasses, or hyperpolarization of nuclei?In Sections 1-6 above, we have explored a wide range of topics relating to mechanistic investigation of organic and organometallic reactions using NMR spectroscopy.

        <p>With the reaction parameters (nuclei, solvent, temperature, monitoring technique, environment. etc.) established, in Section 3 we considered the NMR data itself, both in terms of acquisition and of processing. A key factor to consider is temporal resolution: how fast is the reaction, how many FIDs will be required for a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio, how many data points are required, and over what time period for reliable kinetic analysis. The rate of relaxation of the probed nuclei is a key factor in this assessment, and it is wise to determine T 1 values for the various reactants, products, and intermediates if feasible, early on in the investigation. With these features in mind, we next considered how, for the reaction of interest, optimisation of the acquisition parameters on the spectrometer can lead to substantial benefit in terms of signal-to-noise, resolution, and quantitation. Specialist techniques such as pure shift NMR and SHARPER can allow great insight when spectra are congested, or the magnetic field is inhomogeneous, and spatially-selective acquisitions employing strong pulsed gradients are sometimes advantageous when reaction rates are faster than T 1 relaxation. We also touched upon the use of 2D methods and the tailoring of their application to reaction monitoring, in particular by non-uniform sampling, and minimising errors in extracting quantitative data from 2D spectra. The processing of the NMR data post-acquisition is another important aspect in getting the most out of an experiment, and we noted the benefits of carefully addressing processes such as phasing, base-line correction, zerofilling, and integration, as well as spectral deconstruction, principal component analysis, and spectral hard modelling.With the reaction parameters (nuclei, solvent, temperature, monitoring technique, environment. etc.) established, in Section 3 we considered the NMR data itself, both in terms of acquisition and of processing.

        <p>Having reviewed the technical and practical aspects of the reaction assembly and NMR spectroscopy/spectrometer set-up, we transferred our attention in Sections 4 and 5 to the areas in mechanistic analysis where NMR can be a uniquely effective tool. Section 4 focused on the principles applied in the analysis of the kinetics of reactions, beginning by comparison of the fundamental differences between reactions at dynamic equilibrium, which can be analysed 'at leisure', and those that begin away from equilibrium, and for which, once started, there is a finite window of time during which the NMR data must be acquired. With the experimental data in hand, a variety of options for their analysis can be distinguished. For nonequilibrium kinetics, the classic techniques of initial rates versus full reaction evolution were evaluated, as well as the derivation of integrated rate laws, and the pre-equilibrium and steady-state approximations for linear and catalytic processes were discussed. Graphical and visual methods, such as RKPA and VTNA, were also compared, as well as the simulation of complex mechanistic models using numerical methods. For systems at dynamic equilibrium, two distinct approaches were distinguished. The first is where the chemicallyunperturbed process is probed, either by NMR line shape analysis, or by selectively altering the spin polarisation equilibrium, allowing e.g. EXSY or magnetisation transfer. The second technique is where the chemical equilibrium is rapidly displaced using an external stimulus, e.g. light or heat, and then the relaxation kinetics are followed, either back to the original state, or to a new thermodynamic equilibrium. The equilibrium can also be displaced in a sequence of small chemical perturbations, and the changes in time-average chemical shifts (fast exchange) or speciation (slow exchange) monitored as an 'NMR titration'.Having reviewed the technical and practical aspects of the reaction assembly and NMR spectroscopy/spectrometer set-up, we transferred our attention in Sections 4 and 5 to the areas in mechanistic analysis where NMR can be a uniquely effective tool.

        <p>The use of isotopes formed the basis for Section 5. Isotopes lend themselves perfectly to NMR experiments. Isotopes allow selective labelling of atoms and molecules by virtue of their different NMR properties, and with minimal chemical perturbation, yet at the same time allow that perturbation to be measured to provide useful mechanistic information in the form of kinetic isotope effects. Thus a wide variety of experiments can be conducted, including atom accountancy, enhanced sensitivity when S/N is low at natural abundance, spectral simplification by eliminating signals, determining equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects, breaking symmetry, isotope entrainment to probe reaction flux and validity of proposed intermediates, application of isotope shifts to label by proxy, and use of natural abundance isotopes and satellites as internal standards.The use of isotopes formed the basis for Section 5.

        <p>The chemical literature indicates that NMR has been the technique of choice in the majority of mechanistic studies in organic and organometallic chemistry that have been published over the last two to three decades. Looking forward, it is evident that continuing rapid advances in computation will continue to assist and refine the application of NMR, predicting chemical shifts and couplings and the energetic viability of proposed intermediates and transition states. Developments in non-cryogen high-field magnets will also bring major advances, allowing (physically) smaller spectrometers to be located in the chemical laboratory and interfaced more easily with other instrumentation and reaction vessels, and the means for more rapid and versatile chemical and physical manipulation of samples in the probe of the spectrometer. Whilst new techniques based on other physical and chemical properties continue to be developed, e.g. X-ray free-electron laser methods, we do not anticipate NMR being any less dominant in the coming decades, unless a fundamentally new technique emerges and becomes widely available.The chemical literature indicates that NMR has been the technique of choice in the majority of mechanistic studies in organic and organometallic chemistry that have been published over the last two to three decades.
