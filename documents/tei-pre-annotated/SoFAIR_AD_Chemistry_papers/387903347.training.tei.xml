        <p>The study reports the first attemptt oa ddress the interplay between surface and bulk in hydridef ormationi n ceria (CeO 2 )b yc ombining experiment, using surfaces ensitive and bulk sensitive spectroscopic techniques on the two sample systems, i.e.,C eO 2 (111)t hin films andC eO 2 powders, and theoretical calculations of CeO 2 (111)s urfaces with oxygen vacancies (O v )a tt he surfacea nd in the bulk. We show that, on as toichiometricC eO 2 (111)s urface, H 2 dissociates and formss urfaceh ydroxyls (OH). On the pre-reduced CeO 2Àx samples, both films and powders, hydroxyls and hydrides (CeÀH) are formed on the surfacea sw ella si nt he bulk, accompanied by the Ce 3 + $ Ce 4 + redoxr eaction. As the O v concentration increases, hydroxyl is destabilized and hydride becomes more stable. Surface hydroxyl is more stablet han bulk hydroxyl, whereasb ulk hydride is more stablet han surface hydride. The surface hydride formation is the kinetically favorablep rocess at relatively low temperatures,a nd the resulting surface hydride may diffuse into the bulk region and be stabilized therein.A th igher temperatures,s urface hydroxyls can react to produce water and createa dditional oxygen vacancies, increasing itsc oncentration, which controls the H 2 /CeO 2 interaction. The results demonstrate al arge diversity of reactionp athways, which have to be taken into account for better understanding of reactivity of ceria-based catalysts in ah ydrogen-rich atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Interaction of hydrogen with metal oxidesi si ntimately involved in many important processes,f rom H 2 storage to thermal, photo-ande lectro-catalysis. [1] It exhibits complex behavior, [2] including homolytic dissociation at two oxygens ites, thermodynamically favored for readily reducible oxidesl eading to two hydroxyl (OH) groups and the concomitant reduction of two surfacem etal cations, and heterolyticd issociation at metal and oxygen sites primarily occurring on oxides difficult to reduce. The process may involve the migration of Ha toms into the sub-surface region and the bulk to form hydroxyl and hydride (H À )s pecies therein.</p>
        <p>Beyond this, the interaction of H 2 with ceria (CeO 2 )h as recentlyr eceived much attention because ceria, widely used as oxidation catalysts, demonstrate the potentiala sas elective catalystf or alkyne semi-hydrogenation reactions. [3] It is assumedt hat H 2 undergoes dissociationf orming two surfaceO H groups. [4] The resulting OH groups react to producew ater at elevatedt emperatures,c reatingo xygen vacancies (O v ). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the homolytic dissociation of H 2 at two oxygen sites is thermodynamically favored on fully oxidized, stoichiometric CeO 2 (111)s urface. [5] However,t he calculations also suggested ah eterolytic H 2 dissociationt ob ek inetically favored on this surface to form a CeÀHa nd aO Hs pecies. [6] The resulting CeÀHs pecies further evolve to the thermodynamically more stable OH species, accompanied by the reduction of Ce 4 + into Ce 3 + .</p>
        <p>Oxygenv acancies on ac eria surfaceh ave been shown, both theoretically and experimentally,t os trongly affect the H 2 -CeO 2 interaction. The oxygen vacancies can even be formed in situ during the reaction, e.g.,b yd esorption of water via recombination of surfaceO Hs. Theoretical calculations indicatedt hat the stability of CeÀHs peciesr esulting from heterolytic H 2 dissociationi se nhanced on reduced, i.e.,O v -containing cerias urfaces. [7] Experimentally,s urface oxygen vacancies on CeO 2 were observed to affect the reactivity of surface hydroxyls by suppressing the water production pathway and promoting the H 2 production pathway. [8] In addition, the processesm ay be influenced by oxygen vacancyd iffusion, as water formation and the accompanied oxygen vacancy formation happeno nt he surface. According to DFT calculations, [9] both, vacancy formation and diffusion, are rather independent of surfaceo rientation. Using inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy,W u et al. [10] first reported the direct spectroscopic evidencef or the formationo fC e ÀHs pecies upon H 2 dissociation overc eria powdern aturallyc ontaining oxygen vacancies. Wernere tal. [11] observedt hat H 2 dissociation on af ully oxidized CeO 2 (111)t hin film surfacef orms hydroxyl species, primarily located at the surface, while on the reduced CeO 2Àx (111)t hin films CeÀHs pecies were also found in appreciable quantities below the surface indicating that the absorption of hydrogen leads to the formation of O v -stabilized hydride speciesi nt he bulk. Furthermore, H 2 adsorption at room temperature wass hown to lead to the oxidation of Ce 3 + in both CeO 2Àx (111)t hin films and CeO 2Àx powders to Ce 4 + , [12] demonstrating the formation of more CeÀHh ydride speciesa tt he Ce 3 + -O v sites than OH species at the Os ites. Very recently,S chweke et al. [13] using thermal gravimetric analysisa nd thermal desorption spectroscopy of ceria powders studied the influence of temperature, hydrogen partial pressure, and oxygen vacancies on the H 2 -CeO 2 interaction. The presence of oxygen vacancies was found to lead to the penetration of hydrogen into the sub-surface and bulk, possibly as hydride species.</p>
        <p>The likelyn et chemical reactions between H 2 and ceriai nclude: homolytic dissociation to OH [Eq. ( 1)]:</p>

        <p>homolytic dissociation to CeÀH[ Eq. ( 3)]:</p>
        <p>heterolytic dissociation [Eq. ( 4)]:</p>
        <p>It is clear that the H 2 -CeO 2 interaction is complex and quite sensitivet ot he reactionc onditions. Combined studies on model systems with different levels of complexity have been demonstrated to be an effective strategy towards af undamental understanding of complex systems. [14] Herein,w er eport a comprehensive experimental study of H 2 interaction with welldefined CeO 2 (111)t hin films and CeO 2 powders in wide range of temperatures and pressures, combinedwith DFT calculations of CeO 2 (111)s urfaces with oxygen vacanciesa tt he surface and in the bulk. We provide spectroscopice videncef or the interplay between hydroxyl and hydride formation within the bulk, and connectt hose resultst ot he evidencep resented for the corresponding species on the surface and in the near surface region, allowing us to reach ac onsistent picture.</p>
        <p>We first address experimental results obtained on the fully stoichiometric CeO 2 (111)thin films using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) and X-ray photoelectrons pectroscopy (XPS).F igure 1a shows as eries of IRAS spectram easured in 10 mbar of D 2 at several temperatures in the range of 300-600 K. No reactiono ccurs at 300 K. On the sample exposed to D 2 at 400 K( henceforth denoted as "CeO 2 -400"), D 2 dissociates forming OD species identified by the n(OD) band at about 2700 cm À1 depending on exposure (see Figure S1 in Supporting Information). Upon cooling to 235 Ki nD 2 atmosphere,t he band increases in intensity and shifts to the higher wavenumbers. Interestingly,t his band disappearsa fter pumping D 2 out. However,i to nly decreases in intensity on the "CeO 2 -500" sample whilet he intensity remains on the "CeO 2 -600" sample, thus indicating different stability of surface ODs formed at different adsorption temperatures. Concomitantly,t he n(OH) bands at 3660 and 3665 cm À1 and additional bandsa t1 295 and 1265 cm À1 emerge,w hich are assigned to adventitious adsorptiono fr esidual H 2 Oa nd CO 2 from the vacuum background.</p>
        <p>To examine whether the reactionw ithh ydrogen induced changes in the electronic structure, we measured XPS spectra immediately after the IRAS measurements. The spectra of the Ce 3d and O1 sc ore levels were recorded both at normala nd grazing emissions, the latter are only shown in Figure 1b.T he complexC e3 ds pectra in CeO 2 are usually rationalized in terms of the spin orbit pairs of the Ce3d 9 4f 0 O2p 6 , Ce3d 9 4f 1 O2p 5 and Ce3d 9 4f 2 O2p 4 final states, [15] labeled in the Figure as 4f',4f '' and4f ''',r espectively.I fp resent, Ce 3 + species manifest themselves by additional signals, which correspond to the 4f'' and 4f'''final states. Since the Ce 4 + and Ce 3 + states overlap,t he degree of ceria reduction can only be determined after ar elativelyc omplex deconvolution procedure and background subtraction.</p>
        <p>The fully stoichiometric CeO 2 (111)f ilms exhibited aC e 3 + /(Ce 3 + + Ce 4 + )s ignal ratio (henceforth, Ce 3 + concentration) of about 0.01. After reaction with D 2 at 300 and 400 K, no additional Ce 3 + species wered etected, suggesting that surfacer eductiond oes not occur at low temperatures, in full agreement with the IRAS results. In contrast, considerable amounts of Ce 3 + are observed after reactions at 500 and 600 K, indicating progressive ceriar eduction at high temperatures. Aw ell-resolved O1s signala tt he higherb inding energy( BE) side of the main peak at 529.4 eV is assignedt oO H(OD) and carbonateslike speciesdetected by IRAS (Figure 1a).</p>
        <p>It is important to note that, upon increasing the D 2 exposure temperature from 500 to 600 K, the intensity of the adsorbates-related O1 ss ignal, normalized to the total O1 ss ignal, only slightly increases, from 0.18 (0.09) to 0.22 (0.1) measured at grazing (normal)e mission, whereas the Ce 3 + concentration measured from analysis of the Ce 3d region increases substantially,f rom 0.28 (0.16) to 0.55 (0.42). This finding indicatest hat, after the reaction at 600 K, considerable amountso fo xygen vacanciesa re located not only at the surface (where they would be easily filled by residual water as shown by IRAS), but also in the sub-surface region.</p>
        <p>In the next set of experiments,w eaddressed interaction of D 2 with reduced, i.e.,C eO 2Àx (111)f ilm surfaces. Figure 2a summarizes the IRAS results of the exposure experiments at different temperatures. Note that, in contrast to the CeO 2 (111)s urface, the reduced surfacem ay react with traces of water in the UHV background even before the introduction of D 2 ,t hus formingO Hs peciesa ss hown in spectra marked by (*) for three different temperatures. The corresponding XPS results are displayed in Figure 2b.</p>
        <p>The resultso fe xperiments with D 2 at 300 Kn icely reproduce our previous results obtainedw ith H 2 . [12] No surfaceO Ds are observedu pon D 2 exposure, whereas XPS (not shown here) revealed as tronge lectronic effect:A lmost no Ce 3 + remained at the surfacea fter D 2 treatment indicating the formation of Ce 4 + -D À À species.</p>
        <p>At 400 K, D 2 dissociates giving rise to aw eak n(OD) band at 2675 cm À1 .U pon cooling in D 2 ,t he band gains in intensity togetherw ith the OH band (from residual water). After pumping the D 2 gas phase out and then heating the sample to 300 K, the OH band increases at the expense of the OD band. However,t he measured frequency ratio (n(OH)/n(OD) = 1.357) suggests that OH and OD species are identical in nature,t hus occupying the same adsorption sites.T he interplay between intensities of OH and OD bands can be explained by the H-D exchange reaction and/or by competition between H 2 Oa nd D 2 for adsorption sites.</p>
        <p>Again, after reaction at 400 K, the Ce 3 + concentration is dramatically decreased (Figure 2b)d ue to the formation of hydride species. Small amountso fC e 3 + originate from surface hydroxyl species, detected by IRAS (Figure 2a)a nd O1s XPS. Since the integral intensity of the O1s signal remains unchanged after reaction, the observed oxidation of ceria cannot be explained by migration, if any,o fl attice Of rom deeper layers to the surface.T herefore, the interaction of hydrogen with reduced ceria surfaces at 300 and 400 Kp rimarily results in hydrides pecies.</p>
        <p>The same experiment at 500 K, however, revealed ad ifferent picture.W hile also here the adsorption of residual H 2 Og ives rise to a n(OH) band at 3635 cm À1 ,s urface hydroxylation through D 2 dissociation dominates the spectra:Astrong n(OD) band appearsa t2 693cm À1 .U pon subsequentc ooling and pumping, aw eak band emerges around 2600 cm À1 ,w hich falls in the range of frequencies characteristicf or H-bonded hydroxyls, [16] and additional bands appear in both the n(OH) and n(OD) regions,i .e.,a t3 629a nd 2677 cm À1 ,r espectively.T hese latter values closely resemble those observedi ne xperiments at 400 K, and probablyd evelop during the reactionw hile sample cooling in D 2 atmosphere.</p>
        <p>In contrastt ot he experimentsa t3 00 and4 00 K, comparison of the Ce3d spectra before and after reactionw ith D 2 at 500 K revealed similar concentration of Ce 3 + .H owever,asignificant portion of Ce 3 + species may originate from ah igh density of surfacehydroxyls, which obscure XPS detection of hydride species. It may also well be that H(D) atoms migrate into the deeper layers of ceria at 500 Ka nd thus become "invisible" to surfaces ensitive XPS. Both the Ce3d and O1s spectra after reaction at 500 Kl ook virtually identicalt ot hose obtained during the same experiment on the stoichiometric CeO 2 (111) film (Figure 1b). Even IRAS spectra measured on CeO 2 and CeO 2Àx films at 500 Ki nD 2 atmosphere display almost identical intensitya nd position of n(OD) bands (Figure 3a). Based on these results, one concludest hat the initial degree of surface reduction does not play ac riticalr ole in the D 2 -CeO 2 interaction at elevated temperatures, since the surface reduction and oxygen vacancy formation occurs in situ on the initially oxidized cerias urface via recombinative desorption of surfaceh ydroxyls formed by hydrogen dissociation.</p>
        <p>It is interesting that the positiono ft he OD bandso bserved on CeO 2 and CeO 2Àx films at 400 Ks how considerably different frequencies, i.e.,2 696 and 2675 cm À1 ,r espectively (see Figure 3a). To rationalize this result,w er efer to DFT calculations [11] showingt hat the frequency depends on the local degree of reductions urrounding the surfaceh ydroxyl, i.e., on the number of Ce 3 + ions among the three Ce ions the hydroxyl is coordinated to:T he higher the Ce 3 + ion content,t he higher the frequency. Therefore, the OD groups formed on the fully oxidized CeO 2 surface (2696 cm À1 )a re coordinated to more reduced Ce ions than the OD groups formed on the pre-reduced CeO 2Àx surface( 2675 cm À1 )( see Figure 3b for as chematic representation). Even thought his might be counterintuitive, the effect can be explained if we recall the XPS results (Figure 2b)s howing that the D 2 interaction with the reduced CeO 2Àx surface at 400 Kr esults in hydride species and the oxidation of Ce 3 + to Ce 4 + .T herefore, the low-frequency band may be assigned to OD which is coordinatedt oC e-D hydride species formed on the reduced films (Figure 3b). Such ar ed-shift could even be used as an indication for hydride speciesa tt he surface. In the same manner, the low-frequency "satellite" bands (3629a nd 2677 cm À1 )f ound for the CeO 2Àx surfacet reated at 500 K( Figure 2a)c an also be assigned to OH and OD groups on surface hydride sites, which are formed during sample cooling in D 2 .</p>
        <p>Therefore, combined IRAS and XPS study on well-defined CeO 2 (111)f ilms showst hat molecular hydrogen dissociates at relativelyh igh pressures and temperaturesa nd forms surface hydroxyls. On pre-reduced films, however,both surfacehydroxyls and hydrides are formed. The hydride formation seemst o be the favorable process at relativelyl ow temperatures (&lt; 400 K) within the surface layers probed by XPS, while hydroxylation dominates at higher temperatures, whichisa ccompanied by surface reduction throughw ater desorption.</p>
        <p>Now we address experimental results for the H 2 -CeO 2 interaction obtained on ceria powders under realistic pressure conditions, i.e., 1atm 5% H 2 /He, 1atm H 2 ,a nd 10 atm H 2 ,i no rder to investigate the interplay between surface and bulk in hydroxyl and hydride formation. As shown by electron microscopy (Figure 4), conventional CeO 2 powders (from Sigma-Aldrich, see Supporting Information) consist of irregularly shaped polyhedraln anoparticles (10-50 nm) which primarily expose the (111)f acets and minor ( 110) and ( 100) facets. [3b, c, 17] This morphologyb asically remains after CeO 2 powders were treated in 1atm of H 2 at 773 K. Since it has been shown by DFT calculations, [9] that the energies to create oxygen vacancies on the (111), ( 100) and (110) surfaces are comparable (i.e.,2 .0-2.6 eV), and all are much smaller than in the bulk (3.4 eV), the comparison between the powder samples and the CeO 2 (111)t hin films appearstob eappropriate.</p>
        <p>According to the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) spectra (Figure S2), surface reduction in 1atm of 5% H 2 /He commencesa ta bove 500 K. [8b] In pure H 2 ,t he reduction reasonably occurs at lower temperatures ( % 380 K) and reaches a maximum at 440 K. Hydrogen uptake peak at 615 Ki sassociated with the reduction in subsurface/bulk region. [8b] Both processesa re accompanied by the formation of water.I ta ppears that the reduction of ceria becomesmore difficult with increas- ing H 2 pressure to 10 atm. Ab road water signal peaked at 522 Km ay be attributed to reduction both at surfacea nd in subsurface/bulk layers. Meanwhile, the H 2 consumption does not occur concurrently with the water production, beginning already at 360 Ka nd maximizing at 470 K. These observations suggest that the interaction with hydrogen at 10 atm occurs at profoundly lower temperatures that, in turn, influences the subsequentreduction of ceria.</p>
        <p>Figure 5a shows in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) spectra of ceria powders exposed to H 2 at variousc onditions. (Henceforth, the notation CeO 2Àx -X-Y stands for ceria treated in Xa tm of H 2 and temperature Y( in K).) In the n(OH) region, av ibrational feature at 3666 cm À1 emerges upon exposure to 1atm H 2 at 473 K, which grows ands hifts to 3655 cm À1 at 723 K. In addition, a new broad band centered at 950 cm À1 appears. (Weak vibrational features at 860, 1016 and 1044 cm À1 in this region arise from adventitiousC O 2 adsorption. [18] )T he spectrum does not change much in 10 atm of H 2 at 723 K. Moreover,t he observed bands are stable and basically remain after sample cooling to 373 Ka nd subsequent pumping the H 2 gas out (Figure S3). Ceria exposed to 10 atmD 2 at 723 Kr evealed as trong OD band at 2691 cm À1 ,w hich corresponds to the OH counterpart at 3655 cm À1 in the H 2 experiments,a nd nicely matches the one observed by IRAS on the ceriaf ilms at 500-600K(see Figures 1a and 2a). The 950 cm À1 band disappearsu pon D 2 adsorption, indicating that this feature relates to the H-involving vibrations. Thisb and falls in the range of frequencies characteristic for vibrations of bulk CeÀHs pecies. [10,19] Accordingly, CeÀDs pecies would show up at frequencies strongly red-shifted as compared to CeÀH, which is below the cut-off frequency of our setups (both for IRAS studies on thin films and DRIFT studies on powders). Please note, that IRAS spectra on metal supported films obey the well-known metal selection rules [20] and detecto nly vibrations associated with dipole changes normalt ot he surface. Therefore, our present resultsp rovide first IR-based experimental evidencef or the formation of bulk hydride species upon interaction with H 2 .Arelativelyl arge bandwidth indicates the presenceo fC e ÀHi nd ifferent local environments. In addition to bulk species, the surface CeÀH specieswas previouslyobserved in oxidized ceria rods exposed to 1bar H 2 at 673 K, whiche xhibited av ibrational feature at around5 00 cm À1 in inelastic neutrons cattering spectra. [10] Note also that the indications of CeÀHv ibrations in av ery recentR amans tudy of cerium-hydrideg rowth centers on metallic Ce foil. [21] Figure 5b displays respective MAS 1 HNMR spectra of the H 2treated ceria samples.U nfortunately,C e ÀHs peciesc annot be detected. [22] Ceria heated at 773 Ki nH ee xhibits signals at 1.14/0.77a nd 5.34 ppm arising from surfaceO Hg roups and adsorbed H 2 O, respectively. [23] The signals grow with the H 2 pressure and temperature. An additional weak feature emerges at 8.39 ppm upon exposure to 1atm H 2 at 773 Ka nd increases significantly upon exposure to 10 atm H 2 at 773 K. This feature can be assigned to bulk OH groups in ceria. [23] Therefore, the NMR results provide clear evidence of the increaseo ft he total OH coverage. The OH formation mainly occurs on the surface at temperatures up to 473 Ka nd extends to the bulk region at 773 K. Comparing the evolutions of bulk CeÀHs peciesd erived from the in situ DRIFTS resultsa nd bulk OH group from the NMR results, we infer that the formationo fb ulk CeÀHs pecies is more favored than that of bulk OH groups in ceria exposed to H 2 at 773 K, where bulk reduction occurs and bulk oxygen vacancies form.(The full dataset of DRIFTS and NMR results are showni nF igures S4 and S5.)</p>
        <p>In order to link theser esults to the thin film data, the ceria samples were characterized by XPS (Figure 6a and Figures S6a,S7). Based on XPS data, ceria heated to 773 Ki nH e, in order to create oxygen vacancies, exhibitsa ni nitial Ce 3 + concentration of 9.2 %w ithin the nears urface region determined by the escape depth of the Ce 3d-electrons ( % 3nm), henceforth referred to as Ce 3 + surf .T hen, the sample was exposed to 1a tm H 2 at three different temperatures (303,4 73, and 773 K). Consequently,t hose samples were annealed at the elevated temperatures, up to 773 K, and XPS spectra were recorded. Exposure to 1a tm of H 2 at room temperature (CeO 2Àx -1-303) decreasest he Ce 3 + surf concentration, as also observed above for the films, due to OH andh ydride formationa nd its interconversion. Increase in temperature under the same pressure conditions (CeO 2Àx -1-473, CeO 2Àx -1-773), or in pressure at 773 K (CeO 2Àx -10-773), leads to as maller effect. Upon vacuum annealing of the samples the amounto fC e 3 + surf increases due to water desorption and shows the biggest effect for the sample treated at 10 atm. Now we compare the XPS results with EPR data (spectra are shown in Figures S6b andS8), probing both surface/nears urface and bulk species. The relative changes in the Ce 3 + concentration (henceforth, Ce 3 + bulk ), as represented by the EPR intensity normalized to that of pristine ceria( prepared in the same way as the samples for XPS), are shown in Figure 6b. Except the CeO 2Àx -1-473s ample, the Ce 3 + bulk concentration drops to very low valuesi nC eO 2Àx -1-773a nd CeO 2Àx -10-773, as well as for the room temperature sample, clearly indicating bulk hydride formation in these samples. Since EPR probest he entire sample, both surface and bulk, the small amount of Ce 3 + near the surface (monitored by XPS,F igure 6a)c ontributes much less to the signal. The obvious increase of Ce 3 + observed by XPS and EPR on the CeO 2Àx -1-303s ample upon vacuum annealing or purging at 423 Kr eflects the transformation of surface Ce 4 + H À into more stable surface OH,a ccompanied by the reduction of Ce 4 + into Ce 3 + ,a nd the decomposition of surfaceC e Ov 4 + H À into hydrogen and Ce Ov 3 + . [12] It is interesting to note, that, after He purging at and above 423 K, the EPR data for the CeO 2Àx -1-303 almost match the set of data taken on the CeO 2Àx -1-473s ample. Ag lance at the water desorption data (Figure S9) tells us that this is due to the onset of water desorption and thus oxygen vacancy formation around4 00 K. Both the Ce 3 + surf and Ce 3 + bulk concentrationsi n CeO 2Àx -1-303 andC eO 2Àx -1-473 and the Ce 3 + surf concentrations in CeO 2Àx -1-773a nd CeO 2Àx -10-773 then increase and exceed the initial concentration of CeO 2Àx upon vacuum annealing or purging at 523 Ka nd above, again, mainly due to the recombinative reactiono fs urfaceO Hg roups to produce water and create O v and Ce 3 + .H owever,t he Ce 3 + bulk concentrationsi nt he CeO 2Àx -1-773 and CeO 2Àx -10-773 samples are always lower than the initial concentration, indicating the presence of bulk CeÀHs pecies. They increase upon annealing at 523-623K via the reaction2 Ce Ov 4 + H À ! H 2 (g) + 2Ce Ov 3 + ,b ut decreasea th ighert emperatures (773 K), although the H 2 productionc ontinues (FigureS9).O no ne hand, this agrees with the DRIFTS results that the H 2 productionsa bove 623 Kf or CeO 2Àx -1-773 andC eO 2Àx -10-773 involvet he OH species. On the otherh and, this indicates the re-formation of bulk Ce Ov 4 + H À speciesm ost likely by the migration of Ha toms in surface OH species to bulk Ce Ov 3 + sites. Similar phenomenaw ere previously observed to occur on the highly hydrogenated and reduced TiO 2 surfaces. [24] These observationsd emonstrate that the stabilityo fC e ÀHs peciese nhances greatly with the O v concentration in ceria.</p>
        <p>In summary,t he variations of Ce 3 + surf and Ce 3 + bulk species (determined by XPS and EPR, respectively)i ndicate relative amountso fC e 3 + createdb yt he homolytic dissociation to OH and oxygen vacancy formation reactions [Eqs. ( 1) and (2) in the Introduction],a nd annihilated by the homolytic dissociation to Ce Ov 4 + H À [Eq. ( 3)],w hich, together with the formed Hs pecies, can be used to deduce which reactions occur upon H 2 -CeO 2 interaction and where.C ertainly,t he Ce 3 + surf and Ce 3 + bulk species overlap in the subsurface region. Compared to ceriap retreated at 773 Ki nH e, the CeO 2Àx -1-303 sample contains less Ce 3 + surf and Ce 3 + bulk ,d ue to the kinetically-favored heterolytic dissociation to OH and Ce 4 + H À on the ceria surface [Eq. ( 4)] and homolytic dissociation to Ce Ov 4 + H À at surfaceo xygen vacancy sites [Eq. ( 3)].A t4 73 and 773 K, H 2 undergoes the thermodynamically favored homolytic dissociation to OH species on the ceria surface, the oxygen vacancy formation reaction, and the homolyticd issociation to Ce Ov 4 + H À at initially present and newly formed oxygen vacancies in the sub-surface region, leadingt oa lmostu nchanged Ce 3 + surf as initially observed in CeO 2Àx -1-473, CeO 2Àx -1-773a nd CeO 2Àx -10-773. The only slightly increasedC e 3 + bulk concentration observed for CeO 2Àx -1-473 is likely due to either limited creation of bulk oxygen vacancies or the limited diffusivity of hydride filled oxygen vacancies at that temperature. However,C eO 2Àx -1-773 and CeO 2Àx -10-773 with high oxygen vacancy concentrations, arising either from diffusion or creationi nt he bulk, exhibit almost no Ce 3 + bulk ,i ndicating the formation of bulk Ce Ov 4 + H À .T hose samples also exhibit bulk OH species arising from the homolytic dissociation to OH or the heterolytic dissociation in the bulk.</p>
        <p>To study the relative stabilities of proton( H + ÀO) and hydride (H À ÀCe) speciesa tC eO 2 (111)s urfaces with different degrees of reduction,w ec onstructedC eO 2 (111)-nOV surf [n refers to the number of surface oxygen vacancies ranging from 1t o4 ,a nd n = 4c orresponds to aO v coverage of 0.16 monolayer (ML)] based on the "hydroxyl-vacancy model". [25] Note that for the cases of n = 2, 3, and 4, the surface oxygen vacancies form an energetically favorable (linear) surface oxygen vacancy dimer, trimer,a nd tetramer,r espectively (Figure 7a). It can be seen from Figure 8a that, by increasing the concentrationo fs urface oxygen vacancies( n = 1 ! 4), the adsorption energy (strength)o fp rotond ecreases significantly (1.40 ! 0.61 eV), which agreesw ell with the previoust heoretical study. [26] In contrast, the adsorption energyo fh ydride shows an opposite trend. More specifically,t he adsorption energy of hydride drastically changes from À0.71 to 0.41 eV,w hen increasing the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies (n = 1 ! 4), indicating that surface hydride can be stabilized by oxygen vacancies. Presumably,t his is because the electron-donating character of CeO 2 (111)i se nhanced, and, hence,s urface hydride gets stabilized. Therefore, it may be expected that surfaceh ydride is more stable than surface hydrogen atom at heavily reduced CeO 2Àx (111)s urfacesw ith n &gt; 4, although we were not able to simulates uch surfaces due to the high computational cost.</p>
        <p>We also evaluated the relative stabilities of hydrogen atom and hydrides peciesi nt he bulk of ceria by constructing the slab models of CeO 2 (111)w ith one and four aggregated oxygen vacancies in the middle O-Ce-O trilayer (denoted as CeO 2 (111)-1OV bulk and CeO 2 (111)-4OV bulk ,r espectively,s ee Figure 7b). Not surprisingly,c ompared with the surfacec ase, oxygen vacancies in the "bulk" have similar effectso nthe stabilities of surrounding hydrogen atom and hydride species (see Figure 8b). It is interesting to note that, for the vacancyrich case of CeO 2 (111)-4OV bulk ,t he bulk hydridei s% 1.4 eV more stable thanacorresponding hydrogen atom, suggesting that hydride is the dominant species in the bulk region of heavily reduced ceria. Meanwhile, these results also indicate, that bulk hydride is more stable than surface hydride, whereas as urface hydrogen atom is more stable than ab ulk hydrogen atom.</p>
        <p>Based on the representative CeO 2 (111)-4OV surf model,w e studied the following three possible dissociation pathways of H 2 :( i) homolytic dissociation of H 2 to two surfaceh ydrogen atoms (denoted as the homolytic-1 pathway);( ii)homolytic dissociationo fH 2 to two surfaceh ydrides (the homolytic-2 pathway);( iii)heterolytic dissociation of H 2 to one surface proton and one surface hydride (the heterolytic pathway). The calculated energy profiles and the relevant structures are presented in Figure 8c and Figure S12, respectively.The three dissociation pathways all start from aw eakly adsorbed H 2 (E ads = 0.02 eV) above aC ea tom. We found that the heterolytic pathwayg ives the lowest activation energy barrier of 0.56 eV,f ollowed by the homolytic-2 pathway (barrier:1 .15 eV). Although the homolytic-1 pathway is thermodynamically most favorable, it has a highest barrierof1.75 eV,w hich is consistent with the previous study. [7b] Therefore, formation of surfaceh ydride through the heterolytic and homolytic-2 pathways is kinetically favorable on the CeO 2 (111)-4OV surf surface. We also found that the transformation of surfaceh ydride to surfacep roton is extremelyd ifficult at CeO 2 (111)-4OV surf since it needs to overcomeahigh barriero f2 .67 eV (Figure 8d and Figure S13). Accordingly, hydride is kinetically stable at such surface. Meanwhile, the recombinativedesorption of surfacehydrides to H 2 is mostfavorable both, thermodynamically and kinetically,a mong all H 2 production pathways from Hs pecies. Ther esults based on the CeO 2 (111)-4OV surf andC eO 2 (111)-4OV bulk models also suggest that surface hydrides, once formed, can readily diffusei nto the bulk region and be stabilized therein at heavily reduced conditions. Therefore, the DFT resultsf ully agree with the above experimental observations for H 2 -CeO 2Àx powder systems. The scaled DFT-calculated vibrational frequencies of surface and bulk hydrides based on the selected models( i.e., CeO 2 (111)-4OV surf ,C eO 2 (111)-1OV bulk ,a nd CeO 2 (111)-4OV bulk )a re summarized in Ta ble S1.T he vibrations of bulk hydride depend strongly on the configurationo fo xygen vacancies, but they cover the experimentally observed broad vibrationalb and centered at 950 cm À1 (Figure 7c). For surface hydride, the vibration at 963 cm À1 (Figure 7c)e xhibits ad ipole moment parallelt o the surface, which rationalizes its absence in IRAS experiments with CeO 2Àx (111)t hin film due to the well-known metal surface selectionr ule appliedi nI RAS. [20] Summary Our combined experimental and computational resultsp rovide ac omprehensive picture of the H 2 -ceria interaction and highlight the vital role of oxygen vacancies in this process as well as the important interplay between surface and bulk. On as toichiometric CeO 2 surface, H 2 only dissociates to form surface hydroxylsa te levated temperatures. On reduced CeO 2Àx ,h ydroxyls and hydridesa re formed on the surfacea nd in the bulk, depending on O v concentrationa nd location.The general trends are that hydroxyl is destabilized as the O v coveragei ncreases, whereas hydride is stabilized, and that surfaceh ydroxyl is more stable than bulk hydroxyl, whereas bulk hydride is more stable than surface hydride. The surface hydride formation is the kinetically favorable process at relatively low temperatures, and the resulting surface hydride can easily diffuse into the bulk region and get stabilized therein. At higher temperatures, surfaceh ydroxyls can reactt op roduce water and create additional oxygen vacancies, which in turn control the H 2 -ceria interaction.</p>
        <p>The results demonstrate the facile formationo fh ydride (Ce Ov 4 + H À )a tt he Ce Ov 3 + site, leading to the oxidation of Ce Ov 3 + .C e 3 + sites associatedw ith oxygen vacancies play an important role in determining the CeO 2Àx reactivity,t herefore, their annihilation via the Ce Ov 4 + H À formation will affect the CeO 2Àx reactivity.T he resultsa lso demonstrate the hydride formation at the in situ created oxygen vacancy sites of ceria during the reduction process, suggesting that the ceria reduction by H 2 should follow the reaction equationC eO We believe that our results showing the diversity of reaction pathways taking place upon interaction of H 2 with ceria will aid in full understanding of the reactivity of ceria-based catalysts in ahydrogen-rich atmosphere.</p>
