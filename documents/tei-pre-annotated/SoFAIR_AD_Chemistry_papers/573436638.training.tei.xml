        <p>Reported herein is av isible-light-mediated radical approach to the a-alkylation of ketones.T his method exploits the ability of anucleophilic organocatalyst to generate radicals upon S N 2-based activation of alkylh alides and blue light irradiation. The resulting open-shell intermediates are then intercepted by weakly nucleophilic silyl enol ethers,w hich would be unable to directly attackt he alkylh alides through at raditional two-electron path. The mild reaction conditions allowed functionalization of the a position of ketones with functional groups that are not compatible with classical anionic strategies.Inaddition, the redox-neutral nature of this process makes it compatible with ac inchona-based primary amine catalyst, whichw as used to develop ar are example of enantioselective organocatalytic radical a-alkylation of ketones.</p>
        <p>The a-alkylation of ketones is af undamental CÀCb ondforming process. [1] Classically,itisaccomplished by means of highly nucleophilic alkali metal enolates,g enerated by deprotonation of the corresponding ketones,which can react with alkyl halides through an S N 2pathway (Figure 1a). [2] This two-electron, anionic strategy has found extensive use in synthesis.However,italso brings about some chemoselectivity issues because the strongly basic and nucleophilic nature of the metal enolates limits the range of functional groups that can be tolerated. Milder alternatives,w hich avoid the use of strongly basic metal enolates,a re therefore highly soughtafter. Silyl enol ethers are stable enolate equivalents that are easy to synthesize and to handle. [3] These compounds have been extensively used in nucleophilic addition chemistry (aldol, Michael, and Mannich-type processes). [4] However, the poor nucleophilicity [5] of silyl enol ethers makes them unsuitable for alkylation reactions with alkyl halides via an S N 2pathway (Figure 1a,right arrow). Theliterature contains only af ew reports of silyl enol ether alkylation, generally limited to S N 1-type substitution processes. [6] In principle,t he high reactivity of open-shell intermediates,w hich can easily engage in C À Cb ond-forming processes, [7] could be used for effective reactions with the weakly nucleophilic silyl enol ethers 1 (Figure 1b). Moving from at wo-electron logic to ar adical reactivity pattern could therefore provide the desired degree of chemoselectivity and functional-group tolerance to the a-alkylation of ketones. However,effective strategies to generate alkyl halide-derived radicals would be required. To date,t he few reported protocols are limited to the use of specific radical precursors that can be easily activated by initiators or through singleelectron-transfer (SET) processes,i ncluding perfluoralkyl [*] D. Spinnato, [+] Dr.B.Schweitzer-Chaput, [+] iodides, [8] a-bromo ketones and esters, [9] and N-(acyloxy)phthalimide derivatives. [10] In addition, redox-based strategies (e.g. photoredox catalysis) [11] offer an additional challenge because the low oxidation potentials of silyl enol ethers [12] make them prone to degradation upon SET oxidation.</p>
        <p>Our laboratory recently reported aunique photochemical catalytic radical generation strategy that is not reliant on the redox properties of the substrates. [13] This method exploits the ability of ah ighly nucleophilic [14] dithiocarbonyl anion organocatalyst A to generate radicals upon blue light irradiation and S N 2-based activation of substrates (including alkyl chlorides and mesylates) that would be inert to classical radical-generating strategies (Figure 1c). Herein, we demonstrate how this catalytic platform can provide ag eneral radical approach for the a-alkylation of ketones by using silyl enol ethers.T his approach synthetically complements and enriches traditional two-electron strategies.T his is because the mild reaction conditions and functional-group tolerance allowed us to functionalize the a position of ketones with moieties that are incompatible with classical anionic processes.</p>
        <p>We commenced our studies by evaluating the alkylation of acetophenone-derived silyl enol ether 1,u sing the commercially available chloroacetonitrile 2a as the radical precursor (Table 1). Thee xperiments were conducted at 25 8 8Ci n acetonitrile,w ith ab lue LED strip emitting at 465 nm, 10 mol %o ft he dithiocarbonyl anion catalyst A,a dorned with an indole chromophoric unit, and as light excess of 1 (1.5 equiv). When using the trimethylsilyl derivative 1a, these conditions furnished the desired ketone product 3a in good yield along with traces of the silyl derivative 4 (entry 1). Theu se of different silyl protecting groups,i ncluding tertbutyldimethylsilyl (TBS) and triisopropylsilyl (TIPS), provided better chemical yields and selectively favored the formation of the O-silylated adduct 4 (entries 2a nd 3, respectively). Considering the cost of the silyl enol ethers and the efficiency of the reaction, we continued our investigations with the TBS derivative 1b.A dding water to the reaction mixture allowed us to directly achieve ketone 3a as the major product (entry 4). However,t his hydrolysis step was not uniformly effective for all of the silyl enol ethers evaluated, therefore,w et reated the crude mixture with trifluoroacetic acid or tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF), which quantitatively and consistently led to complete conversion of 4 into the target product 3a (entry 5). Effective hydrolysis can be also achieved in the presence of acids; methanesulfonic acid or HCl in H 2 O( 4equiv,e ntry 6) afforded 3a in high yields.</p>
        <p>Control experiments confirmed that the alkylation reaction could not proceed in the absence of light or catalyst A (entries 7a nd 8). Thep resence of ar adical scavenger (TEMPO,1equiv) completely suppressed the reaction (entry 9), whereas traces of the cyanomethyl-TEMPO adduct could be detected. Importantly,o ur attempts to perform the model reaction by using classical enolate chemistry,f or example,t reating acetophenone with strong bases,m et with failure (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information). Finally, we demonstrated that the strongly reducing fac-Ir(ppy) 3 photoredox catalyst provided vastly inferior results (entry 10), presumably because of ad ifficult generation of the reactive radical from 2a.</p>
        <p>Using the optimized conditions described in Table 1, entry 5, we tested the generality of the photochemical organocatalytic a-alkylation process (Figure 2). Firstly,w e evaluated the scope of the carbon radicals that could be intercepted by the silyl enol ether 1b.Alarge variety of electrophilic primary radicals afforded the corresponding aalkylated ketones in good yields (3a, 3e, 3h). Secondary radicals could also be generated and efficiently intercepted by 1b,a lbeit, in some cases,t here was an eed to perform the reaction at 60 8 8C( adducts 3b-d, 3f-g). Benzylic radical precursors,bearing both electron-rich and electron-poor aryl substituents,were also competent substrates (products 3i-n).</p>
        <p>Thes trategy can be used to implement ar adical a-aminomethylation process,allowing the introduction of aprotected primary amine (3o)along with atrifluoromethyl moiety (3p). Thereaction could be performed on agram scale without the loss of efficiency( 7.0 mmol scale, 3a obtained in 91 %y ield, 1.0 g).</p>
        <p>We then evaluated the compatibility with unprotected polar functional groups,w hich is an important criterion for assessing the potential applicability of am ethod to the synthesis of complex molecules and drug discovery. [15] Our approach displayed agood level of tolerance towards heterocycles containing nitrogen, sulfur,a nd oxygen atoms (3q-s).</p>

        <p>In addition, good tolerance was achieved for functional groups that would be incompatible with classical anionic alkylation strategies or Lewis acid activation, including unprotected alcohols (3t), amide NÀHb onds (3p), esters (3e and 3r), ketones (3g and 3h), enones (3t), and aldehydes (3i). Finally,c ortisone (3t)a nd chloramphenicol (3u)d erivatives could be used as radical precursors,h ighlighting the potential of this method for the synthesis of complex molecules.A sal imitation of the system, alkyl bromides leading to non-stabilized primary and secondary radicals and to tertiary radicals could not be activated. Alist of moderately successful and unsuccessful substrates for this radical alkylation strategy is reported in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information.</p>
        <p>We then demonstrated that silyl enol ethers derived from aromatic ketones could intercept the electrophilic radical generated from chloroacetonitrile 2a.Avariety of substitution patterns on the aryl ring, with different electronic (4a-e) or steric profiles (4e, 4f), could be easily accommodated.

As ubstrate derived from azaperone,c ontaining an aminopyridine and apiperazine moiety,could be alkylated in moderate yield (4q). Cyclic and acyclicsilyl enol ethers could also be used in this radical alkylation process,l eading to the corresponding aliphatic ketones (5a-5g). Interestingly,selective alkylation at the terminal position of a b-ketoester was achieved (5e), exploiting the modularity of silyl enolate synthesis compared to classical alkali metal enolates.F inally, O,Oand N,Osilyl ketene acetals were also suitable substrates and afforded the corresponding a-alkylated esters and amides in high yields (6a-6g). Achiral oxazolidinone could be used to give moderate diastereoselectivity (6g). This strategy also provides atool for forging quaternary carbon centers by using different silyl enolates (4k, 5g,and 6e-f).</p>
        <p>Ab enefit of this protocol is that it can rely on radical precursors 2 bearing different leaving groups,i ncluding halides (Cl or Br) and sulfonates (OMs or ONs). Thec hoice of the leaving group can therefore be dictated by its ease of access or compatibility with other functional groups in acomplex synthetic plan.</p>
        <p>To showcase the synthetic utility of the system, we used this strategy for the stereoselective catalytic a-functionalization of ketones (Figure 3). Although effective catalytic enantioselective methods are available,t hey are limited to ionic chemistry. [16] Thed irect asymmetric a-alkylation of ketones with radicals remains ad ifficult target. [17] This is in contrast to the radical functionalization of aldehydes,f or which the combination of enamine-mediated catalysis and photoredox catalysis recently provided useful tools for the design of asymmetric processes. [18] Thel ack of application in the enamine-mediated functionalization of ketones is due to the peculiar structure of the cinchona-based primary amine B. [19] This chiral amine is often the catalyst of choice in ionic chemistry because it can trap different electrophiles with consistently high stereocontrol upon activation of ketones by enamine formation. However,c atalyst B bears an easily oxidizable tertiary amine moiety,w hich makes it incompatible with aphotoredox catalyst usually needed to generate the reactive open-shell intermediate.I np rinciple,t he redoxneutral nature of our radical-generation strategy means that catalysts A and B could coexist. As depicted in Figure 3, this possibility was translated into experimental reality to develop an enantioselective direct radical a-alkylation of cyclic ketones 7.T he dithiocarbamate anion catalyst A effectively activated chloride 2a toward radical formation, and the hydroquinidine-derived amine B secured the formation of achiral enamine upon condensation with 7,which could easily trap the radical. This photochemical strategy afforded the corresponding a-cyanoalkylation products 8a-h. [20] Although cyclohexanone derivatives provided high stereocontrol (8ag), af ive-membered ring proved less reactive and stereoselective (8h). Interestingly,a cid-sensitive functionalities,i ncluding an acetal or aBoc group,were tolerated well (8e and 8f). This asymmetric alkylation could be extended to other alkyl chloride radical precursors;2 ,4-dinitrobenzyl chloride and phenacylc hloride afforded the corresponding alkylated products (8i and 8j)with good results.</p>
        <p>Theproposed catalytic cycle of the photochemical radical alkylation of silyl enol ethers is outlined in Figure 4. The nucleophilic catalyst A attacks [14] the alkyl halide 2 to form the photon-absorbing intermediate I. [21] Blue light irradiation triggers the cleavage of the weak CÀSbond to generate apair of radicals II and III. [22] Thes ilyl enol ether 1 is reactive enough to intercept the carbon-centered radical II,leading to the a-oxo-stabilized radical IV.S ET between IV and the sulfur-centered radical III regenerates catalyst A and forms the oxocarbenium ion V,which can easily hydrolyze to afford the final a-alkylated ketone 3. [23] To glean insights into the mechanism, we measured the quantum yield (F)ofthe model reaction, which was found to be as low as 0.05 (l = 460 nm, using potassium ferrioxalate as the actinometer,experiments performed both with astoichiometric amount of intermediate I and under catalytic conditions,s ee Section E.5 in the Supporting Information for details). This result suggests that ar adical-chain process,b ased on either ad ithiocarbamategroup-transfer mechanism or aS ET from radical IV to intermediate I,i sh ighly unlikely (see Section E.6 for these alternative mechanistic pathways).</p>
        <p>Mechanistically,w ea lso evaluated the possibility for the dimeric adduct VI,arising from the self-reaction of the sulfurcentered radical III,t ob eg enerated during the process (Figure 4). We did indeed detect intermediate VI under catalytic conditions.I na ddition, an authentic sample of VI (5 mol %) catalyzed the model reaction when irradiated with blue LEDs,a ffording product 3a in quantitative yield (no reaction was observed in the dark). These observations suggest that dimer VI is aphotoactive species in equilibrium with the progenitor radical III.T his dimerization pathway confers alonger lifetime to III, [24] facilitating the turnover of catalyst A (SET reduction from IV).</p>
        <p>In summary,w eh ave developed av isible-light-mediated organocatalytic strategy for the radical a-alkylation of ketones by using silyl enol ethers.T his process synthetically complements traditional two-electron strategies.T he mild reaction conditions and functional-group tolerance allowed us to install, at the a position of the ketone,m oieties not compatible with classical anionic processes.I na ddition, the redox-neutral conditions of this process make it tolerant of a cinchona-based amine catalyst, which was used to develop an enantioselective variant.</p>
