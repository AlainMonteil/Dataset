        <p>It has come to the limelight that certain metals such as manganese, iron, zinc and copper in the accurate proportion hold significance to life [1]. However, lesser exposure to these vital metals causes critical health and environmental hazards. On the contrary excess exposure of these metals lead to poisonous effects [2]. The reason behind this partly lies in the fact that heavy metals hold a great tendency to generate complexes mainly with different biological ligands, which contain oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen. Consequently, it can cause enzyme inhibition or breakage of hydrogen bonds and changes the protein molecular structure [3][4]. These interactions are highly reactive; hence, can be carcinogenic and toxic to both the human and the environment. The direct impact of these toxic heavy metal ions (HMIs) has been seen on the human health such as the ions of Cu, Cd, Hg, Pb (kidney or liver); Hg, Pb, As (central nervous system) and Ni, Cu, Cd, Cr (skin, bones or teeth) [5].It has come to the limelight that certain metals such as manganese, iron, zinc and copper in the accurate proportion hold significance to life [1].

Additionally, several other methods and techniques have been widely preferred to detect the trace or very low quantities of HMIs. These reported techniques for detection include (but not limited to) X-ray Fluorescence [26]; potentiometric methods [27]; and neutron amplification [28]. However, the above stated techniques have key drawbacks such as requirements of expensive materials, low throughput, specialized personnel to carry out the operational processes, multi-step sample preparation and excessive time consumption [29][30][31]. Apart from this, a significant rise in contamination of samples is seen during sample handling and storage that can lead to sample modification [32]. These collective limitations with the existing detection techniques need to be overcome by replacing with novel techniques.

        <p>Different electroanalytical techniques have proved to be viable for replacing traditional tools for qualitative as well as quantitative analysis [35]. Simplified instrumentation, miniaturization, high sensitivity, selectivity, user acceptance, portability, least sample pretreatment and quick processing time make them distinctive [31,[34][35]. The benefits of electroanalytical approaches make the application easy and straightforward. Despite the unique properties and the advantages in processability, the industrial applications were still not victorious due to low sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) [38]. Some analytical approaches are associated very closely, that are more relevant and reliable in selective and sensitive detection of HMIs. Sometimes, due to presence of other heavy metals (usually present in mixed media), interference in the signal of the analytical target is usually observed [39].Different electroanalytical techniques have proved to be viable for replacing traditional tools for qualitative as well as quantitative analysis [35].

        <p>Novel MOFs are widely accepted electrode materials for sensitive and selective detection by electrochemical techniques. They are largely recognised as promoting electrode modifiers based on the high porosity, the larger surface to volume ratio and tuneable space for coordination [92]. Because of the exceptional durability and stability (hydrothermal and chemical) of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), they are known for the modification of electrodes and electrochemical detection [93]. Zhang et al., [94] synthesised and characterised core-shell matrix based nanostructured materials with high sensitivity and selectivity for trace amount of HMIs detection in real water sample.

It exhibited higher dispersion behaviour in aqueous solution with enhanced bio-affinity and higher porosity. Therefore, it can be proposed as a possible material for the electrodes with high electrochemical activities. The results exhibited higher sensitivity in broader linearity range from 0.01 to 10.0 nM. The reported LOD for sensitive detection was found to be 6.73 and 2.27 pM towards As 3+ and Pb 2+ , respectively. Further, Zhang and co-workers [95] synthesised and characterized novel MOFs based nanomaterials for concurrent revealing of copper(II) as well as lead(II) by electrochemical technique. They functionalized MOFs by incorporating phytic acid and polypyrrole. The obtained MOFs was nomenclatured as PA/PPy/ZIF-8@ZIF-67. The simultaneous detection has also been well demonstrated for copper(II) as well as lead(II) by electrochemical technique. The obtained LOD was reported to be 14.8 and 2.9 nM, respectively. The performance and efficancy of the newly modified electrode was reported to be of excellent and superior quality and the performance excellence was attributed to the outstanding electrical conductivity of PPy, the larger surface area of ZIF8@ZIF-67, and the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f metal complexation power of PA.
