        <p>The last decade has seen a surge of interest in the emissive behaviour of copper(I) coordination compounds, both neutral compounds that may have applications in organic light-emitting doides (OLEDs) and copper-based ionic transition metal complexes (Cu-iTMCs) with potential use in lightemitting electrochemical cells (LECs). One of the most exciting features of copper(I) coordination compounds is their possibility to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in which the energy separation of the excited singlet (S 1 ) and excited triplet (T 1 ) states is very small, permitting intersystem crossing (ISC) and reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) to occur at room temperature without the requirement for the large spin-orbit coupling inferred by the presence of a heavy metal such as iridium.</p>
        <p>In this review, we focus mainly in Cu-iTMCs, and illustrate how the field of luminescent compounds and those exhibiting TADF has developed. Copper(I) coordination compounds that class as Cu-iTMCs include those containing four-coordinate [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + (P^P = large-bite angle bisphosphane, and N^N is typically a diimine), [Cu(P) 2 (N^N)] + (P = monodentate phosphane ligand), [Cu(P)(tripodal-N 3 )] + , [Cu(P)(N^N)(N)] + (N = monodentate N-donor ligand), [Cu(P^P)(N^S)] + (N^S = chelating N,S-donor ligand), [Cu(P^P)(P^S)] + (P^S = chelating P,S-donor ligand), [Cu(P^P)(NHC)] + (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) coordination domains, dinuclear complexes with P^P and N^N ligands, three-coordinate [Cu(N^N)(NHC)] + and two-coordinate [Cu(N)(NHC)] + complexes. We pay particular attention to solid-state structural features, e.g. p-stacking interactions and other inter-ligand interactions, which may impact on photoluminescence quantum yields.</p>
        <p>Where emissive Cu-iTMCs have been tested in LECs, we detail the device architectures, and this emphasizes differences which make it difficult to compare LEC performances from different investigations.</p>
        <p>In 2015, the United Nations Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) identified. 1 The SDGs address all aspects of life on our planet and SDG 7 is concerned with the generation of clean and sustainable energy and the establishment of efficient technologies for energy consumption. A major user of the world's energy is lighting, which accounts for 15% of the energy consumption and 5% of the produced greenhouse gases. 2 Long-established lighting technologies such as the incandescent lamp are extremely inefficient and more efficient devices such as fluorescent tubes have unsustainable and ecologically harmful materials demands. Within Europe, efficient solid-state lighting devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have essentially replaced the earlier technologies. 3 The light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) LEDs and OLEDs are relatively complex multicomponent or multilayer devices (Fig. 1a), usually fabricated in expensive facilities operating at high temperatures and low pressures, and using potentially explosive and toxic materials. An alternative technology is to be found in the light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) which is phenomenologically related to the OLED, and which began to be seriously considered as a viable technology in the mid-1990s. Although LECs bear some relationship to OLEDs, they also exhibit important differences including a simpler device architecture (Fig. 1b), the possibility of routinely using low temperature solution-based fabrication techniques, and less restricted cathode materials allowing manufacture under ambient conditions. [4][5][6][7][8] One fundamental distinction between OLEDs and LECs is the nature of the active (emissive) material: in an OLED this is typically a neutral species, whereas in a LEC, it is charged. However, the use of ionic transition metal complexes (iTMCs) in OLEDs is not excluded. 9,10 Early LECs included luminescent polymers containing ionic salts. 11 The first LEC in which an iTMC was used as the emissive species was reported in 1996 and contained a [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ -based material (bpy = 2,2 0 -bipyridine). 12 However, the low stability of Ru-iTMC-containing LECs under operating conditions and the fact that the emission colour is invariably orange-red, limit the potential applications of such devices. The next family of iTMCs to be developed contained iridium(III) coordination compounds, in particular [Ir(C^N) 2 (N^N)] + complexes where C^N is a cyclometallated chelating ligand and N^N is a diimine or related chelating ligand. Advantages of iridium(III) over ruthenium(II) complexes lie in device stability and the ease of colour tuning the emission maxima. 4, [13][14][15][16][17] A disadvantage of iridium, however, is its low earth-abundance (ca. 3 Â 10 À6 ppm). 18 With an earth's crustal abundance of ca. 50 ppm, 18 copper is an attractive alternative to iridium, and a wide variety of copper(I) coordination compounds has been designed for applications as electroluminescent materials in both OLEDs and LECs.</p>
        <p>The seminal work of McMillin and coworkers in the late 1970s and early 1980s laid the foundation for the development of copper(I) coordination compounds in LECs. In 1978, Buckner and McMillin reported that excitation into the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands of the heteroleptic complexes [Cu(PPh 3 ) 2 (bpy)] + and [Cu(dpe)(bpy)] + (dpe = (E)-bis(1,2-diphenylphosphano)ethene) led to photoluminescence (PL) originating from low-lying charge transfer excited states. 19 This was followed by a series of investigations which demonstrated the emission behaviours of heteroleptic [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + and [Cu(PPh 3 ) 2 (N^N)] + and homoleptic [Cu(N^N) 2 ] + complexes in which P^P is a chelating bis(phosphane) and N^N is a bpy or phen-based ligand (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline). [20][21][22][23][24][25][26] Of particular importance is the fact that [Cu(2,9-R 2 phen) 2 ] + (2,9-R 2 phen = 2,9-disubstituted-1,10phenanthroline) were found to exhibit a long-lived emission in solution at room temperature. 23 The photophysical properties of copper(I) complexes have been reviewed in detail, [27][28][29] and we highlight several salient points that are especially relevant to the design of emissive materials for applications in LECs.</p>
        <p>Copper(I) has a d 10 configuration and four-coordinate copper(I) complexes are tetrahedral or distorted tetrahedral. Upon excitation, the metal centre is formally oxidized with a concomitant flattening of the coordination geometry towards the square-planar environment favoured by copper(II). In the excited state, unless sufficiently protected by sterically demanding ligand-substituents, the Cu centre may be exposed to attack by nucleophiles including solvent molecules to give a five-coordinate exciplex. Steric hindrance resulting from the introduction of substituents into the 2,9-positions of phen in [Cu(phen) 2 ] + derivatives has a profound effect on the PL properties of the compounds. 27,30 Tuning of the emission behaviour can also be achieved through other substituent effects, 31 providing tremendous scope for ligand design. Upon going from homoleptic [Cu(N^N) 2 ] + to heteroleptic [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + complexes, emission behaviour is enhanced. This is a consequence of the reduced flexibility of the [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + coordination sphere which leads to a decrease in the non-radiative deactivation suffered by [Cu(N^N) 2 ] + coordination compounds. 32 However, the solution PL of [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + species is highly dependent upon solvent and the presence of O 2 . An increase in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) upon removal of O 2 from a solution of a salt of [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + is a consequence of the suppression of exciplex quenching. The design of [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + and related emitters should, therefore, address appropriate steric shielding of the copper centre as we illustrate throughout this review.</p>
        <p>Efficient emitters are essential for applications in LECs. In iTMC-LECs containing iridium(III) complexes, the large spinorbit coupling (SOC) of the third-row d-block metal leads to mixing of triplet and singlet states. After photoexcitation of an Ir-iTMC, fast intersystem crossing (ISC) from singlet to triplet excited states leads almost exclusively to spin-forbidden phosphorescence from the lowest triplet state (T 1 ) to the groundstate S 0 . 16 Since copper is in the first row of the d-block, SOC is small, and the mechansim described for Ir-iTMCs does not appertain. However, one of the most exciting prospects for copper(I) coordination compounds is their potential to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in which the S 1 and T 1 excited states lie close in energy, permitting ISC (and reverse intersystem crossing, RISC) to occur without the requirement for a heavy metal. [33][34][35][36] We should also note that in four-coordinate [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + complexes, the HOMO is typically largely located on the copper centre with some contribution from the phosphorus atoms, while the LUMO is localized on the N^N ligand. 37 As in octahedral cyclometallated [Ir(ppy) 2 (bpy)] + (Hppy = 2-phenylpyridine) derivatives, 16 this spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO character should allow for colour tuning of the emissions of heteroleptic copper(I) complexes. However, in practice, as we shall see later, this is less straightforward for copper(I) than for iridium(III).</p>
        <p>Although it has been brought to the fore in respect of heteroleptic copper(I) coordination compounds over the last decade, the phenomenon of TADF has been known (although not originally by this acronym) since the 1960s. 38 In compounds that display TADF, the energy gap between the singlet and triplet excited states, DE ST , † is small (typically ca. 0.12 eV or 1000 cm À1 ). 35 After photoexcitation (S 0 -S 1 ), ISC occurs and creates a triplet reservoir, the lifetime of which is long enough to allow reverse intersystem crossing, RISC, (T 1 -S 1 ) to occur. Repopulation of the singlet state leads to fluorescence (S 1 -S 0 ), and the TADF material is therefore classed as a singlet emitter. If DE ST 4 ca. 3000 cm À1 (0.37 eV), thermal population of S 1 is not effective. 39 In a LEC or OLED, the recombination of electrons and holes leads to the formation of excitons in either a singlet (25%) or a triplet (75%) state (Fig. 2). If the decay of the triplet exciton is spin forbidden, the internal quantum efficiency is limited to 25%. As described above, the large SOC in Ir-iTMCs overcomes this limitation. On the other hand, the success and future exploitation of Cu-iTMCs depends upon TADF (Fig. 2). [33][34][35][40][41][42][43][44][45][46] Experimentally, there are two qualitative probes to investigate TADF. The first is a comparison of the emission decay lifetimes, t, at ambient and low (typically 77 K) temperatures. Longer lifetimes at 77 K compared to ca. 300 K are consistent with a T 1 -S 0 decay (phosphorescence) when RISC is not thermally accessible. The second is a red-shifting of the emission maxmium upon lowering the temperature. This corresponds to a change from predominant contributions to the emission from S 1 -S 0 (fluorescence at room temperature) to T 1 -S 0 (phosphorescence at low temperature). In addition to a small S 1 -T 1 separation (DE ST , Fig. 2), characteristics of state-of-the-art TADF emitters are a high rate of fluorescence decay, a low rate of phosphoresence decay, fast RISC, and a short lifetime of the delayed fluorescence. For in depth discussions of TADF, with an emphasis on copper-containing species, readers are directed to the following references. [34][35][36]41,42,[44][45][46][47][48] The early years Some of the original papers that uncovered the potential of heteroleptic copper(I) complexes for application in LECs were published before it had been fully recognized that TADF could be of importance in this class of compound. Although the synthesis, structure (Fig. 3a) and detailed photophysical properties of [Cu 2 (triphos) 2 (m-4,4 0 -bpy)][BF 4 ] 2 were not published until 2015, 53 this dinuclear complex was used as the electroluminphore in onelayer LECs as early as 2005. 49 This appears to be the first report of a LEC based upon a copper(I)-based emitter. While maintaining a heteroleptic copper(I) core related to those of McMillin's complexes (see earlier discussion), the tripodal ligand triphos (Fig. 3) was selected for the rigidity that it would impose on the coordination sphere of the Cu(I) centre. 54 In solution, [Cu 2 (triphos) 2 (m-4,4 0bpy)][BF 4 ] 2 exhibits an absorption band at 366 nm assigned to MLCT, 49,53 with a solid-state emission with l em max (PL) = 555 nm 53 and an excited state lifetime of 13.6 ms (298 K). Wang et al. fabricated LECs with three device architectures (Fig. 3b) with thin films of the emitting material spin-coated onto the glass/ITO anodes. PEO and PMMA are added to improve film formability (minimizing defects in the film) and stability. All devices had a low turn-on voltage (2 V for LEC in configuuration A, Fig. 3b) and exhibited red-orange emissions. The PL spectrum of the thin-film exhibited a maximum at 555 nm with a red shift of ca. 50 nm upon going to the electroluminesence (EL) spectrum. Under forward bias, the EL maximum was 590 nm, and under reverse bias, l em max (EL) = 618 nm. The origins of this red-shift were attributed to polarization effects and appear analogous to those observed by 55 Device C (Fig. 3b) showed a maximum current efficiency of 0.16 cd A À1 when the LEC was driven at 12 V.</p>
        <p>In 2006, Armaroli reported the first application of mononuclear [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + emitters in LECs. The series of complexes incorporated the phen derivatives 1-3 with the bis(phosphane) POP (Scheme 1). The phen ligands contain 2,9-substituents to prevent flattening of the coordination sphere upon excitation (see earlier discussion) and we will see this feature repeatedly in N^N ligand design. POP and xantphos (Scheme 1) appear in many of the heteroleptic copper(I) complexes described in this review. Both are wide-bite angle chelating ligands, 56 4b) showed moderate efficiency, emitting green light after several minutes under 18 V bias. Notably, though, the performance was comparable to LECs based on [Ru(bpy) 3 ][PF 6 ] 2 electroluminophores. 58 No further progress was made with Cu-iTMCs until our own report in 2011 which demonstrated the potential for bpycontaining heteroleptic compounds in LECs. 59 We look at this study in some detail because of several general points which emerge that are relevant to later investigations. Comparisons of the single-crystal structures of [Cu(P^P)(N^N)][PF 6 ] with N^N = bpy or phen, and P^P = POP or dppbz (Scheme 1) revealed several notable features. The P-Cu-P angles of 115.01(2)1 in [Cu(POP)(bpy)] + (Fig. 5a) and 119.18(2)1 in [Cu(POP)(phen)] + (Fig. 5b) are significantly greater than in the corresponding dppbz complex cations (92.50(2) and 87.14(8)1). In [Cu(POP)(phen)] + , one phenyl ring of a PPh 2 unit in POP engages in a p-stacking interaction with the phen ligand (Fig. 5b). Such interactions help to lock the molecular geometry, and contribute to increased PLQY. 60 ] exhibiting efficiencies of 1.64 cd A À1 under a 4 V bias, and 4.55 cd A À1 under a 3 V bias, respectively. Luminance levels were greater using higher biases but this improvement came at the expense of device stability and efficiency. Significantly, our later studies in 2018 confirmed that [Cu(POP)(bpy)][PF 6 ] is indeed a TADF emitter. 61 The realization that heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes could exhibit TADF seems first to have come with an investigation of the neutral compounds [Cu(POP)(pz 2 BH 2 )], [Cu(POP)(pz 2 BPh 2 )] and [Cu(POP)(pz 4 B)] (see Fig. 6 for the N^N ligand structures). Being neutral, these compounds are more relevant to OLEDs than LECs. However, these ground-breaking results from Yersin and coworkers 62 came at a pivotal point in the development of Cu-iTMCs for LECs. [Cu(POP)(pz 2 BH 2 )], [Cu(POP)(pz 2 BPh 2 )] and [Cu(POP)(pz 4 B)] contain distorted tetrahedral Cu(I) centres and the conformation of each coordinated POP ligand facilitates an intra-ligand p-stacking interaction (Fig. 6a). The compounds are strongly emissive with solid-state PLQYs of 45, 90 and 90%, respectively. Below 100 K, the luminescence originates from the T 1 state; at 1.6 K, the emission bands are broad and unstructured with l em max (PL) values lying between 453 and 474 nm for the three compounds, and decay times (30-100 K) in the range 450 to 610 ms. Above 100 K, the emissions are blue-shifted and the decay times are shorter, consistent with emission from the lowest excited singlet state S 1 . This is the dominant emission at room temperature. For [Cu(POP)(pz 2 BH 2 )], [Cu(POP)(pz 2 BPh 2 )] and [Cu(POP)(pz 4 B)], the S 1 -T 1 separation (DE ST , Fig. 2) was determined to be 1300, 800 and 1000 cm À1 (0.16, 0.10 and 0.12 eV), i.e. small enough to allow TADF to occur.</p>
        <p>In the immediate years after Yersin and coworkers' findings, 62 the relevance of TADF to the emission behaviour of heteroleptic copper(I) coordination compounds and promising performances in LECs began to be appreciated, although it is important to note that measurements of low temperature emission spectra were not routinely carried out to confirm the TADF phenomenon. Thus, in some cases, Cu-iTMCs were not described as TADF emitters even though the phenomenon may have been, or was, operative. For example, we developed a series of [Cu(POP)(N^N)][PF 6 ] and [Cu(xantphos)(N^N)][PF 6 ] compounds in which N^N was a 6-alkyl-or 6,6 0 -dialkyl-2,2 0 -bipyridine (Scheme 2). 37,63 The emissive properties of these complexes were enhanced with respect to those of [Cu(POP)(bpy)][PF 6 ] (see above), consistent with the expectations of introducing sterically demanding substituents close to the Cu(I) centre (Fig. 7a andb). Among this series of compounds, the highest PLQYs were observed for solid-state [Cu(xantphos)(6-Mebpy)][PF 6 ] (34%), [Cu(xantphos)(6-Etbpy)][PF 6 ] (37%) and [Cu(xantphos)(6,6 0 -Me 2 bpy)][PF 6 ] (37%) with lifetimes of 9.6-11 ms. DFT calculations predicted that the emitting T 1 state involved 3 MLCT character. Significantly, we found that the S 1 -T 1 energy difference was in the range of 0.17-0.21 eV (ca. 1400-1700 cm À1 ) for all the complexes in the series. We noted that, while this was larger than the value of DE ST proposed by Leitl et al. 39 to allow population of the S 1 from T 1 at 298 K, contributions to the room temperature emission from fluorescence (S 1 -S 0 ) could not be discounted. 37 LECs with the architecture shown in Fig. 7c were operated under a pulsed current, and exhibited rapid turn-on times. The LEC with [Cu(xantphos)(Me 2 bpy)][PF 6 ] in the active layer (l em max (EL) = 567 nm) achieved a maximum efficacy of 3.0 cd A À1 and a luminance of (145 cd m À2 ) with a device lifetime of 1 hour.</p>
        <p>From 2012 onwards, reports of Cu-iTMCs exhibiting TADF grew considerably, although not all compounds have been tested in LECs. Heteroleptic copper(I) compounds for which TADF has been described include halide and pseudo-halide containing complexes including several {Cu x X y } clusters. Most of these are neutral and are of interest for OLEDs; selected examples which have been tested in OLED configurations are shown in Scheme 3. 36, Copper We now consider emissive materials in each class, and provide insight into design of appropriate ligands and ligand combinations to enhance photoluminescence. In terms of applications in LECs, we note that efficient PL is not necesssarily an indication that a Cu-iTMC will perform well as an electroluminophore in a device. Selected neutral compounds with structures related to those in the classes of Cu-iTMCs but which have been designed for OLED applications are also included in our discussion. 32 These results are in accord with our findings that the solid-state PLQY of 43.2% for [Cu(POP)(6,6 0 -Me 2 bpy)][PF 6 ] exceeds that of [Cu(POP)(6-Mebpy)][PF 6 ] (9.5%) 63 and [Cu(POP)(bpy)][PF 6 ] (3%). 97 The emission spectrum of a powdered sample of [Cu(POP)(4,4 0 ,6,6 0 -Me 4 bpy)][BF 4 ] (l exc = 350 nm) is broad at 300 K with l em max (PL) = 555 nm and a decay time of 11 ms. On cooling to 77 K, the emission undergoes a red-shift to 575 nm with PLQY = 47%, and the decay time increases to 87 ms. The E10-fold increase in the radiative rate on going from 77 to 300 K, coupled with the blue-shift from 575 to 555 nm, were rationalized in terms of TADF at 300 K (S 1 -S 0 emission), while at 77 K, emission occurs from the T 1 state (T 1 -S 0 ). In addition, Yersin and Robertson also confirmed that the restricted flexibility of the Cu coordination sphere caused by the presence of the 6,6 0dimethyl groups in the N^N ligand (Fig. 8a) resulted in a decrease in non-radiative deactivation with a consequent increase of PLQY. 32 A comparison of PL behaviour of [Cu(POP)(Me n bpy)] + complexes in which Me n bpy carries different numbers of Me substituents in differing positions (Table 1) gives a clear conclusion: substitution at the 6-position or 6,6 0 -positions is essential for high PLQY values (Table 1). Similar trends are seen for analogous xantphos-containing compounds (Table 1 For some of the compounds in Table 1, emission data at 77 K have been reported and are presented in Table 2. In all cases, the longer decay time at 77 K vs. than at 300 K is consistent with TADF at ambient temperatures, even for complexes containing the parent bpy ligand. The second effect is a red-shift in the emission (compare l em max (PL) at ca. 300 K in Table 1 with values at 77K in Table 2). For the compounds in Table 2, calculated values of DE ST are between 0. [Cu(xantphos)(6-tBubpy)][PF 6 ] are 1.1 and 9.6%, and t = 0.4 and 3.3 ms, respectively, values that are significantly lower than many of the methyl-substituted derivatives in Table 1. 98 Some of the best performing copper-based LECs have been achieved using electroluminophores comprising [Cu(POP)-(N^N)][PF 6 ] salts in which N^N is a simple derivative of bpy (Table 3). Most noteworthy is a LEC containing [Cu(xantphos)-(4,5,6-Me 3 bpy)][PF 6 ] with the device architecture shown in Fig. 8c. This reached a maximum luminance of 462 cd m À2 and exhibited a device half-life of up to 98 hours. However, turn-on times are typically of the order of minutes or hours (Table 3). Faster turn-on times have been observed for LECs containing [Cu(xantphos)(6-Phbpy)][PF 6 ] (6-Phbpy = 6-phenyl-2,2 0 -bipyridine), but this is at the expense of luminance (Lum max = 5 cd m À2 ). 37 Included in Table 3 is A noteworthy feature of the LEC with [Cu(POP)(6-EtObpy)][PF 6 ] in the emitting layer was the relatively long device lifetime; the time for the EL to decay to half the maximum luminance was 200 hours. 100 The electron-donating properties of the MeO substituents have also been exploited by Barolo, Costa and coworkers in LECs containing [Cu(POP) (6,6</p>
        <p>has a PLQY of 14%, and in thin-film, this increases to 20% (l exc = 370 nm); TADF behaviour was not investigated. However, in terms of this review, this work is noteworthy for a change in LEC design aimed at minimizing the irreversible formation of Cu(II) species. By using the bilayer LEC architecture shown in Fig. 8d, the goal was to decouple hole/electron injection and transport. 101 In 2017, Weber et al. published the results of an informative investigation correlating the effect of the s-Hammett parameter, s p , of the substituents in the N^N ligands 4,4 0 -Me 2 bpy, 4,4 0 -(MeO) 2 bpy, bpy and 4,4 0 -(O 2 N) 2 bpy (Scheme 4) on the PL and EL properties of [Cu(xantphos)(N^N)][BF 4 ]. The presence of MeO groups (with the most negative s p ) leads to the highest solid-state PLQY (18.9% compared to 9.7% for N^N = 4,4 0 -Me 2 bpy, 0.51% for unsubstituted bpy, and no emission for N^N = 4,4 0 -(O 2 N) 2 bpy). The latter is attributed to the different nature of the lowest excited state of [Cu(xantphos)(4,4 0 -(O 2 N) 2 bpy)] + compared to that of the other members of this series of Cu-iTMCs. The absorption spectrum of [Cu(xantphos)(4,4 0 -(O 2 N) 2 bpy)][BF 4 ] exhibits a broad band centred at 503 nm with a shoulder at 423 nm (not present in compounds with 4,4 0 -Me 2 bpy, 4,4 0 -(MeO) 2 bpy and bpy), and these are assigned to combinations of d-d, MLCT and intraligand transitions. There is a linear relationship between the s p values of the 4,4 0 -substituents in the bpy ligand and the values of l em max (PL) for solid [Cu(xantphos)(N^N)][BF 4 ] (l exc = 376 nm): 545 nm for N^N = 4,4 0 -(MeO) 2 bpy, 570 nm for 4,4 0 -Me 2 bpy, and 600 nm for bpy. 102 This latter value compares with 587 nm reported for powdered [Cu(xantphos)(bpy)][PF 6 ] (l exc = 365 nm). 61 Critically, Weber et al. note that the TADF effect in the Cu-iTMCs may depend upon the s p value of the 4,4 0 -substituents in the bpy ligand. The structure of the [Cu(xantphos)(4,4 0 -(MeO) 2 bpy)] + cation is depicted in Fig. 9a andb and it is worth noting that the p-stacking interaction between two phenyl rings of different PPh 2 units is a common feaure in [Cu(xantphos)(N^N)] + complexes. Testing of LECs with the architecture shown in Fig. 9c and with [Cu(xantphos)(N^N)][BF 4 ] (N^N = 4,4 0 -Me 2 bpy, 4,4 0 -(MeO) 2 bpy, bpy and 4,4 0 -(O 2 N) 2 bpy) in the active layer (no IL was added) led to the conclusions that (i) nitro groups (positive s p ) gave no EL even though charge injection occurred, and (ii) methoxy groups (most negative s p ) resulted in the highest luminance (54 cd m À2 ) and the most stable devices. 102 The correlations established in this work may provide a basis for further development of structure-property relationships in Cu-iTMCs.</p>
        <p>The effects of electron-withdrawing (CN, Cl, Br, CF 3 ) and electron-donating (OH) groups in the 6-and 6,6 0 -positions of bpy (Scheme 4) on the PL and EL properties of [Cu(P) 2 (N^N)] + and [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + complexes have been explored in a series 102 discussed earlier, it is pertinent to note that the Hammett parameter, s p , for CF 3 is +0.54. 104 Compounds containing 5,5 0 -(CF 3 ) 2 bpy were poorly emissive, even in the solid state. As well as providing insight into the effects of introducing CF 3 substituents, our study in 2018 61 returned to the simple [Cu(POP)(bpy)] + complex first reported in 2011, 59 The focus of the study was the ability to tune emission maxima through altering the p-accepting ability of the phosphane ligand and electronic properties of the diimine ligand, and the EL characteristics were not explored. 103 The bpy-containing derivatives overviewed in this section represent the largest group of N^N ligands in heteroleptic Cu-iTMCs that exhibit TADF and have been tested in LECs. For this pair of compounds, the introduction of the Ph groups leads to slightly higher PLQY (11.3 vs. 15.0%) and longer t (14.08 vs. 17.72 ms) in a PMMA thin-film, but has little effect on the powdered material (36.6 vs. 35.3%, 12.75 vs. 11.72 ms). 60 In order to restrict the flattening of the [Cu(P^P)(phen)] + coordination sphere upon excitation, substituents in the 2-or 2,9-positions of phen are required. 60 In view of the known relevance of intra-cation p-contacts (see above), it is pertinent to summarize typical structural features of [Cu(P^P)(phen)] + complexes. 12b shows that one substituent of 2,9-Me 2 phen is accommodated in the cavity of the xanthene unit (compare with Fig. 10). In addition, the P^P and N^N ligands associate through CHÁ Á Áp contacts (Fig. 12c) between Ph units of xantphos and the {Cu(phen)} unit. In keeping with [Cu(xantphos)(bpy)] + cations (see earlier), [Cu(xantphos)(2,9-Me 2 phen)] + exhibits a p-stacking interaction between adjacent PPh 2 units within the xantphos domain (Fig. 12c). These interactions should be compared with typical intramolecular interactions in POP-containing derivatives, exemplified by [Cu(POP)(2,9-Me 2 phen)] + . The CSD contains the structures of several salts of the latter, and two face-to-face p-stacking contacts recur, but appear to be mutually exclusive (see the later discussion of [Cu(POP)(5)][BF 4 ]). The first is between the phen unit and one phenyl ring of a PPh 2 unit of POP. This interaction occurs in the tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate salt of [Cu(POP)(2,9-Me 2 phen)] + (Fig. 13a). 106 The second involves one PPh 2 phenyl ring and an arene ring of the POP backbone as seen in [Cu(POP)(2,9-Me 2 phen)][BF 4 ] (Fig. 12b, compare with Fig. 6). 107 the cation (Fig. 12c) shows a p-stacking contact of the type shown in Fig. 12b, but the metrics of the interaction are not optimal. The same is true in [Cu(POP)(2,9-Me 2 phen)][PF 6 ]Á0.5Et 2 O (CSD refcode CAPZID) 109 and in [Cu(POP)(2,9-Me 2 phen)][BF 4 ]ÁCH 2 Cl 2 (CSD refcode EDOCIJ). 110 These examples illustrate that in crystalline materials, crystallization conditions and the nature of the anion, play important roles in determining, not only lattice packing interactions, but also intra-cation p-contacts. They also indicate that structural data from a single-crystal structure may not necessarily translate to, for example, a thin-film or frozen matrix.</p>
        <p>The 3) with the same architectures as shown in Fig. 8.</p>
        <p>The LECs were driven by pulsed current and under an average current density of 100 A m À2 . The LEC with [Cu(POP)(2-Etphen)][PF6] gave instantaneous EL, with an initial luminance of 273 cd m À2 increasing over 25 minutes to a Lum max of 451 cd m À2 . Although the LEC continued to emit light for 24 hours, the EL decay from Lum max to half this value was rapid (5.7 hours). Compared to the latter, LECs based on [Cu(xantphos)(2-Etphen)][PF 6 ] were slower to turn on (122 minutes to reach Lum max ) and had less intense EL (Lum max = 153 cd m À2 ), but a longer device lifetime (up to 98 hours). 98 These data should encourage further investigations with [Cu(POP/xantphos)(phen)] + -based electroluminophores in which the phen ligand bears a simple alkyl-substitution pattern. The introduction of bromo-substituents leads to weak emitters in solution, but powdered [Cu(POP)(2,9-Br 2 phen)][PF 6 ] and [Cu(xantphos)(2,9-Br 2 phen)][PF 6 ] (l em max (PL) = 574 and 554 nm) exhibit PLQYs of 24 and 45%, and excited-state lifetimes of 6.3 and 9.9 ms, respectively. The photophysical properties of the complexes containing 2,9-phen are enhanced with respect to analogues containing 3,8-or 4,7-dibromo-1,10-phenanthrolines. 111 More detailed investigations of these compounds have not been carried out.</p>
        <p>In Se atom contributed to decreasing the PL lifetime to ca. 800 ns. This was claimed to be the lowest reported to date (2020) among similar TADF materials. 112 Pyrazolyl pyridine derivatives with POP Typically, the bpy and phen-containing compounds described in the previous sections are orange, yellow or green emitters. Moving from bpy or phen to an N^N ligand comprising pyridine connected to a 5-membered N-heterocycle alters the bite angle of the chelating ligand and increases its ligand-field strength. This is a proven means of shifting emissions of [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + complexes towards the blue.</p>
        <p>Series of strongly green/blue-or blue-emitting [Cu(POP)(N^N)]-[BF 4 ] compounds have been reported in which N^N is pzpy, 3-Mepzpy or 3-CF 3 -pzpy (Scheme 6 and Fig. 15a) 113 and t Bupzmpy, Phpzmpy or Adpzmpy (Scheme 6). 114 For the first series with pzpy, 3-Mepzpy or 3-CF 3 -pzpy, PLQYs of up to 45% were observed in deaerated CH 2 Cl 2 solution, and for solid-state [Cu(POP)(N^N)][BF 4 ] (l em max = 490, 465 and 492 nm for N^N = pzpy, 3-Mepzpy and 3-CF 3pzpy, respectively), the PLQYs were 56, 87 and 75%, respectively. The temperature dependence of the emission lifetimes and redshifts in l em max (PL) on going from 298 to 77 K, established TADF at ambient temperatures with DE ST lying in the range 0.17-0.18 eV.</p>
        <p>The highest solid-state PLQY (87% for N^N = 3-Mepzpy) corresponded to the shortest t value (12.2 ms). Solution-processed OLEDs were fabricated using the three [Cu(POP)(N^N)][BF 4 ] salts with either DPEPO or PYD2 (also abbreviated in the literature to 26mCPy) as host materials (Fig. 15b). The best EL performance was found for [Cu(POP)(3-CF 3 -pzpy)][BF 4 ]: PYD2 with the relative LUMO energies of [Cu(POP)(3-CF 3 -pzpy)][BF 4 ] (À2.49 eV) and PYD2 (À2.2 eV) contributing to an efficient electron-hole recombination pathway. A Lum max of 2033 cd m À2 was achieved for this device. 113 This work was extended to [Cu(POP)(N^N)][BF 4 ] with N^N = 6-10 (Scheme 6) and these are highly-efficient TADF emitters. Structural characterization of all five compounds confirms that the steric requirements of the substituents in the pzpy ligands do not preclude intra-POP p-stacking (Fig. 16a). Solid materials were intense blue-green or blue emitters (l em max in the range 464 to 481 nm at 298 K, PLQY = 82-99%) with a red-shift for spectra recorded at 77 K (l em max in the range 487 to 513 nm). On doping in PMMA, all the Cu-iTMCs show sky-blue emissions, and for all but [Cu(POP)( 8)][BF 4 ], t values increase with decreasing rigidity of the matrix. 115</p>
        <p>The search for blue-emitting Cu-based LECs takes us from pyrazolyl-to imidazolyl-containing Cu-iTMCs. Ligand 11 (Scheme 7) was incorporated into [Cu(POP)( 11)][PF 6 ] which gave a deep-blue emission at ca. 450 nm in solution, thin-film and the solid state. The structure of the [Cu(POP)(11)] + cation showed typical features (Fig. 16b). Unexpectedly, LECs fabricated with [Cu(POP) (11)][PF 6 ] in the active layer (Fig. 16c) were yellow emitters (EL = 550 nm), with luminances which depended both on the thickness of the active layer and on the pulsed current (1, 2.5, 5 or 7.5 mA). Detailed studies concluded that the origin of this large PL-to-EL shift lay in the fact that [Cu(POP)(11)] + did not exhibit TADF because of the exclusively ligand-centred character of the excited states. The lack of any charge-transfer character in the excited states resulted, respectively, in a blue-fluorescent and yellow phosphorescent PL and EL. 116 Ligands 12 and 13 were designed to possess intra-ligand charge-transfer character. Each of Tri-and tetrazolyl pyridine derivatives with POP, xantphos and PPh 3</p>
        <p>The families of N^N ligands with pyridine connected to a 5-membered N-heterocycle include a number of triazole and tetrazole derivatives (Scheme 8), and, of course, the presence of an NH unit gives the potential for deprotonation accompanying coordination and the formation of a neutral rather than cationic Cu(I) heteroleptic complexes. The pK a values of triazole (pK a = 9.4) and tetrazole (pK a = 4.9) account for the fact that in the examples below, H15 binds to Cu(I) as the conjugate base while 14 remains protonated.</p>
        <p>Xu et al. have reported the TADF emitters [Cu(PPh 3 ) 2 ( 14)]-[BF 4 ] and [Cu(POP)( 14)][BF 4 ]. The low intensity absorption maxima at 362 and 342 nm, respectively, were assigned to MLCT and ligand-to-ligand (LLCT) transitions. Solution emissions were weak, but in the solid state, emissions with l em max (PL) = 490 and 512 nm with PLQYs of 89.97 and 27.82%, respectively, for [Cu(PPh 3 ) 2 ( 14)][BF 4 ] and [Cu(POP)( 14)][BF 4 ] were observed. Interestingly, it is the PPh 3 , and not the wide bite-angle POP, derivative that performs the better of the two compounds. At 298 K, the excited-state decay times are 23.6 and 13.0 ms and these increase to 269.0 and 210.1 ms at 77 K. Values of DE ST are 0.09 and 0.04 eV (ca. 700 and 300 cm À1 ), and these data, accompanied by the red-shift in l em max (PL) to 508 and 520 nm for [Cu(PPh 3 ) 2 ( 14)][BF 4 ] and [Cu(POP)( 14)][BF 4 ], respectively, support TADF at ambient temperatures. Multilayer OLEDs were processed using these ionic complexes with 4,4 0 ,4 0 0 -tris(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine as the host material. The OLEDs with [Cu(PPh 3 ) 2 ( 14)][BF 4 ] and [Cu(POP)( 14)][BF 4 ] showed green emissions (l em max (EL) to 520 and 539 nm), and the POP-containing electroluminophore yielded the higher Lum max (1871 vs. 1437 cd m À2 ), with the smaller DE ST being a contributing factor. 10 A small DE ST (ca. 0.18 eV, 1500 cm À1 ) separation is also found for the neutral compound [Cu(POP) (15)], and a detailed theoretical investigation demonstrated that low-frequency vibrational modes associated with the torsional motion of the POP and N^N ligands lead to substantial Huang-Rhys factors 117 and, thereby, to rapid ISC and RISC (see Fig. 2). 118 Related studies which address the effects of both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions on photophysical properties, have been carried out on the cationic TADF emitters [Cu(POP)( 16)] + and [Cu(POP)(17)] + . 119 These complexes exhibit both aggregation induced emission (AIE) and TADF. For the former phenomenon, enhanced emission in the solid state (as opposed to in solution) arises from molecular aggregation that restricts intramolecular rotation.</p>
        <p>[Cu(POP)( 16)][BF 4 ] and [Cu(POP) (17)][BF 4 ] are virtually nonemissive in CH 2 Cl 2 solutions, but thin-films spin-coated from CH 2 Cl 2 solution were bright emitters (l em max (PL) = 533 and 572 nm for N^N = 16 and 17) with very short decay times. In this form, the Cu-iTMCs were principally TADF emitters over a 320-170 K temperature range. Between 170 and 80 K, phosphorescence was the dominant decay path. A comparison of the PL of thin-films made with [Cu(POP)( 16)][BF 4 ] and [Cu(POP) (17)][BF 4 ] in low-or high-molecular weight PMMA showed that the different PMMA hosts were able to suppress molecular vibrations to different extents. In low molecular weight PMMA, TADF contributed little to the emission, with vibrational quenching being most effective and ambient (rather than lower) temperatures. Moving to the high molecular weight PMMA leads to greater suppression of molecular vibrations within the Cu-iTMCs and opens up the TADF pathway. Ligands 16 and 17 differ only in the position of the methyl substituent in the tetrazole (Scheme 8). This leads to significant differences in crystal packing with the inter-cation interactions resulting in a 3D-supramolecular assembly in [Cu(POP)( 16 It follows that there is less distortion of the excited state of the complex with 16, and consistent with this notion is the fact that the solid-state PLQY of [Cu(POP)( 16)][BF 4 ] (47.1%) is higher than that of [Cu(POP) (17)][BF 4 ] (9.4%). Both complexes are put forward as potential candidates for lighting devices. 120 Derivatives of di(pyridin-2-yl)sulfane and related N^N ligands with POP Scheme 9 shows a series of new N^N ligands incorporated into heteroleptic copper(I) coordination compounds, and designed with S in two different oxidation states. Unexpectedly, whereas 18 and 19 behave as N,N 0 -chelating ligands and form distorted tetrahedral [Cu(POP)(N^N)] + complexes, ligand 20 gives a dinuclear complex with three-coordinate Cu(I) and bridging POP (Fig. 17a), while 21 behaves as an N,S-chelating ligand (Fig. 17b), and 22 and 23 bind through N-and O-donors in mono-and dinuclear complexes, respectively (Fig. 17c andd</p>
        <p>The commercial accessibility of POP and xantphos contribute towards their being the most popular wide-bite angle bis-(phosphanes) in heteroleptic copper(I) compounds. However, the pool of ligands that fall in this category is large, 56 and in this section, we focus on other sterically demanding P^P ligands (Scheme 10) that have been used to stablize [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + complexes.</p>
        <p>Earlier, we described the small DE ST (ca. 0.18 eV, 1500 cm À1 ) separation in the tetrazole-containing [Cu(POP)( 15)], and theoretical studies indicate that introducing methyl substituents into the backbone of POP to give Me 2 POP (Scheme 15) has little effect on the T 1 -S 1 energy gap. 118 There appear to be no experimental investigations of the effects on the properties of [Cu(POP)(N^N)] + -type complexes of modifying the POP ligand, and there are only limited studies on complexes incorporating modified xantphos ligands. In 2019, we reported the use of the (Fig. 18a ). 123 Thus, the modifications of xantphos, either with bulky peripheral groups, or with P-substituents more sterically demanding that phenyl, do not appear to enhance PL or EL properties, and these latter investiagtions tend to suggest that, with xantphos at least, the choice of N^N ligand is the dominant factor.</p>
        <p>Despite being commercially available, HN-xantphos (Scheme 10) has received far less attention than xantphos, especially with respect to heteroleptic copper(I) coordination compounds. [124][125][126][127][128][129] We focus on those studies directed towards applications in LECs. We have already seen that among some of the best performing LEC-emitters are [Cu(xantphos)( 6 1 with l em max (PL) undergoing a blue shift, and PLQY and t increasing on going from bpy to 6-Mebpy to 6,6 0 -Me 2 bpy. Although the calculated values of DE ST (0.14-0.20 eV, ca. 1100-1600 cm À1 ) are small enough to allow RISC to occur (Fig. 2), an analysis of the oscillator strengths for electronic transitions suggests that the RISC process leads to non-radiative decay rather than TADF. Because of the high solid-state PLQY of [Cu(BnN-xantphos)(6,6 0 Me 2 bpy)][PF 6 ], this compound was selected for inclusion in the active layer of LECs, the latter being fabriacted as shown in Fig. 19b. An interesting aspect of this investigation was the effect of using commercial PEDOT: PSS with different weight ratios in the hole-injection layer. The time to reach a luminance of 100 cd m À2 was only 7 s with 1 : 20 PEDOT: PSS for LECs driven using current densities of 50 or 100 A m À2 . In contrast, this turn-on time was 185 s (at 50 A m À2 ) or 12 s (at 100 A m À2 ) for the 1 : 6 PEDOT: PSS. It is the latter composition that is most commonly employed in LECs. Values of Lum max also depended on the PEDOT: PSS composition, reaching 203 or 355 cd m À2 . Overall, the LECs with [Cu(BnN-xantphos)(6,6 0 -Me 2 bpy)][PF 6 ] showed good lifetimes, intense EL and EQE 41%, making them some of the best performing devices with [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + emitters. 127 The chiral BIPHEP ligand (Scheme 10) is also commercially available and the racemic form was used to prepare [Cu(BIPHEP)- red-shift in l em max (583 to 590 nm) on going from 298 to 77 K, suggesting that, for example, non-radiative decay is operative. For N^N = bpy, despite the red-shift in l em max (PL) from 566 to 615 nm (298 to 77 K), there was little change in the decay lifetime (3 to 7 ms). With the highest PLQY of the series, [Cu(BIPHEP)(5,5 0 -Me 2 bpy)][PF 6 ] was used as the electroluminophore in a LEC of configuration glass-ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Cu-iTMC/ Al but the highest Lum max , even with a current density of 100 A m À2 , was only 12 cd m À2 and the maximum EQE was 0.03%. 130 Since bpy, 6-Mebpy, 6-Etbpy and 5,5 0 -Me 2 bpy have proven promising with POP, xantphos and BnN-xantphos, it might be concluded that BIPHEP is not a high priority wide-bite angle ligand for further exploration in these types of luminescent compounds.</p>
        <p>Several [Cu(dppnc)(N^N)] compounds have been reported with the 7,8-dicarba-nido-undecaborate The additional rigidity of the phen unit compared to bpy leads to a higher allowedness of the S 1 -S 0 transition, greater efficiency of RISC (Fig. 2) and a higher stability of the T 1 state; all factors lead to favourable TADF. Of the compounds studied, [Cu(dppnc)(7,10-Me 2 pyrphen)] proved to exhibit the best combination of small DE ST (1380 cm À1 , 0.17 eV), high and low rates, respectively, of fluorescence and phosphorescence decays, fast RISC, and a short lifetime of the delayed fluorescence. Zou and coworkers recommend [Cu(dppnc)(7,10-Me 2 pyrphen)] as a candidate for synthesis. 132 Judicious functionalization of the phen-based N^N ligands 24-26 (Scheme 11) resulted in [Cu(dppnc)(N^N)] complexes with EL in solution-processed OLEDs spanning from green for [Cu(dppnc) (24)] to red for [Cu(dppnc) (26)]. Although the differences in [Cu(dppnc) (24)], [Cu(dppnc) (25)] and [Cu(dppnc) (26)] lie in peripheral functionalities and, therefore, the Cu(I) coordination environment is essentially the same in each compound, the solution emission lifetimes vary from 1.0 ms for [Cu(dppnc)(26)] to 5.5 ms for [Cu(dppnc) (24)]. Che and coworkers relate this difference to the values of DE ST which are calculated to be 1121 cm À1 (0.14 eV) for [Cu(dppnc) (24)], 1629 cm À1 (0.20 eV) for [Cu(dppnc) (25)] and 2073 cm À1 (0.26 eV) for [Cu(dppnc) (26)]. The DE ST separations are therefore in line with TADF, which is further supported by extended solid-state decay lifetimes on going from 298 to 77 K, e.g. 15.3 to 1145.7 ms for [Cu(dppnc) (24)]. The compounds were incorporated as dopants in solution-processed OLEDs, and the green-emitting device with [Cu(dppnc) (24)] achieved an EQE of 15.20%. 133 The aminophosphane derivatives P 2 pip and P 2 Me 2 en (Scheme 10) have been incorporated into the emissive compounds [Cu(P 2 pip)(phen)][BF 4 ] and [Cu(P 2 Me 2 en)(phen)][BF 4 ]. At 298 K, values of l em max (PL) are 573 and 617 nm, respectively, and a red-shift is observed on going to 77 K (to 587 and 647 nm, respectively), consistent with TADF. This is also supported by the temperature dependence of the decay lifetimes. No device data were reported. 134</p>
        <p>While [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + compounds dominate the families of Cu-iTMC TADF emitters investigated to date, variations on this coordination pattern also lead to some promising emissive materials, with TADF being established in a number of cases. In this section, we summarize progress made with [Cu(P)(tripodal-N 3 )] + and [Cu(P)(N^N)(N)] + coordination motifs, and in the next section, we look at softer donor sets involving sulfur.</p>
        <p>Earlier, we described the PL and EL behaviours of [Cu 2 (triphos) 2 (m-4,4 0 -bpy)][BF 4 ] 2 (Fig. 3). 49 This complex contained {Cu I (N)-(tripodal-P 3 )} coordination motifs. In contrast, {Cu I (P)(tripodal-N 3 )} . This compound was incorporated as the electroluminophore in a LEC, but exhibited poor EL and poor charge transporting properties. 139 The neutral complex [Cu(dppb)( 35 l em max (PL) of a pristine thin-film (ca. 554 nm). Under a driving voltage of 5 V, the LEC had a fast a turn-on to reach a Lum max of 108 cd m À2 . However, the decay of the EL was rapid. A longer EL lifetime was achieved at the expense of brightness with a 4 V driving voltage. This contribution from Bru ¨ggeler and De Cola in 2014 is noteworthy for being a relatively early report of TADF heteroleptic copper(I) emitters proven to function in LECs. 143 We now move to polynuclear copper(I) complexes featuring bridging N-donor ligands. The majority are neutral compounds and are included because of some notable PL and device performances. [Cu 2 (POP) 2 (m-37) 2 ] (Fig. 22d), [Cu 2 (POP) ], respectively. The promising PL properties of these compounds led to them being used as electroluminophores in solution-processed, multilayer OLEDs with PYD2 (see Fig. 15) as the host material. The OLED with [Cu 2 (POP) 2 (m-39) 2 ] exhibited the highest values of EQE (8.3%) and Lum max (2525 cd m À2 ), with the hole-transporting properties of the carbazole group in 39 contributing to the performance. 144 In 2019, Titov et al. reported the first example of a cyclic tricopper(I) pyrazolate displaying TADF behaviour. 145 [Cu 3 (dppm) (40) 3 ] (Scheme 14 shows H40, and dppm = bis(diphenylphosphano)methane) contains two Cu(I) centres bridged by both N^N and P^P domains and one two-coordinate Cu(I) bound only by N-donors (Fig. 23a). The authors comment that the photophysical properies are influenced by intramolecular structural features rather than by intermolecular interactions. It is worth noting, therefore, that the crystal structure of [Cu 3 (dppm) (40) 3 ] exhibits p-stacking between two Ph rings of dppm (Fig. 23b), reminiscent of the intra-POP interactions described earlier. On going from 298 to 77 K, the solid-state emission of [Cu 3 (dppm) (40) 3 ] shifts from 514 to 554 nm, and t increases from 32.7 to 148.6 ms, consistent with TADF behaviour. The value of DE ST derived from experimental data is estimated to be 1080 AE 60 cm À1 (0.13 AE 0.01 eV). The PL properties suggest that this and related trinuclear species may find applications in lighting devices, but no relevant OLED data are yet available.</p>
        <p>The metallopolymer [41][BF 4 ] 2n was prepared by condensation of [3,3 0 -bipyridine]-6,6 0 -dicarbaldehyde and 1,1 0 -biphenyl-4,4 0diamine in the presence of Cu(BF 4 ) 2 and POP. A DMF solution of the polymer gave an emission with l em max (PL) = 780 nm, but after heating at 160 1C, a yellow gel formed for which l em max (PL) = 580 nm; cooling reversed the sol-gel transition. The changes were attributed to reversibie dissociation of the complex. LECs were fabricated using an architecture similar to that shown in Fig. 22c, with a 100 AE 20 nm active layer and 100 nm Al cathode layer. With an onset voltage of ca. 4 V, a value of Lum max = 3 cd m À2 was reached. At low bias, the EL was in the IR region, but an increase in voltage produced a blue-shift eventually giving yellow EL. The process was reversible and, by analogy with the solgel transition, was explained in terms of reversible dissociation of [Cu(POP)] + domains from the organic polymer backbone. Although TADF was not demonstrated in this system, the investigation is of relevance for this review in terms of establishing the effects of heat on PL and of higher bias in LECs containing heteroleptic copper(I) emitters. 146 Copper(I) complexes with N-heterocyclic carbenes N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are characterized by exhibiting strong s-donating and weak p-accepting properties. The potential for employing NHC ligands in emissive three-coordinate copper(I) compounds was described by Thompson and coworkers between 2010 and 2014. [147][148][149] In 2019, Danopoulos et al. provided a thorough overview of the field of NHC copper complexes including cyclic alkyl-amino carbenes (cAACs), 150 and we have therefore chosen to focus on early pivotal investigations, and then on Cu-iTMCs (i.e. ionic complexes) which incorporate NHC ligands. 24) such that there is an increase in the HOMO-LUMO separation. An important structural feature of this series of heteroleptic complexes is intramolecular, inter-ligand CHÁ Á Áp interactions between pyridine CH and N-phenyl substituents (Fig. 24c). 151 This interaction appears to be especially important in improving the air and moisture stability of the compounds in the solid state. 153 The investigations of [Cu(N^N)(NHC)] + Cu-iTMCs were extended to a wider range of NHC (Scheme 15) and py 2 NH-type N^N (Scheme 16) ligands in order to establish structure-property relationships and to demonstrate TADF in three-coordinate [Cu(N^N)(NHC)] + complexes. 154 In respect of the N^N ligands, the presence of electron-donating groups (Me, OMe) leads to a blue-shifted emission, whereas electronwithdrawing groups (CF 3 ) cause a red-shift; going from Fast turn-on with values of Lum max = 6.2 and 13 cd m À2 and efficacy = 0.19 and 0.39 cd A À1 , respectively, were achieved at the lowest applied current (0.5 mA). 155 The development of NHC Cu-iTMCs for blue-and green-emitting LECs has gained momentum, but as previously mentioned, degradation of [Cu(N^N)(NHC)] + species during solution processing is problematical. An important contribution which addesses device optimization demonstrates the use of ionic additives, as well as a hole transporter. With such modifications, the Lum max of LECs containing [Cu(py 2 NH)( 42)][PF 6 ] could be boosted from 20 to 160 cd m À2 , and the efficiency from 0.17</p>
        <p>In this final section dealing with NHC-containing Cu-iTMCs, we focus on four-coordinate [Cu(POP)(NHC)] + complexes, in which the NHC ligand carries a substituent which acts as an N-donor (Scheme 17). [Cu(POP)( 49 49)][PF 6 ], the emission decay was monoexponential at 298 K, and a biexponential fit was used at 77 K. In contrast, bi-and triexponential fits were applied for the emission decays of [Cu(POP)( 50)][PF 6 ] at 298 and 77 K, respectively. Analysis of the solid-state emission behaviour leads to the conclusion that both compounds are predominantly TADF emitters at 298 K, with a phosphorescence component. 158 This first contribution from Wang et al. focused on the effects of extending the p-conjugation in the NHC ligand (49 vs. 50). 158 In a later investigation from the same group, the effects of introducing electron-donating Me and OMe or electron-withdrawing F or Cl substituents (NHCs 51-54) were explored. 159 max with the electronic properties of the NHC ligands is not straightforward. However, DFT calculations indicate that both HOMO and LUMO contain NHC character giving a rationale as to why the observed trends in emission maxima do not follow directly from the electron-withdrawing/donating properties of the Me, OMe, F and Cl substituents. At 77 K, l em max values are redshifted with respect to 298 K and emission decay times are longer. As for the parent compound [Cu(POP)( 49)][PF 6 ], it is concluded that emission at ambient temperatures has both phosphoresence and TADF components. 159 More recently, this family of compounds has been extended by Zhao and coworkers to [Cu(POP)( 55)][PF 6 ] (l em max (PL) = 493 nm at 298 K), and the photophysical properties were compared to those of [Cu(POP)( 51)][PF 6 ] (l em max (PL) = 487 nm), again with the conclusion that both phosphorescence and TADF contribute to emission at ambient temperatures. 160 We note that the solid-state emission behaviour of [Cu(POP)( 51)][PF 6 ] has been independently reported by Wang, Xu and coworkers 159 and by Zhao and coworkers. 160 In the initial report, the room temperature PLQY of solid [Cu(POP)( 51)][PF 6 ] was reported as 61%. 159 In contrast, Zhao and coworkers determined a PLQY of 100%. 160 Whether this is a consequence of different sample morphologies 32 remains unclear. No applications of this family of four-coordinate [Cu(POP)(NHC)] + emitters in LECs have been reported to date, despite the rather promising photophsyical behaviours.</p>
        <p>Over the last ten years, there has been growing interest in the development of luminescent heteroleptic copper(I) coordination compounds. These developments encompass both neutral compounds which may have applications in OLEDs and cationic complexes with potential use in either LECs or OLEDs. This review has focused mainly on Cu-iTMCs, but we have included neutral coordination compounds such as the series of [Cu(POP)(pz 2 BH 2 )], [Cu(POP)(pz 2 BPh 2 )] and [Cu(POP)(pz 4 B)] 62 which were pivotal along the road to recognizing that heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes could exhibit TADF. Among the families of emissive Cu-iTMCs, the most commonly encountered are distorted tetrahedral [Cu(P^P)(N^N)] + complexes in which P^P is a large-bite angle bis(phosphane) and N^N is a diimine or related ligand. Although initial investigations demonstrated high PLQYs and promising performances in LECs, it was not until low temperature PL measurements became routine that the widespread nature of TADF in Cu-iTMCs was recognized. Thus, in some cases, Cu-iTMCs were not described as TADF emitters even though the phenomenon was present. There have been a number of endeavours to develop structureproperty relationships to assist the synthetic chemist in ligand design, 57,60,102,154 but often, simple ligands such as 6,6 0 -Me 2 bpy or 2,9-Me 2 phen have proved to be the best performing. It is critical that the N^N ligand possesses appropriate substituents to prevent flattening of the coordination sphere excited state. As far as widebite angle bis(phosphanes) are concerned, POP and xantphos remain the most popular, but RN-xantphos ligands (derived from the commercially available HN-xantphos) deserve further exploitation in [Cu(RN-xantphos)(N^N)] + coordination compounds.</p>
        <p>Most of the heteroleptic copper(I) complexes incorporating N-and P-donor ligands are red, orange or yellow emitters. Colour tuning into the blue region of the spectrum has been most notably achieved by moving to NHC-containing compounds. This area remains a valuable playground for the synthetic chemist.</p>
        <p>Our longstanding interest in structural chemistry has led us to put an emphasis in this review on solid-state structural features such as p-stacking interactions and other inter-ligand interactions which may impact on PLQYs. Since it has been established that, for [Cu(P^P)(phen)] + derivatives, there is a direct relationship between the number of intramolecular p-interactions in the ground state and the PLQY value, 60 it is invaluable to correlate crystal-structural features with solid-state photophysical behaviour.</p>
        <p>Finally, although we have, where possible, reported LEC performances, it is difficult to compare device figures-of-merit because of the differing LEC configurations and operating conditions. There are only a few investigations that focus on device optimization for a given Cu-iTMC electroluminophore, and we conclude that this is one area that is ripe for future development.</p>

        <p>We first consider species in which the Cu(I) centres are bridged by bis-or tetrakisphosphano ligands. We have already discussed the dinuclear complexes [Cu 2 (20) 2 (m-POP)] 2+ (a rare example in which POP is in a bridging mode) and [Cu 2 (POP) 2 (m-22)] 2+ (in which the sulfone 22 coordinates to two Cu(I) centres through two N,O-donor sets). 121 A number of dinuclear complexes feature N^N ligands of the types previously discussed and bridging bisphosphanes. [Cu 2 (2,9-Me 2 phen) 2 (m-dppa) 2 ][BF 4 ] 2 (dppa = bis(diphenylphosphano)ethyne) is poorly emissive in solution (PLQY = 1%); in a PMMA film at 298 K, the PLQY is 6% and this increases to 56% at 77 K. However, the emission maximum at 77 K has vibrational structure, indicative of 3 pp* character of the emission, and this behaviour for the dinuclear species contrasts with that of the related mononuclear [Cu(xantphos)(2,9-Me 2 phen)] + which is a TADF emitter (see earlier). 105 [Cu 2 (36) 2 (m-dppe) 2 ] (H36 is shown in Scheme 14, dppe = bis(diphenylphosphano)ethane) is unusual in that the CH 2 Cl 2 solvate exhibits luminescent vapochromism with a yellow to cyan PL colour change; when the desolvated crystalline material is exposed to CH 2 Cl 2 vapour, PL cyan emission returns to a yellow emission. The effect is selective to CH 2 Cl 2 and is attributed to the accommodation of each CH 2 Cl 2 molecule within a pair of pyridine rings of adjacent [Cu 2 (36) 2 (m-dppe) 2 ] complexes in the lattice. The desolvated solid [Cu 2 (36) 2 (m-dppe) 2 ] has l em max (PL) = 493 nm at room temperature and the emission shifts to 509 nm at 77 K, with the value of t increasing from 24 ms at 350 K to 164 ms at 50 K. These data and the value of DE ST = 0.097 eV (780 cm À1 ) are consistent with TADF behaviour.</p>
        <p>[Cu 2 (36) 2 (m-dppe) 2 ] is readily sublimable and was incorporated into vapour-deposited multilayer OLEDs with 4,4 0 -bis(9-carbazolyl)-2,2 0 -dimethylbiphenyl as the host material in the active layer. Of the doping concentrations used, the best OLED performance was found for 6 wt% of [Cu 2 (36) 2 (m-dppe) 2 ] with values of Lum max = 7217 cd m À2 and EQE max = 7.5%. 141 Earlier, we described the seminal work of Yersin and coworkers in which the TADF behaviour of [Cu(POP)(pz 2 BH 2 )], [Cu(POP)(pz 2 BPh 2 )] and [Cu(POP)(pz 4 B)] (Fig. 6 and associated discussion) was revealed. 62 Related dinuclear compounds are [Cu 2 (pz 4 B) 2 (m-tpbz)] (Fig. 22a) (tpbz = 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(diphenylphosphano)benzene), [Cu 2 (pz 2 BH 2 ) 2 (m-tpbz)] and [Cu 2 (tz 2 -BH 2 ) 2 (m-tpbz)] ([tz 2 BH 2 ] À = bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)borohydrate). Solids samples exhibit yellow-orange PL with l em max (PL) = 580, 569 and 540 nm, respectively, with PLQYs of 7, 28 and 45%, respectively, at 298 K. Extended decay lifetimes upon going from 298 to 77 K are observed (e.g. 11.9 to 29.1 ms for [Cu 2 (pz 2 BH 2 ) 2 (m-tpbz)]). With estimated values of DE ST in the range 0.06 and 0.09 eV (ca. 500-700 cm À1 , corrobated by TD-DFT calculations), the compounds are likely to be TADF emitters at ambient temperatures. However, atypically for TADF, the emission maxima undergo small blue-shifts of between 6 and 10 nm on going from 298 to 77 K. 142</p>
