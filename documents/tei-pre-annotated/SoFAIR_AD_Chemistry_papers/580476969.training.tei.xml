        <p>NRF2 acts by controlling gene expression, being the master regulator of the Phase II antioxidant response, and also being key to the control of neuroinflammation. NRF2 activity is regulated at several levels, including protein degradation by the proteasome, transcription, and post-transcription. The purpose of this review is to offer a concise and critical overview of the main mechanisms of NRF2 regulation and their actual or potential use as targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.NRF2 acts by controlling gene expression, being the master regulator of the Phase II antioxidant response, and also being key to the control of neuroinflammation.

        <p>Over the past decades, life expectancy has been continuously increasing with the subsequent increase in the prevalence of aging-related chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD) and Huntington's (HD) diseases, Friedrich's ataxia (FRDA) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) or stroke, among other types of neurodegenerative maladies [1]. In contrast to the traditional approach of "one disease-one mechanism-one medicine", chronic diseases have a multifactorial etiology, requiring much more precise knowledge of the mechanisms involved in disease development [1].Over the past decades, life expectancy has been continuously increasing with the subsequent increase in the prevalence of aging-related chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD) and Huntington's (HD) diseases, Friedrich's ataxia (FRDA) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) or stroke, among other types of neurodegenerative maladies [1].

        <p>The development of human disease networks has underscored the fact that different diseases (NDDs) may share common molecular mechanisms [2]. Thus, neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a loss of homeostasis involving mitochondrial disfunction, chronic inflammation, metabolic and proteostasis unbalances associated with an increase of oxidative stress, and the pathological formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1].The development of human disease networks has underscored the fact that different diseases (NDDs) may share common molecular mechanisms [2].

        <p>In this context, there is large body of evidence that points to nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) as an attractive, druggable target that is involved in the regulation of multiple cytoprotective responses [1]. In this review, we will present the different mechanisms involved in NRF2 regulation to provide new strategies for drug development against neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).

        <p>After the discovery, in 1994, of the NRF2 transcription factor [4], its involvement in the regulation of the expression of about 250 genes containing an enhancer sequence called antioxidant response element (ARE) was shown [5]. These genes encode several enzymes involved in cellular protection against pro-oxidants, electrophiles or inflammatory agents, biotransformation reactions of xenobiotics, maintenance of mitochondrial function, protein homeostasis, and antioxidative metabolism [6].After the discovery, in 1994, of the NRF2 transcription factor [4], its involvement in the regulation of the expression of about 250 genes containing an enhancer sequence called antioxidant response element (ARE) was shown [5].

        <p>The maintenance of NRF2 levels requires a suitable balance between its synthesis and its proteasomal degradation [7,8]. As summarized in Figure 1, under physiological conditions NRF2 is normally located in the cytosol [7]. KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), the NRF2 main negative regulatory system [7], is able to maintain NRF2 in the cytoplasm to generate a complex with the Cullin 3 (Cul3)/Rbx1-based E3-ubiquitin ligase, inducing NRF2 ubiquitination and the subsequent proteasomal degradation [8]. Thus, NRF2 is constitutively synthesized and rapidly degraded by the proteasome under unstressed conditions [8]. However, in response to oxidative stress, the cysteine residues present in the "sensor" region of KEAP1 are oxidized, leading to a conformational change that releases NRF2 from KEAP1. Alternatively, these cysteine residues can be activated by reaction with electrophiles [9]. Once NRF2 is liberated from KEAP1, it translocates into the nucleus, where it forms heterodimers with different coactivators, such as the sMaf (small masculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma) protein [1,9], and these heterodimers promote the transcription of ARE. Due to its cytoprotective effects, NRF2 activation stands out as a promising goal to fight neurodegeneration processes, which involve mitochondrial disfunction, chronic inflammation, and increased oxidative stress levels [10].The maintenance of NRF2 levels requires a suitable balance between its synthesis and its proteasomal degradation [7,8].

Negative regulation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) under normal conditions and activation under pathological conditions. Under normal conditions, NRF2 is bound to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), maintaining it in the cytosol. KEAP1 acts as adaptor of the Cullin 3 (CuI3) ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates NRF2, leading to its degradation by proteasome 26S. Under pathological conditions, in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or covalent modifiers, the KEAP1 structure is modified, liberating NRF2 in the cytosol; thereafter, it translocates to the nucleus where it forms heterodimers with small masculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (sMaf) proteins to bind the antioxidant response element (ARE) sequences, promoting the expression of phase II genes. This mechanism is known as the "hinge and latch" NRF2 activation mechanism. Moreover, NRF2 is tightly regulated by additional mechanisms. It can be over-activated by the action of p62, since it can induce KEAP1 degradation by the autophagy lysosome pathway. In the opposite, under pathological conditions, in which the kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is over-active, it can directly phosphorylate NRF2, facilitating its interaction with the Cul1 ligase adaptor β-transducing repeat-containing protein (β-TrCp) to induce its degradation.

        <p>NRF2 belongs to the basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, and more specifically to the cap "n" collar (CNC) subfamily [11]. It is formed by seven NRF2-ECH homology domains known as Neh1-7, each with a specific function (Figure 2) [12]. The Neh1 domain contains the CNC-bZIP region that allows NRF2 to recognize DNA, promoting its heterodimerization with partners such as the sMaf protein [13]. The high degree of conservation found in the amino acid sequence of this region across a wide range of species [14] highlights the importance of NRF2 transcriptional activity. Neh2 is responsible for the interaction with KEAP1, the main NRF2 negative regulator [15]. This interaction takes place through the degron motifs present in this domain, namely DLG (low affinity) and ETGE (high affinity) [15]. Moreover, the presence of seven lysine residues, also included in the Neh2 region, promotes NRF2 proteasomal degradation after its ubiquitylation [9]. The C-terminal Neh3, Neh4, and Neh5 are transactivation domains that bind to various components of the transcriptional machinery, which promotes the transcription of NRF2 target genes [16,17]. Neh6 is a serine-rich region containing two conserved peptide motifs, DSGIS and DSAPGS [18]. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is able to phosphorylate the DSGIS sequence, thereby increasing the binding efficiency of β-transducing repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) to Neh6 and promoting NRF2 proteasomal degradation [18]. Finally, Neh7 is responsible for the binding with RXRα (Retinoic acid receptor-alpha) and disrupts the binding of CBP ([CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein)-binding protein]) to the Neh4 and Neh5 domains, inhibiting the transcription of the ARE sequences [19].NRF2 belongs to the basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, and more specifically to the cap "n" collar (CNC) subfamily [11].

The classical NRF2 target genes encode enzymes distributed in several organelles and subcellular compartments [20]. These enzymes participate in metabolic reactions that scavenge ROS and neutralize electrophiles such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase (GR), glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), or NAD(P)H/quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) [20].

        <p>While moderate concentrations of ROS play physiological roles as second messengers [26], an imbalance of ROS concentration leads to oxidative stress and is related with the onset of some pathological processes. Oxidative stress is one of the major hallmarks in neurodegeneration and arises from the combination of ROS hyperproduction with the impairment of antioxidant defenses [27]. This imbalance causes molecular and organelle damage, leading into neuronal death if severe. ROS species, arising from the oxidative metabolism of O 2 , react with unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid [27]. The resulting highly reactive peroxy radicals initiate a chain reaction with nearby fatty acids [28]. Some of these molecules arising from the ROS-promoted chain reactions are characteristic of specific NDDs, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) in AD and PD [28,29], acrolein and F 2 -isoprostanes in AD [30], and malondialdehyde in PD. DNA is also susceptible to suffer oxidative damage, as shown by the increased levels of 8-hydroxyguanine and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine in the brains of PD patients [31]. Acrolein and HNE induce toxicity by crosslinking to cysteine, lysine, and histidine residues through Michael additions [32]. The formation of these adducts damages enzymes and receptors, and it induces DNA mutations, leading to malfunction of a variety of biochemical pathways [32]. Moreover, ROS induce structural alterations in proteins that lead to their misfolding and aggregation [33]. These protein alterations also cause the malfunction of complexes such as voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, contributing to intracellular calcium overload and excitotoxicity [33]. Furthermore, oxidative stress activates redox-sensitive pathways, leading to sustained M 1 microglial activation [34].While moderate concentrations of ROS play physiological roles as second messengers [26], an imbalance of ROS concentration leads to oxidative stress and is related with the onset of some pathological processes.

        <p>Neuroinflammation processes are mediated, mainly, by microglial cells switching from the resting state M 0 to activated states (M 1 or M 2 ) by two different activation pathways [38]. The proinflammatory M 1 phenotype releases proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and increases ROS formation, leading to tissue damage [38]. An alternative activation route promotes the neuroprotective M 2 state, which is involved in tissue regeneration processes and is characterized by the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13) [38]. The imbalance between M 1 /M 2 phenotypes is being extensively studied to understand the complex role of microglia as a neuroprotective or neurodegenerative factor [39].Neuroinflammation processes are mediated, mainly, by microglial cells switching from the resting state M 0 to activated states (M 1 or M 2 ) by two different activation pathways [38].

        <p>NRF2 activation exerts anti-inflammatory properties by reducing the amounts of several proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β (interleukin 1β), IL-6, and the expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in microglia and astrocytes [10,39]. It has been shown that the induction of the NRF2 pathway in the hippocampus and cortex of AD (APP/PSEN1) mice model [40] reduces microgliosis, astrogliosis, and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A. Most importantly, long-term memory decline of AD mice was significantly attenuated [40]. Furthermore, several human studies have demonstrated the cytoprotective properties toward Aβ peptide-induced toxicity achieved by NRF2 activation and related to its anti-inflammatory effects due to a shifting of the microglia state from the M1 to an M2 phenotype [41]. NRF2 activation has been shown to be useful in neuroinflammation attenuation, neuronal survival, and repressing the deleterious effects of activated microglia in ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) mouse models [42]. Similarly, pharmacologically stimulated NRF2 activation repressed inflammatory responses in mouse microglia and astrocytes, the principal cellular mediators of neuroinflammation, and in blood monocytes from HD patients [43].

        <p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) initiate a proinflammatory immune response through the activation of transcription factors such as the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and others, which are associated to the synthesis of proinflammatory molecules (Figure 3).

        <p>The nuclear factor-κB family comprises several proteins that are activated downstream of TLR signaling and lead to an inflammatory response by the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and several interleukins. Its connection with NRF2 is very complex, and its main features are summarized in Figure 5 [48]. NF-κB drives a negative regulation over NRF2 through its monomer p65 by different pathways. p65 promotes the nuclear importation of KEAP1, where it binds to NRF2, concluding the expression of phase II-related genes. Then, the KEAP1-NRF2 complex is exported to the cytosol and coupled to the Cul3 ubiquitin ligase that induces the proteasomal degradation of NRF2. Additionally, GSK-3β directly phosphorylates NRF2, coding its degradation though interaction with β-TrCP. β-TrCP is also able to induce the degradation of IκB (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B), increasing the activity of NF-κB and thus limiting NRF2 activation. On the other hand, KEAP1 stabilizes IκB by inducing the degradation of IKK via proteasomal degradation. Thus, it helps to close the crosstalk between NF-κB and NRF2, creating a fine-tuned loop between inflammation and the antioxidant response.The nuclear factor-κB family comprises several proteins that are activated downstream of TLR signaling and lead to an inflammatory response by the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and several interleukins.

        <p>The misfolding of specific proteins and their subsequent aggregation in a toxic form is the most common feature of NDDs. These aberrant proteins arise from cell stress, mutations, or protein production mistakes [50].

        <p>NRF2 deficiency has been found in several NDDs; for instance, the hippocampal neurons of AD patients showed a dramatic decrease in nuclear NRF2 [59], while animal models of PD, such as NRF2-knockout mice, showed a specific loss of dopaminergic neurons [60] and post-mortem studies of patients with ALS showed an increased KEAP1 mRNA in the motor cortex [61], leading to a decline in NRF2 activity. Other studies showed that tau-and amyloid-injured neurons contain increased levels of NRF2 and its target protein sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62), probably as a clearance mechanism to release these toxic proteins through autophagy [23,62]. In consonance with these results, the levels of HO-1, NQO1, GCLM, and SQSTM1 levels are increased in AD and PD brains [62,63]. In this context, it is not surprising that NRF2 activation has been demonstrated to extend survival in AD [64], PD [65], and ALS [42] animal models.NRF2 deficiency has been found in several NDDs; for instance, the hippocampal neurons of AD patients showed a dramatic decrease in nuclear NRF2 [59], while animal models of PD, such as NRF2-knockout mice, showed a specific loss of dopaminergic neurons [60] and post-mortem studies of patients with ALS showed an increased KEAP1 mRNA in the motor cortex [61], leading to a decline in NRF2 activity.

        <p>KEAP1 is a Zn metalloprotein with 625 amino acid residues and it has a branched stem dimeric structure, formed by 5 domains [67]. The N-terminal region (NTR), the BTB/POZ (Bric-a-brac, tramtrac, broad-complex/proxvirus zinc fingers) domain, implicated in KEAP1 homodimerization and Cul3 association, the intervening region (IVR), which acts as a linker between BTB and DGR domains, the double glycine repeat (DGR) domain, important for NRF2 regulation and actin interaction and the C-terminal domain (CTR) [67] (Figure 6). The `hinge and latch' model [75] is the most widely accepted mechanism for KEAP1-dependent regulation. In this model, two different binding sites of NRF2 in the Neh2 domain interact with different affinities with a single overlapping site in the DGR domain of KEAP1, with the ETGE motif presenting higher affinity than DLG [76]. Under homeostatic conditions, the β-hairpin of the ETGE motif (high affinity) interacts with one of the KEAP1 subunits in a first step, which is called the open conformation [76,77]. This open conformation represents the "hinge", in which NRF2 can move in space relatively freely. In a second step, the β-hairpin of the DLG motif (low affinity) interacts similarly with a second protomer of KEAP1 in the so-called closed conformation, representing the "latch" [76,77].

        <p>Under oxidative stress conditions, NRF2 inducers oxidize the Cys residues present in KEAP1, promoting a conformational change [77]. This structural change in KEAP1 causes an improper spatial disposition of the target lysines, and thus NRF2 is no longer ubiquitinated nor degraded [78]. This leads to the saturation of KEAP1, and consequently any newly synthesized NRF2 can evade repression and directly accumulate into the nucleus, promoting its target gene expression [79]. KEAP1 is a cysteine-rich protein, being redox-active and reactive to the local environment [68]. The majority of KEAP1 cysteine residues are surrounded by basic amino acids that increase their reactivity by lowering their pKa values [69]. Thus, the 27 cysteine residues of KEAP1 are proposed to be the main sites through which the protein is able to sense electrophilic or oxidative stress [70]. Even though cysteines are distributed along the whole KEAP1 sequence, it has been proved that the C 273 , C 288 , and C 297 residues in the BTB/POZ domain [71] and C 151 in the IVR domain [72] are more reactive and serve as redox sensors for electrophiles, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and metals such as Cd 2+ , As 3+ , and Se 4+ [73].

        <p>Caffeic acid (2, Figure 7) is a polyphenol present in coffee bearing a Michael acceptor in its structure. Some studies reveal that this structure is responsible and essential for its NRF2 induction properties while its nucleophilic moiety (catechol moiety) provides clearance but it is not directly involved in NRF2 induction [84]. Further studies have shown that caffeic acid is also able to decrease KEAP1 expression to activate NRF2, leading to an increase in the expression of HO-1 (heme oxygenase 1) and NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1) [84].Caffeic acid (2, Figure 7) is a polyphenol present in coffee bearing a Michael acceptor in its structure.

The exact mechanism through which it induces NRF2 is not currently known, although in view of its structure, it can form lipoylcysteinyl disulfides with KEAP1, preventing NRF2 degradation [91,92]. Besides this potential mechanism, it has also been shown that alpha lipoic acid can activate protein kinase C (PKC), which is one of the kinases that is able to activate NRF2 through an alternative pathway [93]. Several studies on alpha lipoic acid neuroprotective effects have been carried out, although in many of them, it was not investigated whether NRF2 activation took part in these effects.

        <p>Sulforaphane (1, Figure 7) is an isothiocyanate produced from the enzymatic cleavage of the organosulfur compound glucoraphanin found in cruciferous plants such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and cabbage [1]. The catalytic reaction needed for the release of sulforaphane is driven by a β-thioglucosidase present in the gut microbiota [102]; thus, the levels of released sulforaphane are highly dependent on dietary habits and microbiome composition [102]. Sulforaphane directly interacts with the Cys151 residue in KEAP1, thereby promoting NRF2 activation [103,104]. Either in pure form or as sprout extract, sulforaphane has shown a very good safety profile, and more than 30 clinical studies against chronic diseases have been carried out [105,106]. It has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and it has shown neuroprotective capacity against Aβ 1-42 peptide in neuronal cells [107]. In vivo, sulforaphane alleviates cognitive impairment in mouse models of AD [108]. In PD models, it protected dopaminergic neurons against the parkinsonian toxin 6-hydroxydopamine [109]. Furthermore, sulforaphane is able to reduce the levels of phosphorylated tau and increase Beclin1 and LC3-II, leading to the conclusion that NRF2 activation may facilitate tau degradation through autophagy [56].

        <p>KEAP1 is the main regulator of NRF2, by promoting its degradation [8]. The NRF2 recognition by the Kelch domain included in KEAP1 is a classic example of a protein-protein interaction as a drug target, which, generally speaking, remains a challenge for drug discovery due to the large surface of the targeted area and the lack of pockets for the interaction with inhibitors. However, in the case of KEAP1, the target surface is about 300-1000 Å 2 in size and has well-defined pockets with residues capable of stably recognizing small molecules [135]. These topological characteristics, together with the availability of KEAP1 3D structures, allow the development of small molecules that are able to recognize KEAP1 and disrupt its binding with other proteins [136].KEAP1 is the main regulator of NRF2, by promoting its degradation [8].

        <p>The ETGE motif contained in the Neh2 domain of NRF2 adopts a β-hairpin conformation to interact with the KEAP1 Kelch domain-binding pocket, which can be artificially subdivided into five subpockets (Figure 11a) [136]. The P1 and P2 subpockets are characterized by the presence of multiple positively charged arginine residues (Arg415, Arg483, and Arg485), enabling these sites to recognize negatively charged amino acid residues of substrates [137]. In particular, the carboxyl side chains of Glu79 and Glu82 at the ETGE motif of NRF2 (Figure 11b) promote binding by their interaction with the P1 and P2 subpockets. The central P3 subpocket is formed by small polar and nonpolar residues that stabilize the ETGE motif. The external P4 and P5 subpockets are formed by aliphatic chain and tyrosine-rich residues and improve the substrate recognition through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds [136,137].The ETGE motif contained in the Neh2 domain of NRF2 adopts a β-hairpin conformation to interact with the KEAP1 Kelch domain-binding pocket, which can be artificially subdivided into five subpockets (Figure 11a) [136].

        <p>The Kelch domain in KEAP1 is able to interact with several additional proteins containing ETGE-like sequences in a similar manner to NRF2 [138]. Some of them, such as SQSTM1/p62 and prothymosin α (ProTα), are also related to the regulation or the NRF2-ARE pathway, or they are implicated in the crosstalk with other hallmarks of neurodegeneration, such as IKK-β (inhibitor of the nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta) in neuroinflammation [138].The Kelch domain in KEAP1 is able to interact with several additional proteins containing ETGE-like sequences in a similar manner to NRF2 [138].

        <p>The KEAP1 Kelch domain recognizes p62 through a KEAP1-interacting region (KIR) and this disrupts the KEAP1-NRF2 system, leading to a crosstalk between the NRF2-ARE pathway and p62 [139] (Figure 11c). The mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of this Ser349 elongates the side chain and adds negative charges to it, improving its recognition by KEAP1 (Figure 11d) [140]. The p62 protein is a cargo receptor for selective autophagy, and its strong interaction with KEAP1 allows it to sequester the latter into early autophagosomes, promoting its degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway [141]. Both the p62-mediated disruption of the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction and the p62-dependent degradation of KEAP1 increase the stability of NRF2, leading to neuroprotection [142]. Another ETGE-like substrate that can bind KEAP1 is ProTα, whose ENGE motif mediates its interaction with the KEAP1 Kelch domain (Figure 11e). The crystal structure of the KEAP1-ProTα complex shows a similar network of interactions to the NRF2 ETGE motif [143]. ProTα exhibits a neuroprotective profile against ischemia-reperfusion injury, which can be explained by its capacity to disrupt the NRF2-KEAP1 complex when present in a large excess [144,145].The KEAP1 Kelch domain recognizes p62 through a KEAP1-interacting region (KIR) and this disrupts the KEAP1-NRF2 system, leading to a crosstalk between the NRF2-ARE pathway and p62 [139] (Figure 11c).

        <p>KEAP1 also interacts with IKKβ, which plays a central role in the control of the pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway after phosphorylation and several downstream steps [146]. The recognition between KEAP1 and IKKβ promotes the degradation of the latter and prevents the phosphorylation of IKKβ, reducing neuroinflammation [147]. The interplay between the NRF2-ARE and NF-kB pathways seems especially interesting in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases and can be explained in part by the interaction of KEAP1 with NRF2 and IKKβ [147]. Although a crystal structure of the KEAP1-IKKβ complex is unavailable [148], it has been studied through protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic analysis, which show that the ETGE motif of IKKβ adopts a β-turn conformation [148], occupying the substrate-binding pocket in a similar fashion to that of the NRF2 ETGE motif (Figure 11f) [149].

        <p>Small peptides based on structural similarity to KEAP1 substrates were the earliest examples of molecules designed to act as KEAP1 inhibitors [150]. However, they have several limitations, including their inability to cross the BBB and their poor stability. Thus, the development of small molecules as KEAP1 binding disruptors remains the main approach, overcoming the bioavailability and stability issues associated to peptides [151]. HTS of a library of more than 300,000 compounds led to tetrahydroisoquinoline 19 (Figure 12) as the first-in-class small-molecule KEAP1-NRF2 PPI inhibitor [151]. Further research efforts on this scaffold led to new structure-activity relationships [152]. The naphthalene sulfonamide derivative 20a (Figure 12) was also identified as a KEAP1-NRF2 inhibitor in a fluorescence anisotropy assay [153]. Structural determination showed an interaction between 20a and the P3-P5 subpockets in the Kelch domain of KEAP1. Based on this finding, compound 20b (Figure 12) was designed [153] with its two carboxyl groups forming multiple hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with the basic Arg residues present in P1 and P2, thus improving the affinity with the KEAP1-NRF2 interface [153]. In the development process, the naphthalene core was replaced by an isoquinoline core to give 20c (Figure 12), improving the solubility, metabolic stability, and reducing the intrinsic toxicity of naphthalene scaffold [154]. Recently, the exploration of bioisosteric replacements of both carboxylic acids afforded the ditetrazole analogue 20d (Figure 12), which maintains the potent PPI inhibition activity and improves the cellular potency thanks to a better pharmacodynamic profile [155]. Another study demonstrated that oxadiazole-urea based compounds 21a-c (NK-252, Figure 12) interact with the KEAP1-Kelch domain [156], with the carboxylic group and the urea-oxadiazole structure interacting via hydrogen bonds and the phenyl moiety by π-stacking with the P1, P2 and P3 subpockets, respectively.Small peptides based on structural similarity to KEAP1 substrates were the earliest examples of molecules designed to act as KEAP1 inhibitors [150].

        <p>Research into KEAP1-NRF2 PPI inhibition is rapidly becoming a hot topic in medicinal chemistry, and it is evolving rapidly. In this context, the availability of crystal structures and a broad range of structural analyses related to recognition processes at the KEAP1-NRF2 complex have contributed to the development of several lead compounds by modern drug discovery strategies and the exploration of new chemical sources [152,157,161].

Therefore, PPI inhibitor design with high potential activity and improved physicochemical properties is crucial to develop a new generation of drugs with a better safety profile, compared to KEAP1 covalent inhibitors.Research into KEAP1-NRF2 PPI inhibition is rapidly becoming a hot topic in medicinal chemistry, and it is evolving rapidly. In this context, the availability of crystal structures and a broad range of structural analyses related to recognition processes at the KEAP1-NRF2 complex have contributed to the development of several lead compounds by modern drug discovery strategies and the exploration of new chemical sources [152,157,161].

Akt is a Ser/Thr kinase activated by several signals that produce phosphatidylinositol- (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) [189]. PIP3 serves as anchor for Akt and its activator kinase, PDK1, which activates Akt by phosphorylation at Thr308. Phosphorylated Akt is further activated by mTORC2 by phosphorylation at Ser473 [189].

        <p>The PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to Nrf2 induction in a KEAP1-independent mode, as described by Cuadrado et al. [190]. By using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, they observed a substantial inhibition of carnosol-mediated Nrf2 induction. Further evidence to support the regulation of Nrf2 induction by PI3K activation was obtained by using a biotinylated analogue of CDDO-Im, which is a potent Nrf2 inducer belonging to the cyanoenone triterpenoid family that activates the PI3K/Akt pathway because it reacts covalently with Cys124 inside the active site of PTEN [191], inhibiting its activity. Similarly, 4-hidroxynonenal (an Nrf2 inducer) modifies PTEN Cys71 [192]. The Cys71 and Cys124 residues of PTEN act as redox sensors and, when oxidized, they form a disulfide bridge inactivating the PIP3 3-phosphatase activity of PTEN and increasing the activity of Akt [193]. Therefore, PTEN is considered a negative repressor of Nrf2, acting as a redox sensor inside the cell; once it is inactivated, Nrf2 is activated via the PI3K/Akt pathway activation.The PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to Nrf2 induction in a KEAP1-independent mode, as described by Cuadrado et al.

        <p>It was demonstrated that PI3K activation leads to Nrf2 induction [173,194] by increasing Akt activity that, in turn, inhibits the activity of GSK-3β by phosphorylation at Ser9 [195] and Ser21 [196].

        <p>(b) β-TrCP. The PI3K/AKT pathway activates NRF2 via the inhibition of GSK-3β, which phosphorylates NRF2 [190], allowing its recognition by β-TrCP, which in turn marks NRF2 for ubiquitinylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation [200]. β-TrCP is an F-Box-containing protein of the WD40 subfamily that acts as substrate adaptor/receptor within the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase SCF β-TrCP [201] and participates in the ubiquination of IκB, β-catenin, CDC25, and APC [70], among others, besides NRF2. β-TrCP recognizes its substrates by direct binding to phosphorylated destruction motifs; for instance, it binds to phosphorylated NRF2 at its 343 DSGIS 347 and 382 DSAPGS 387 sequences [202]. Interestingly, this sequence mimics the GSK-3β target motifs, and thus many of the GSK-3β target proteins are known to be processed by β-TrCP for degradation [203]. Figure 14. KEAP1-independent negative regulation of NRF2. The latter protein is tightly regulated by different systems, independently of its principal repressor KEAP1, to ensure the activation of the phase II response only under stress conditions. From left, the activation of different pathways might lead to PI3K activation that activates AKT by phosphorylation that in turn, from right, was inhibited by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), PHLPP1/2 (PH domain and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatases 1 and 2), or tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). After its activation, AKT is able to phosphorylate GSK-3β at Ser 9 inhibiting its activity reducing the negative regulation of NRF2 by this kinase. GSK-3β is known to act as a negative NRF2 regulator by several mechanisms. NRF2 can be phosphorylated by this kinase at Ser335 and S338 to create a phosphodegron domain DSGIS recognized by β-TrCP that leads to Cul1/Rbx1 NRF2 ubiquination and proteasomal degradation. NRF2 is also regulated by a third ubiquitination-degradation system by interaction with Hrd1, at the Neh4 transactivation domain, which is a ubiquitin ligase that targets NRF2 for proteasomal degradation.(b) β-TrCP. The PI3K/AKT pathway activates NRF2 via the inhibition of GSK-3β, which phosphorylates NRF2 [190], allowing its recognition by β-TrCP, which in turn marks NRF2 for ubiquitinylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation [200]. β-TrCP is an F-Box-containing protein of the WD40 subfamily that acts as substrate adaptor/receptor within the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase SCF β-TrCP [201] and participates in the ubiquination of IκB, β-catenin, CDC25, and APC [70], among others, besides NRF2. β-TrCP recognizes its substrates by direct binding to phosphorylated destruction motifs; for instance, it binds to phosphorylated NRF2 at its 343 DSGIS 347 and 382 DSAPGS 387 sequences [202]. Interestingly, this sequence mimics the GSK-3β target motifs, and thus many of the GSK-3β target proteins are known to be processed by β-TrCP for degradation [203]. Figure 14.

        <p>It was demonstrated that PI3K activation leads to Nrf2 induction [173,194] by increasing Akt activity that, in turn, inhibits the activity of GSK-3β by phosphorylation at Ser9 [195] and Ser21 [196]. Furthermore, GSK-3β can also be inhibited by PKC [197], P70S6K, and P90RSK [198], all of which are regulated by PI3K through PDK1 [199].It was demonstrated that PI3K activation leads to Nrf2 induction [173,194] by increasing Akt activity that, in turn, inhibits the activity of GSK-3β by phosphorylation at Ser9 [195] and Ser21 [196].

        <p>By using selective GSK-3β inhibitors or siRNAs targeting GSK-3β, a stabilization and nuclear localization of NRF2 was initially observed. Similar results were obtained by using siRNAs toward β-TrCP, demonstrating the regulation of NRF2 by both proteins. The Neh6 domain of NRF2 presents two motifs, DSGIS and DSAPGS, that can be recognized by SCF β-TrCP once they are phosphorylated [204]. Thus, the GSK-3β/β-TrCP system induces NRF2 ubiqination via β-TrCP/Cul1in1/Rbx1 E3 ligase complex after phosphorylation, being a KEAP1-independent mechanism activated by receptor signal transduction [205]. Considering this regulatory mechanism, a hypothesis of "dual modulation" by KEAP1 and β-TrCP was proposed by Cuadrado et al. [77]. Therefore, β-TrCP is a fine tune regulator of NRF2 for cell signaling, considering the high number of proteins regulated by Nr2 with a high impact on metabolic adaptation [78].By using selective GSK-3β inhibitors or siRNAs targeting GSK-3β, a stabilization and nuclear localization of NRF2 was initially observed.

        <p>(c) DJ-1. In another connection to NDDs, a direct link between DJ-1, a protein involved in PD, and Nrf2 has been described. DJ-1 inactivation in PD is related to a higher susceptibility of neurons to oxidative stress [206]. Compelling evidence demonstrates that DJ-1 acts as a negative regulator of PTEN [207]. Therefore, DJ-1 downregulation reduces Nrf2 activity due to the increased activity of PTEN. Furthermore, DJ-1 presents several ROS-sensitive Cys residues that can act as oxidative stress sensors. Finally, it has been proposed that DJ-1 can act as a nitric oxide-transferring protein to PTEN Cys residues to inhibit its activity [208].(c) DJ-1.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor of the bHLH/PAS family that mediates the effects of many xenobiotics (e.g., polyaromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins) and endogenous compounds [209]. It is widespread in the nervous system and, among others, regulates neuronal functions [209]. Miao et al. showed that the transcription of NRF2 is directly regulated by AHR [210], and in fact, they exhibit both ARE and XRE response elements in their promoter region. Moreover, they share several common antioxidant target genes [211].(a) AHR.

        <p>(b) P53. The P53 protein, known as the guardian of the genome, is a transcription factor that is activated by DNA damage, regulating the pathways for cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence, and apoptosis. Indeed, it has been proposed that p53 may contribute to neuronal death processes common to all NDDs [212]. There are several connections between the NRF2 and p53 pathways [213]. First, the activation of p53 induces the expression of p21, which competes with KEAP1 for binding to NRF2 and prevents NRF2 degradation, rising its levels [214]. Moreover, NRF2 induces the expression of NQO1, which hinders the degradation of p53 by the 20S proteasome [215].(b) P53.

        <p>(c) Epigenetic regulation. As in the case of KEAP1, the transcription of NRF2 is subject to epigenetic regulation via methylation of the NRF2 promoter in CpG islands, H3 histone methylation, and H4 histone acetylation [216]. There is some evidence showing that DNA-methyltransferase inhibition during brain development increases susceptibility to oxidative DNA damage in the aged brain via the hypomethylation of promoters of AD-associated genes such as the β-amyloid precursor protein [217]. Interestingly, DNA demethylation by treatment with 5-azacytidine (31, Figure 15) was shown to upregulate NRF2 expression in an AD cellular model. [218] In the same context, it has been proven that one of the mechanisms of neuroprotection by sulforaphane (1, Figure 15) in mouse neuroblastoma cells is an upregulated NRF2 expression and promoted NRF2 nuclear translocation by decreasing the methylation levels of the NRF2 promoter gene [219].(c) Epigenetic regulation.

Studies in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells showed that the overexpression of these miRs suppresses NRF2 activity by targeting its mRNA, leading to uncontrolled redox homeostasis [220]. Accordingly, schisandrin B (32, Figure 15), a dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan found in the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Schisandra chinensis, has shown neuroprotective effects in 6-OHDA PD models by acting as an inhibitor of miR-34a action [221]. Many miRs are involved in the pathological events after cerebral stroke, and among them, miR 93 has been found to be a negative regulator of Nfr2 expression that contributes significantly to deregulation of the redox balance in ischemia [222]. On the other hand, miR-424 upregulates NRF2, and its overexpression has an antioxidant effect in focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in mice that is suppressed by NRF2 knockdown and treatment with SOD inhibitors [223].

        <p>(a) MAPKs. These enzymes are serine/threonine kinases that modulate crucial biological processes including cell survival [226,230], apoptosis [228,231], and gene expression [227,230].

NRF2 regulation by different MAPK pathways has been widely described by the NRF2 activity can also be regulated by microRNAs, which repress protein production by interacting with complementary seed sequences in the UTR of target mRNAs. Several miRs are involved in direct NRF2 regulation and are related with neurological disorders associated with oxidative stress [168].

        <p>(b) P38. The P38 MAPK family comprises several isoforms (P38α, β, γ and δ) with specific distribution and substrates. Once activated by phosphorylation, they in turn phosphorylate different proteins and transcription factors to regulate processes including inflammation, cell division, and differentiation or apoptosis [235]. P38 kinases are mainly activated by oxidative stress [236], which is a pathological hallmark of NDDs. P38 has been related to AD, since it is activated by the Aβ peptide and hyperphosphorylated tau through oxidative stress [237]. In this line, the P38 pathway was described to be overactive in AD brains at initial stages [238]. The general consensus points to a negative regulation of NRF2 by P38 MAPK as shown by Keum et al., who described the active p38 isoforms that are able to phosphorylate the NRF2 protein to reduce its nuclear accumulation [239]. P38 MAPK phosphorylates NRF2 at three Ser residues (Ser215, Ser408, and Ser577), improving its interaction with KEAP1 and thus promoting its degradation [9]. Conversely, p38 activation activated the NRF2-ARE pathway [240,241] after the administration of several xenobiotics, which is an observation that was correlated with the inhibitory activity of P38 on GSK-3β [239]. Most probably, the activity of P38 on NRF2 depends of small modifications of the homeostatic equilibrium, and the final response depends on the stimuli, timing, and cellular type.(b) P38.

        <p>(c) JNK. The c-jun-NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is activated mainly by stress stimuli and is an important member of the MAPK signaling pathways [242], playing important roles in development, cell growth, inflammation, and apoptosis [243]. JNKs are a family of threonine protein kinases that includes three different isoforms (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3), the latter of which is specifically expressed in the central nervous system [244] and is considered a key target for NDDs. JNK3 has been found to be activated in AD [245], PD [246], ALS, and stroke [247], among other NDDs. Sustained JNK activation has been widely related to pathological conditions promoting cell damage and death and has also been correlated with decreased NRF2 signaling. Recently, a direct crosstalk between JNK and NRF2 has been revealed in the context of protection against liver injury induced by acetaminophen, which is closely associated to JNK activation [248]. Active JNK (p-JNK) increased NRF2 turnover by direct interaction with the Neh1 domain of NRF2. This interaction allows the phosphorylation of Ser residues at Neh6 degron domain of NRF2. Thus, it was demonstrated that p-JNK phosphorylates Ser335 at DSGIS motif of NRF2, codifying its degradation through a KEAP1-independent mechanism [249].(c) JNK.

        <p>(d) ERKs. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) are a major MAPK subfamily involved in a large number of biological processes. ERK activation has been highly related to cytoprotection, specifically to neuroprotection, linking this kinase pathway to potential targets against NDDs [250]. NRF2 regulation by the ERK pathway has been reported in many different cellular types, and it has been implicated in the mechanism of action of several NRF2 inducers. tBHQ, a known NRF2 inducer [132], increases NRF2 stability inducing the activation of the phase II response in a ERK1/2-dependent mechanism, since its NRF2 induction capacity was abolished in the presence of ERK inhibitors [251]. ERK activation was demonstrated to be necessary for NRF2-ARE signaling in response to several other NRF2 inducers such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate [252], caffeic acid [253], sulfuretin [254], gallic acid [254], luteolin [255], and butylated hydroxyanisole [256] in HepG2 cells; lico A in RAW 264.7 cells (26576227), or phenylethanoid glycoside in PC12 cells. Some reports suggest a potential direct crosstalk between NRF2 and ERK1/2 by which activated ERK1/2 might be able to directly phosphorylate NRF2 at Ser40, codifying its nuclear stabilization to increase NRF2-ARE pathway activation [257]. This hypothesis is supported by an increase of p-Ser40-NRF2 protein levels measured by Western blot. However, a direct interaction of ERK1/2 and NRF2 has not been fully proven, and other pathways might be contributing such as PKC, JNK, or Akt [257].(d) ERKs.

        <p>(e) PKC. This protein is part of a family of serine/threonine kinases related to many cellular signaling responses including apoptosis, survival, and differentiation. Although PKC activation is traditionally considered receptor-dependent, there is also a ROS-dependent activation mechanism [258]. The discovery that phorbol esters (PKC activators) induce the expression of NRF2-related proteins led to hypothesize the regulation of NRF2-phase II response by PKC [228]. It was proved that, together with other kinases [229], PKC phosphorylates Ser40 at the NRF2Neh2 domain, disrupting the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction [259]. Ser40 phosphorylation is necessary for its nuclear translocation, but it does not facilitate its nuclear accumulation [260]. A second NRF2 regulation mechanism by PKC is related to the capacity of several PKC isoforms (α, β 1 , γ &gt; β 2 ; not ε) to phosphorylate GSK-3β at inactivation sites [261]. Focusing on NDDs, PKC protein levels and activity was found to be decreased in AD brains [262]. Considering the positive modulation of NRF2 by PKC and other potentially beneficial properties, several PKC activators have been proposed as potential drugs for AD treatment [263].(e) PKC.

        <p>(f) CK2. Casein kinase II (CK2) is a Ser/Thr kinase that acts on more than 300 substrates, participating in the regulation of many different processes including signal transduction, gene transcription, replication processes, and survival pathways, among others. Among the processes modulated by CK2, it regulates several key regulators against cell stress [264]. CK2 is also related to NRF2 modulation, since its sequence presents at least 13 potential phosphorylation positions targeted by CK2 [265]. By using deletional analyses of NRF2, Neh4 and Neh5 domains were identified as CK2 target regions where this kinase is able to phosphorylate several residues, inducing NRF2 nuclear accumulation and pathway activation [265].(f) CK2.

        <p>(g) Fyn kinase. Fyn kinase, a member of the Src family, is closely related to the negative regulation of NRF2. Fyn kinase directly phosphorylates NRF2 at Tyr568 to codify its nuclear export [266].

Figure 16. A summary of the main NRF2 regulation mechanisms. KEAP1 represents the main negative regulatory protein of NRF2 coding its proteasomal degradation to maintain its expression at low levels. KEAP1-NRF2 interaction can be blocked by the activity of proteinprotein inhibitors, MAPKs and p62. Hrd1 also induces NRF2 proteasomal degradation, helping its regulation. Once activated, NRF2 induces the expression of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and proteostasis-related genes promoting neuronal survival. Under pathological conditions, several signals can induce the activation of different kinases and factors that negative regulate NRF2 promoting its degradation. When this intricate regulatory system is dysregulated by a pathological condition, the failure of the NRF2-ARE pathway has been correlated to the advance of the disease. Figure 16.
