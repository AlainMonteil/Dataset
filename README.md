SoFAIR Annotations Gold Standard Dataset 

The dataset to be used in the annotation process has been drawn from papers hosted by CORE. There are a total of 4058 papers split across 13 domains. All papers in the dataset have a DOI and the domain for each paper was identified from its DOI using an updated version of the methodology first introduced by [1]. 

The majority of papers have a single classification however some papers are classified with more than one label. These duplicate classifications are detailed in the duplicate_label_report contained in this repository. 

In addition to the PDF file, the following metadata is available for each paper:

core_id, 
title, 
DOI, 
domain, 
publication year. 

All papers are from 2019 onwards. 

There is a single zip file which contains 13 sub-directories, one per domain. Files are named as core_id.pdf. The zip file is too large for GitHub or GDrive storage so can be downloaded directly from CORE here:

Additionally, there is a spreadsheet with the metadata for all papers included in this repository.
